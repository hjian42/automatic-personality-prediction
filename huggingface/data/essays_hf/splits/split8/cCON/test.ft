__label__label1 Well, I figured I should write this right now while I have time. I am really busy lately. It kind of seems like I have no time for myself anymore. I am trying out for crew. There are a lot of people trying out though. I think like 000 people are going for 00 spots. I hope I make it though because I don't deal well with failure. I tried out for the soccer team and did not make it, but that was a little unfair because I did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did. So now everyone probably thinks I just wasn't good enough when that really was not the reason. I was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill. Oh well. I guess it taught me how to cope with failure. But it really hurts every time I fail. I tried to get into the business school and was denied. That got me so mad. There are all of these total morons in the business school. I know because I take classes with them and always make better grades than them. But alas, they can do what they want with their lives they entered right out of high school. Oh well. I am still going pre-law so it doesn't matter. Unfortunately my roommate and a lot of my friends are in it, so it is a constant reminder that I did not get in. But I think that all of this just makes me a stronger person. I am trying to be really involved this year. I am lifeguarding for the rec center. It is kind of fun, but I kind of dread going to work all the time. I just seem to have a lot of things on my plate. I had a fight with my boyfriend the other day. I am not sure if it was his fault or if I caused it because of all the stress I am under. Oh well. I think that things have really changed between me and my roommate too. Last year we used to be like best friends, but now things are different. She seems to be really distant. I am not sure what is wrong with her. Maybe it is my fault. I am not around as much as I used to be, so maybe she just wants more attention and is finding it elsewhere. She also has a boyfriend, so she spends a lot of time with him, which is fine with me. I just feel like things have totally changed. She went to a party last night and didn't invite me. Weird. I think I am really different from most people. I always seem to put everyone else's feelings before mine. I just don't understand why people don't do that. Or maybe I don't understand why I do that. Like, I would invite everyone to come with me if I was doing something cool. But all the people around me just I think are selfish. Maybe I just need to find a whole new group of friends. I mean, I had my first day of tryouts for crew, which was a pretty big deal to me. And when I see my boyfriend, he doesn't even ask how I did. He totally forgot about it. That gets me so mad. He seems to forget about everything. He then says how he is a bad boyfriend. Unfortunately, I have to agree with him. But don't get the wrong impression of me. I am actually a very happy person. I am just going through a lull right now. Once I get into a normal routine in my life I think I will be a lot happier. I just wish that my family was here. My parents live in LOCNAME, and it is hard with them so far away. At least my brother is here with me. That makes it a lot easier. I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here. I never realized how dependent I was on other people. I always thought of myself as a kind of loner, but I guess I really am not. I like being around people, and maybe I do get jealous when they do not choose to be with me. I think I really need to work on the jealousy thing. That is probably why I am having problems with my boyfriend. He finally made some friends here, so he hangs out with them. I think I also don't really trust him. I don't want him sharing intimate things about us to them. He was asking me the other day why I back away from intimacy and am afraid to talk about it. I just don't like talking about it. I consider it a private thing, and should just be shared between two people. It is nobody else's business. But I guess since we are in college, that is the way things are. Sex is on everyone's mind. But it just doesn't really seem to be on my mind very much. I would much rather just cuddle that have sex. Maybe I am weird, I don't know. But that drives my boyfriend crazy. He want's to have sex all the time. I think that is a major problem in our relationship. Oh well. Well, I guess my time is about up. I now have to go to crew again. I should do good today because it is strength training. I am pretty confident about that. Well, I guess I only have one more of these to write. That relieves some of my stress. Actually this was pretty cool doing this. I could just write down what I have been keeping inside. Pretty neat. 
__label__label0 I don't like having to write an my couch. I need a better place to work. I don't want to go to work tonight. I sometimes feel like a trained animal jumping through a hoop. I really want a dog. Somebody that will always be there for me. I thought I had that in my boyfriend. I was always there for him Why is it that I always find the guys that I like or care about are unstable. Is it because I myself am unstable and I want someone else to make me feel better about my soft insanity. Or do I project such an image of  pure stability that they desire. I would like to be in a stable right now. Talking to a stable and then an unstable person, while grooming a horse. I want a horse to be able to ride him fast an hard through an open field to a tree that I could climb. The last time I climbed a tree I was trying to escape being pursued by a guy who had a girlfriend. I should have probably just told him no. Should I be more aggressive? I think that I am not because I can feel at times so much what other people are feeling. I don't them to be hurt by me because I myself have been hurt enough. I have always wished for an average American family A dog, a house with a fence, 0. 0 kids. I never got that though. I am beginning to realize that I am glad that I didn't. I like the person I am very much. I still need much more from myself though. I wonder why I surround myself with the things that I do. Why do I make my home a haven. Why I am afraid. Why do I have ORGNAME videos for kids or feel the need to buy myself flowers. I need more books I want more knowledge I don't want to be another close-minded individual in this cruel and cynical world. oxymoron. PROPNAME would like The Picture of Dorian Gray. I hope he will read it. Where am I right now  what do I need to be doing to get to my destination. I need to allow God back into my life. I need to stop shutting him out. I need to vacuum, and do laundry, paint, to do my chemistry, and talk to my soon to be ex-boyfriend. That is scary. I am going to alone again Why do I fear that so much. Maybe I am looking for the father I never had  I need someone to be there to praise me. I need to spend more time with more people. I put myself into seclusion to much But I like it My bicycles wheels are awfully big. they are huge,  I don't understand why guys always wish that they had a bigger penis even when they are large in the first place. Why do I have such a sexual mind. Have I Made myself that way for guys or am I naturally this way. Few things are natural anymore. I want to go camping and run through the Forrest naked like a nymph or a fairy. I want to appear magical to all those around me. 
__label__label1   So far I have been at LOCNAME for I guess 0 school days, and I can already feel myself slipping. School was so much simpler in middle and elementary school. Why can't I go back?  Let’s see. what did I do today?  I woke up around 0 (we have lives around here), and  was bugging my sister to take me to church. I haven't been there since I don't know how long, but I need to start going again. my ex-boyfriend called and I don't know how it made me feel. I want to be free of him and not have to deal with any of his problems. I don't want to desert him, but I don't know what he wants from me and what I can possibly do for him. it wasn't a really serious relationship and to tell the truth I have no idea what I was thinking when I went out with him. he's not my type at all and my parents would be so disappointed if they found out. thank goodness it's over already. I don't know how I feel about him. I would like to be his friend, but that's it, and I also don't know what he wants. isn't this depressing?  Guys. Don't they all suck?  I wrote my would-have-been-boyfriend in high school and for some silly reason I am still waiting for him to reply. I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe things will work out in the next ten years or so. I get really tired and depressed when I think about my ex and I don't know what to do about it. I want to be his friend, but I know he wants more and I don't think I can offer him that. I need to ask him what he wants or rather expects from me. He comes from a broken home and has a LOT of problems that I don't want to deal with. He's from LOCNAME LOCNAME and asked me to come down for his birthday. Funny I was actually considering it. what's wrong with me?  I called my little sister (00 yrs. old) and she wasn't home. Neither were my parents. I think they are at my aunt's house eating as usual. they live in new orleans and I miss them a lot. I need to come back and visit and I don't think I can do that until Christmas vacation. that sounds a lot better than Christmas  break. It really bothers me that I didn't capitalize most of the words that should be capitalize, but I shouldn't be worried about that right?  I am so unenergized right now. I need to go jogging or something, but it is late. I can't believe PROPNAME PROPNAME died. PROPNAME PROPNAME also died, yet she didn't get as much attention as Princess PROPNAME. So much has happened in my short 00 years life span. I can actually tell my kids that I was alive when Princess Di and PROPNAME PROPNAME died. it seems as if everyone is dying. isn't that sad?  I just found out that an acquaintance of mines is pregnant again. I don't know how to feel. this isn't her first pregnancy and she should know better. what is this world coming to?  my cousin is going through a break up right now and I don't know what I can do to help. I know she can do better than him, but I also know that she likes him a lot. What's a girl to do?  I am really relieved that I don't have a boyfriend anymore, yet why am I still commenting on that?  I was a lot better before he called. I just wish he could disappear and I don't know. he really needs to straighten out his life. you know what the funny thing is?  I think that the bad guys are the guys that like you more. it may not be true, but when it is, it is. let my rephrase that. when a guy that's on the wrong side falls (for you), they fall hard. I don't know if anyone has fallen for me yet. it is midnight and I still have other things to do. thank goodness I remembered about this. I actually don't mind typing like this. this is just like one of my journal pages that I try to do at least twice a week. I really believe that it serves as a stress reliever and should be done more often. well it's been 00 minutes so I’m outta here. lan ngoc ngo       
__label__label0 I had just returned from other interesting dinner experience at my frat house when I realized that I was just wasting time as usual. So I decided I'd turn on the old computer and do a little stream of consciousness writing. I'm sitting down at my knew desk, that to tell you the truth, has done me no good except for a good place to put my computer. My roommate, an old friend I've know throughout my life is out doing his fraternity B. S. and probably won't be back until twelve. This I really do think is funny because coming into school I was completely busy from day one, while he just sat on his beanbag chair and watched t. v. To tell you the truth all I really care about any more is the amount of time I get to spend sitting in my beanbag chair watching t. v. Although it's not really as fun as it may seem, because while sitting in the beanbag chair the only thing on your mind is when you're going to have to get up and go do stuff. I realized today in class that when one begins to get about half the amount of sleep that he used to get it does become a little bit irritating and depressing. All I can think about is when I can rest may days have turned from full productive days with good night sleeps over the summer to half ass, sit around and make up excuse my I shouldn't leave the room so I can get some sleep worthless days. I'm pretty sure that last sentence made absolutely no sense, so on that last thought I think  I'm going to leave the room for the umpteenth time today and go do things that I really wish I could accomplish by getting into bed and closing my eyes. 
__label__label0 I don't know what I am going to do in this. This type of assignment is something I have not done before. I guess I have no idea is because that I do not have a topic to write on. I have always have had a topic assigned to me. This is el-hazard music. Just by looking at the images of the CD cover, I can tell that this is going to be good. In fact, I am listening to it right now. I have no idea why I am writing this down in here, but it is a part of my thought. This has a lot of base, but it does not stick out. Has a very good balance of treble and base. What am I going to write about. I am hungry. May be I can go to kinsolving later. I think that they start dinner at four thirty. Another track has started. This is a slow song now. It is the music from the fourth episode where the demon goddess is freed from her master's control and gained her freedom for the first time. The cat  Ura was cool. She can mountain climb. I think that was a cliff. She is the coolest cat ever. I have to do this for 00 minutes. What oh yes the ura. The series is El-hazard. They don't have anything good on the internet on it. this sucks. I have to download that song tonight. I hope this time the connection is good enough. Why is some of the music stupid. Wait, if I listen to this closely, it is very good if the voice of the actress is older. The story has good development. The ova series starts with the discovery of the demon goddess ORGNAME in a certain high school and the main guy is sent to the world El-hazard through a portal created by PROPNAME. Why is the TV series different from the OAV series. The princess PROPNAME PROPNAME looks cute, I like her better in the OVA series. I think a world like el-hazard lives in our hearts. PROPNAME PROPNAME was rescued by the teacher. That was cool. PROPNAME kick. There were this little girl in the story. She was PROPNAME. The 0 priestess was pretty. fire, wind and water. Reminds me of Ah megamisama. 00 minutes. Ifurita was awakened by junnai. Then he and Ifurita invaded  PROPNAME the kingdom of El-hazard. They had to use the eye of god for defense. The TV series was called the wanderers. that was cool. The main guy can access ancient relics. He gave back ifurita her freedom by turning off the master obey chip. The war was still going on the LOCNAME used the eye of god. Kimdom of bugrom got kicked. The shadow nation intervened. The moved the eye of god out of control for the revenge a long time ago. They were remnant of the tribe that come across this world when the eye was first fired. They were hated afterwards. PROPNAME. I am hooked on this series too much. The main guy got control of the eye through Ifurita but Ifurita sustained the impact and was transported to the location where the high school will be in 00000 years. Ifurita then waited 00000 years for makoto to appear and send makoto to the land of el-hazard. After the impact, Ifurita learned the secret of eye of god. It is a dimensional cannon. what was cool. is it 00 minutes yet. Still 0 minutes. Have I been keeping time correctly. KOR orange road. I am still listening to the same music. cool. I can't wait to see the TV series tape # 0. It is going to be very good. I don't know I guess I am too excited about this thing to stop, I have not even realized I stayed on the same topic for long. men. 
__label__label1   There is this chomping sound coming from my brothers mouth. He's eating cereal. Sometimes I am jealous of this, because he  has his own place with a kitchen and food and everything. Even  PROPNAME has his own place with a kitchen and everything. Someday  I will have these things for myself. My own life, with my own things. Like in Days of Our Lives. There will be days of my life when I  do what I want, with whomever I choose. Until then I must continue  doing things their way . Everyone else’s way, like my mom. My nose  itches. It is a very natural thing to scratch an itch, or itch a  scratch?  It is very annoying to itch. When I got sunburned, I  itched extremely badly. PROPNAME laughed at me because I was jumping  around in discomfort. I never want to feel like that again. Sunburns suck. I miss PROPNAME though. Even though I did not see her  much, I always knew she was just down the street. But things are  different now. That made it sad for me to leave. The fact that  she isn't down the street anymore. That was like a security for me. Just knowing. I am in a hurry to finish this assignment. I have to be in class in about half an hour, and I am nowhere close to where I need to be. Life can make you feel like that. Like you are never at the right point, where you need to be. Everything in never alright. That's and oxy-moron. Things don't  work that way. But things do tend to work themselves out. You just  have to keep moving to get through the bad stuff. I always want  something better. I feel like I am always in transit. It's had for  me to be happy with the present. At least I can let go of the past, now. That was an accomplishment for me, not to dwell on memories anymore. Still, I look forward to, and fear the future. I do know things are good  now. I am on my own, a little bit. I don't want to rush things. I am in no hurry to grow up. Well, not a big hurry at least. I do want the rest of my life to come. I want to marry PROPNAME, have  a house, and pets. I am going to have a rabbit. Maybe two. Kids  eventually, but not for a long while. The television is such a distraction!  I can get side tracked forever. I like how it takes me out of this life. It is definitely  an escape. 
__label__label1 As I sit here in my dorm room, I am thinking about what I am supposed to do tonight. I have signed with the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu and I am not sure what pledging is going to be like. It could be tough and it could be easy. My roommate is here and he is going to take a nap so I need to try to be quiet as I type. I am kind of anxious about this year and what the year will be like. There are so many people here and I am not sure whether I am fitting in well or not. Anyway, I get side tracked easily. I am going to the house at 0 PM and there we are going to be introduced to all the older guys and then we will probably introduce ourselves to the rest of the pledge class. I am anxious to meet all the cool guys who I am going to be spending the rest of my life with in college and hopefully there after also. I miss all my close friends at home. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME and they are mostly going to ORGNAME but some of them are spread out across the country. I miss my friend PROPNAME the most and my best friend PROPNAME the 0nd most but hey I hope they come and visit but if they don't oh well. My mom worries me cause she thinks I am doing alot of bad thing s here at school but really I’m not and I am being a good kid and trying to make good grades. I miss my little brother too. he is 00 years old and he is in 0th grade. I hope that he is having fun in junior high school cause I know I did. I keep telling him that high school is the best time of your life. He believes me but he cannot wait until next year when he can go to high school. My great grandmother is very sick and she is 00 years old. I went to visit her the day before I left for school and I was thinking that I may never see her again. She has lived a long and happy life and whenever the time comes, I know that god was the one who wanted her up there. M<y roommate is going to nap now for real and I am supposed to wake him up in an hour. I hope I’m not still typing by then. The room is quiet now and I am the only one still making noise. My suite mates are all out at class and they will be back soon. I kind of always think about what I am going to be when I get older and when I am married and who am I going to marry and what my profession is going to be. I want to be an orthopedic surgeon but that is very hard to be and I am not sure if I can be that. But I set my goals already and that is my destiny for my future. I want to be successful and have a family of 0 and a nice looking, perfect wife who loves me for who I am not for what I look like or how much money I make. I am ending my stories with a quote :Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you will be amongst the stars. 
__label__label0 Stream of consciousness, I just ate breakfast and my stomach hurts, my stomach hurt when I got in my first accident two years ago. stupid car, I got in a wreck just recently I was going down the road and I came to a usual stop behind a car sat there for about 0 sec an the stupid ford ranger just came billowing into my rear end and crushed it, what are you looking for, would this be considered paranoia,  why do you care so much about what I am thinking, I want to go home some times but to the home you see in movies, the ones with home cooked meals and clean rooms or even sofas to sleep on and it would be a good experience. I really want a dog, my do at home really sucks, she is old and acts like a cat, a robber came into our house a few years ago and the dog peed on itself the ran away, stupid dog. do you think I hold allot of hostility, I like to portray I don't care what anyone thinks, but that is not always true because some time to reach my goal I have to care a little bit, stupid hormones. you probably will not even read this so I guess it really does not matter exactly what I say. I wonder how long these things usually are, mine based on the amount of time I have spent writing will be four lines long, but those are some really long lines. I thing the guy next to me is hitting enter, so his is longer than mine. you know your class is too big it is hard to get any interaction so it gets boring. I tell my friend he has , he is not my friend, but I tell him he has no tact, but when I think about it neither do I and I grub with my money because I do not have much of it too spend I am 'a broke bitch!!' actually my lines are probably going to add up to about 0, but that is cool, the gut next to me has not written for 00 min, but hey jip the man, that is my motto, take as much as you can and get your moneys worth, I leave the lights on all the time in my dorm room because I want to waste electricity, and I leave the water running in the sink when I brush my teeth!!  yeah jip the man. I really want a computer in my room and it is upsetting that I do not have one because I have had one all my life and I am supposed to start right now not having one what kind of cruel god designated the lot in my life for. I want to learn to hack into very large computer and take control of them, haha!! I will the most powerful man in the world,  my and my delusions of grandure@idiot. com. what ever, I figured out that that could be take as an insult, doesn't surprise me though, people take to much to the heart these days!  this girl I met she is a room mate of a friend of mine, but she is constantly telling people about her promissory ring and about her boy friend, but then after a party she messes around with my best friend, it is not that I am jealous of he so much that he got to mess around with her but the fact she did it at all, he gets some much action. I kind of respected her bitchiness, but then she had to go off and just go back on everything she said. dork. I am kind of jealous of the fact that PROPNAME messed, really broke her, that is kind of cool, and I wish I got to do it just for the reason of doing it. I really need to get a girl friend, I want some one I can rely on every once on in a while. beats the hell out of me,  girls are too confusing. music can control my feelings, NIN can send an adrenaline rush at me hard core. I drink too much when I drink. I do not drink all the time it is just when I do I drink too muck of it, so nothing can stop me now. I am out, this is cool I might do this again. later. 
__label__label1 My neighbor from across the hall is letting me use her computer because she is online. I went to PROPNAME and the lab was closed, that stunk. I'm very tired because I did not get very much sleep last night. Some girls on my wing and I were going to go to some Frat parties, but we wound up staying in the dorm and watching movies. It turns out one of my roommate’s friends is also in this psy. class, I thought that was really neat, although the class is so huge, it doesn't surprise me. I haven't seen very many of my high school friends here at LOCNAME, I really didn't want to talk about college because that is the other assignment, but it seems to be the most foremost thing on my mind right now. The ORGNAME are kicking off their season tomorrow at noon!!!  I worked for them for about nine months, so I am somewhat obligated to watch, that and the fact that my step-father has been a fan for 00 years or so. I was able to get him a bluebook autographed by PROPNAME PROPNAME for Father's Day this year!  I really enjoyed giving that to him I love giving gifts, it's my most favorite thing to do!!!  I love to make people happy and some people think I'm crazy for that, but I think it's great. That's another reason I have enjoyed my intern ship with the ORGNAME so much. When I get a letter about a sick child, my heart sinks and to know that sending something from the ORGNAME will make them feel better or at least distract from the state they are in. Let's see 0 more minutes of writing. My roommate and I were talking about our special talents, I told her mine was finding holes in sidewalks!!  Yes, if I walk down LOCNAME, I WILL fall in every hole and look like a fool in front of at least 00 people that happen to be walking by!! That is something else, hey!! I just found out that my step-mom got a new car, and my dad bought her old one from her. This is a man who says he cannot send me $000 a month, but can take a two week vacation to LOCNAME LOCNAME and buy a new car in the same month!! Anyway, that subject somewhat depresses me. ok 0 more minutes of writing, I can handle it, hey I'll bet you can tell I'm a slow typer now, can't ya!!! Well it sure has been great talking to you. And as our good friend PROPNAME would say: Goodbye and good luck.     
__label__label0 Philosophy. can one truly think that one knows nothing?  If one truly thinks that one knows nothing, doesn't that mean that he in fact truly knows something. that he knows nothing. If God is omnipotent can he make a rock so heavy he can't carry it?  God. If he were the perfect God why hasn't he made himself present to the entire world?  How can this world think so highly ORGNAME itself that it thinks it has found the right religion already. Maybe the true God has never been seen, has never been thought, has never been written down before. There always exists the possibility that perhaps the world came about in a way no one has every thought of before. It's possible and very probable. Can one truly put all his faith in God. If God is an almighty, omnipotent being, can one put his entire life into God's hands?  But then God says not to be foolish. Is it foolish to want an explanation. Maybe the confusion is meant for a reason. Have to get an application to ORGNAME of ORGNAME. To be a genius wouldn't be so bad. It wouldn't be that great either. Everything has its ups and downs, black, white, heaven, hell, etc. Perhaps the goal is to reach a true balance. Maybe then we'll be content. Then again to be content and balanced you would have to have some discontent. Fashion is definitely too emphasized in this world. When will comfort be in?  It will probably take off like a forest fire. People will realize there are plenty of more important things than clothes and appearance. Of course that doesn't mean stop bathing and wearing dirty clothes. People need to get priorities straight. Why waste your time taking a speeding ticket to court. Time is money. Time is more valuable than money. Without time we are nothing. Without money, we are without money. Time will never wait nor come back. Smurfs. I remember Smurfs. Back in the childhood days when things weren't so complicated. A tiny blue creature was simply a tiny blue creature. Not a tiny conniving blue wench searching for self promotion or upholding a social image or making the extra buck. It was a time of snowmen and berry fights and rope swinging and rock climbing and tadpole watching. Nothing more, nothing less but perhaps invaluable. 
__label__label1 I really am tired. I can't understand why I have so much to do and I haven't even started maybe I'm just lazy and I don't think. Could be I'm just a loser. No I'm not! I just want to be accepted for who I am and not for what I am I can't stand to eat Jester food. It tastes better when I'm already full. It makes me sick sometimes and I have to use the bathroom a lot. How many times do you think I can say a lot without spitting on myself. I like this song it  makes me think of parties, dancing girls. I miss my girlfriend, why can't I be with her. Too bad. Just be strong, If the person reading this actually knew me I wonder what he/she would say? Who cares! I don't care anymore. Just give me an A. Is that what it's all about an "A" we should try to learn something for a change in LOCNAME instead of taking the shortcut approach. My fingers are getting tired. I'm hungry but it's too early to eat dinner What moron decided that dinner should be served at 0:00? If I get my hands on him/her, I would probably do nothing but laugh. Ha Ho Ha. Funny dude, that's me. How many times do I have to keep hitting the repeat button on the CD player. It's pissing me off. I wonder what would happen If our nipples were on our foreheads. I'm a dick for. A lot of people ask what's a dickfor? Funny huh? You probably think I'm sort of a psycho or pervert. Why won't this program automatically return me to the beginning of the document. If I get drunk this weekend I may feel better. probably not. I really miss her. She's got my heart forever. I wonder if this is the way I should feel. Who knows? I can't stand a cold shower. My phone just rang but I cant answer it because I have to do this stupid homework. I hope I don't get demoted for calling it stupid homework. Tired, sleepy. Do you know what time it is. I really miss my sister. She took care of me. She's only 00 though but she's my only true friend. I can count on her to do anything I ask her. Most of the time. Who knows If she gets married to one of my friends, I could be the best man. Who knows a way to type and answer the phone and do this stuff in one motion. I hope a little pause in my typing doesn't hurt my grade. I don't even understand why someone would even spell phone with a ph instead OF an f. My caps accidentally came on change the damn station roommate. He's gone. Black hole sun. Fair-weather friend. Dancing in the woods naked with a beautiful blonde wouldn't be so bad.

__label__label1 Well this is it , I guess?  My first writing assignment in Psychology. I sure hope that no one calls and interrupts my internet access. Watch!  Now that I've said that, someone will probably call. I'm the type of person that thinks that way. I mean, that if I say that I don't want something to happen, then I think that it probably will. The thing is, that those negative things that I think will happen seldom do. I guess I am just a cynical person like that. Wait, is that cynical or pessimistic?  I don't know!  Maybe I just think that way because I think it's humorous, or maybe I'm just trying to keep myself in check. Whatever it is, I just think that way sometimes. Enough about that. There sure are a lot  of fine women here at LOCNAME. Well. Maybe it's because I went to an all boy school for four years that I think that way. No, that's not it. These girls would look good regardless of where I went to high school. The good thing is that there are a lot of girls, the bad thing is that I haven’t met one yet. I have always been shy around girls and going to an all-boy high school didn't help anything. Well, I will say it right here!  I am going to do my best to get over that. With all these girls, I just can't let them pass me by. I see how happy my roommate and friend is with his girlfriend. I also hear countless stories of all these "fine" girls that he has met. I want to be the one with the stories and the girl. Not that I want  my friend to not have the stories and the girl, but I want those things, too. Heartbreaking story:  there is this real "fly" Asian girl in my Chemistry class. On the first day, she sat right next to me!  Then I don't see here for a couple of days. Today I see her, finally!  And she's holding some dude's hand!  Oh well, I guess?!? There's an addiction that I must get over. Not drugs, or alcohol, or anything bad like that. You see, I love to play at the local arcade. I must spend about two dollars every other day in there. My money isn't limitless and everytime I put a quarter into the arcade machine, then that's one less load of laundry that I can do. Now do I want 00 minutes of entertainment or clean clothes. I don't know. It seems that every free moment I have I am in that stupid arcade. A tie-in with the last paragraph: maybe I don't meet any girls because I am in the arcade all the time. Prediction:  I get out of the arcade, I take on an outgoing attitude, and I will meet a girl. Before I finish with this writing assignment, let me tell you about the two addictions that I have that I don't really care to get rid of. I love the Simpsons, and hip-hop. There's something about both of those that I just find pure joy in. In both cases, I see, here, and enjoy things that most people don't. It seems that the more obscure or "hidden" the things that I find enjoyment, the more joy I find in it. I guess it's that I am such a fan of both that the ordinary just isn't quite good enough. That's sort of bad. I should just enjoy the Simpsons and hip-hop for what they are and stop looking for the obscure. Well, this wasn’t so bad. With this  being the first assignment, I guess I'll see you( the psychology web-page) tomorrow . 
__label__label1 Today is September 0, 0000. It is twelve days before my best friend leaves for the ORGNAME. He has come to LOCNAME to visit. I have dreaded these past couple of months ever since I knew he was leaving. He has been my best friend for five years. We have gone through so much stuff during those years. It is hard for me to say good-bye, but I know I must. We said we would see each other in six years but how will we know. it bothers me to know that he will forget about me, but I hope and pray he won't. Ever since he has come to visit we have went out and done something. Usually we just talk. He has been the only person that has understood what I feel. It's like we have some unknown connection that I can't really explain. But I realize that time will go one and maybe in six years we will find each other and things will be  the same as they were be for either of us left. but how will I be certain. I told him that this is the hardest thing for me to do. I don't know if he understands it or not, who knows. It's kind of funny. Everyone believes that best friends (when male and female) make the best couples. And everyone always told us that we will probably get married, I don't think so. There isn't that feeling of that kind of love there. When I came too UT and began to meet other people, I didn't feel that I was loosing him, merely that I didn't think about him so much. But there were times that I missed his companionship when I didn't have someone to talk to. That is what I’m going to really miss the most about him. He has the great capability to listen and help out, even though he is male. But I will always love him and his great personality even if he changes during the years. I believe we have come to far in life as friends to let our friendship fail. September 00, will be a very sad and happy day because he will begin his career and future and I will be missing my best friend in the world. 
__label__label1 I really don't like doing homework. How many hours of my life have been                                                                                                   spent doing homework? I'm sure the  number is unreal. Of course the only time I actually think about mundane things like how many hours I've spent doing homework  is when I'm doing something really boring like. well  homework. Its really warm in my room. I guess I'll have to go down and  get another maintenance request form. There's something seriously wrong with  our air-conditioning which is just not a good thing in LOCNAME, LOCNAME  in the summer. The last time the maintenance man came, he turned the vents down toward the floor. This was his ingenious plan. Great. Needless to  say, that didn't work. So back down to the dorm office I go. Joy of my life. I really wish I was in the mountains. We missed our hiking trip  this summer because we were to busy  showing horses. We went to Canadian  Nationals, but surprise, the horse show was located in the only existing  ugly portion of LOCNAME. Oh well, I'll have to focus on our Christmas  skiing trip and think of the cold snow as I sit in my sweltering room. Well twenty minutes is up. I'm gone.  
__label__label0 welcome to your life, there's no turning back, even while we. we will . whatever. I don't know all the words to everybody wants to rule the world, but that's the song on the radio right now. I can't recall ever hearing a song that I didn't like on ORGNAME. I think that I'll stay in LOCNAME this summer so that I can continue to listen to it. I really missed it last summer, when I didn't really do anything. no, adi can't check his mail. he needs to get his own computer, but then again, so do I. so back to the point, there isn't one, PROPNAME is not impressed with my psychology assignment. he wants to check his mail. that is why he is bitter. he won’t leave me alone to concentrate on my stream of consciousness or however you spell it. PROPNAME is not a man. she is the only girl I've ever met named PROPNAME. PROPNAME will not stop talking about her, I don’t know what his fascination is with her, except that she is very attractive and other things. but that's all I have to say about her, because she is just my very nice friend. I honestly don't care, adi. I’m not lying, I know exactly what my feelings are. adi needs to get the hell out of here. by the way, his real name is aditya, but Americans can't pronounce that. maybe he should go back to LOCNAME. like tonight. I hate the commercials on ORGNAME though. which is why I keep a CD ready for the ten minute commercial times. red shirt PROPNAME, as she's known, was talking about marriage today, I think. that's really scary, since she's only 00, and also because if she marries any one, it should be me. at least for a few days. and PROPNAME hasn’t been around much, but she's kind of out of it anyway. rosy cheeks. PROPNAME has large speakers for his computer. which don't really have any meaning for me, since I never play computer games or do other things with them. I only check my email obsessively, although I usually don't ramble as much, unless I'm emailing my friend PROPNAME, who I tell alot of useless information to. my stream of consciousness is rather boring, as I've learned in past jobs. I've had to entertain myself before while working long hours with no one else around at non engaging tasks. I usually sing whatever song is on my mind until I want to kill myself. (not really-which I should mention since you are psychologists)it's just that these songs get on my mind and won't go away, and all I can do is sing them over and over again. also I sometimes translate them into French. it always seems like I've accomplished something after I've done that. twenty minutes is a long time to just type. at least I have the radio on to give me some sort of stimulation, something to type about. adi has since left the room, which is why what I type is no longer influenced by the things (girls) he is talking about, or rather, about which he is talking. Its hard not to end your sentence with a preposition while typing a stream of consciousness thing, it's also difficult to spell consciousness correctly. I think I need to hear the new Sundays CD, it sounds really good, at least the one song that I've heard from it. I haven't bought a CD in a few weeks now, my last one being an older Poi Dog Pondering CD that I like a lot. my hands are beginning to hurt a little now. fortunately I only have two minutes left. I wonder how many people wrote about how much longer they had left. I know you can type longer, and I'd love to, except I have other homework and my hands hurt in addition to other excuses that I have available. so now I'm going to count to sixty, and that'll be twenty minutes. 00,000. 00,00. 00,00,00,00. that's getting old, although that really was what was going through my mind, only I couldn't really count down and type at the same time, I'll try again with the ten key. 00,000,00,00,00,00,000,00,00,00, no, that takes way too much concentration, but at least now I've exceeded twenty minutes. by one minute. thank you. 
__label__label0 Why am I doing this assignment?  I do not want to be here? I think I want to go to sleep. I wish PROPNAME would shut up so I could do my homework. When I play basketball I wish PROPNAME would pass me the ball. But he never passes the ball so why am I complaining. My wrists hurts because the keyboard is in the wrong position. But I will not say anything because this is not my computer. I hate this keyboard because the keyboard is sorry. I wish I could go to sleep. But then again I never sleep. I wish PROPNAME would get out of this room. Why did I come here?  I wish I stayed in LOCNAME. PROPNAME needs to leave now. But he will never leave because he is going to sit down and talk. Kind of like what he is doing know. I hate this song . They play this song way too much. When are they going to leave. I wish PROPNAME would turn off his computer and stop playing the music. I wish this assignment could be shorter but then again the is homework so it is not supposed to be fun. I wish I brought my own computer but I don't care. PROPNAME needs to shut up. PROPNAME is talking to one of his many girls. He has so many that people call him the mack. The computer is going to be burnt out by the time I am done with this assignment. PROPNAME better leave or I will have to beat him up. Luckily PROPNAME left so I do not have to beat him up. I think my friends listen to more Korean music then I do. God I wish I could get off this computer but I have to stay on here for a while. The reason is because I have to study for my chemistry quiz tomorrow. Hopefully it will be easy because I do not know what is going on in that class. I need to go talk to the chemistry department about switching my chemistry teachers. Hopefully they will let me because I have no clue on what is going on. Today I ate some lunch around eleven o'clock. Yes the food was nasty because it was from Jester. I think they intentionally make the food here disgusting so that we will stop eating and study more. But I don't think so because everybody winds up either working out or playing basketball. I wish they would turn off this music because sound gay. Anyway when is this assignment going to end. I really need to go study for my chemistry class. I just need to type for about ten more minutes. I wonder who this song is by?  Then again why did I care it is stupid. I need to talk to someone but I lost their number so I guess I won't have my blanket. I need to find that guys number but I lost it so I guess I will never find it. I hate HOT I think they are gay . So I do not know why PROPNAME is listening to it. I wish I could take these speakers and just break them because they are so gay. Why doesn’t he listen to some other music that sounds better. I wish I could go back home and drive my car. I miss driving my car. I got a ORGNAME Civic. It is silver and it is all mine. I am thinking about bringing it up next semester. I wish they would turn this music off but then again why do I care. I wish they would play some Tupac or Snoop. I have two more minutes. I wish the two minute would go by faster. I need to get some carpet for my room . I'm thinking about switching my major. I might go to business or I might just stick Psychology and try to go into physical therapy after I finish college. I have one more minute left and then I am done. Toad is stupid. I hate Puff Daddy this song is sop overplayed. 
__label__label1 It is 0:00 in the afternoon. I wonder how long 00 minutes really is and how much I can write. time always seems to go by so slow when I’m bored out of my mind. it's too quiet in this room. usually there's people constantly talking, walking in and out, shouting, banging, or anything to cause distraction. you see, I’m in my cousin frank's room. well, we're not really blood cousins, just cousins by marriage- his aunt married my uncle. anyway, he's pretty cool. I hated him when I was a kid. we were in the same Chinese class and he was one of those really annoying, obnoxious boys that always teased the girls. I guess we're pretty close now. it was pretty scary finding out we were cousins, but its fun calling each other that. ugh. I’m so bored. the only noise I hear is the humming of the a/c which is right above the desk. it's hot, and the a. c. 's not cool enough to keep me comfortable. I’m really paranoid about frank's room. he's a pretty messy guy, and someone just came in here complaining that there were fleas in here. yuck. I hate bugs of any shape and size. all I know is that I’m beginning to feel itchy everywhere. man, it's only 0:00 now. about half way through this writing assignment. laddy PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. I don't know what to write. the more I sit here, the more impatient I get and the more paranoid I am about these bugs around me. frank lives inside an Asian fraternity house. I’m not trying to say Asians are dirty, but sometimes the guys do get a little lazy. I wish they'd clean up a bit. even right after the clean, it's still a mess. it smells moldy, the lighting is really bad, the air is thick, and it just feels nasty walking in here. I hate taking showers or going to the bathroom here. the dim lights are constantly flickering, the seats are a dingy yellow/brown color, and it stinks like shit. and the one stall that's actually half way decent has no lights in it. I basically take a shower in the dark. and the worst part is that I paranoid about guys walking in and out of the bathroom while I’m in there changing. all the guys here know me and respect my boyfriend, but it's just the thought of guys there. yes. it's 0:00. and frank and my friend PROPNAME just got back. they're starting their own racing crew and just picked up stickers for their cars. mmm. and they brought back food. even though I don't like ORGNAME, I always crave it when I smell it. oh well, I’m just gonna eat some since my time's up. yeah! 
__label__label0 Today. Had to turn the music down. Today I went to the KVRX meeting. I  will hopefully have my own radio show. I don’t know what I will talk about. I have considered in great depth and. Jeez this songs starts off quietly. cool beginning. should start louder. oh well can't all be perfect. My roommate is playing the same game . he plays that game too much and spends too much time with it. does he get homework?  I just don't know. This song is rather erotic. in a very deep and disturbing way. I can't decide whether I actually want to study medical technology or not. I love many things form chemistry to mycology to religious studies/. speaking  of which I had a very good time at my PSA meeting. PROPNAME student alliance. ahh. gotta love that screech the chairs let when you push them back. ahhhhh. well. oh yeah at the meeting I met several people. PROPNAME seems rather worried about one of the women. though he is bound and like wise I am unable  to speak ill of her. Well I am in charge of running our booth Monday. or is it Tuesday. That song is one again. his team (my roommate) I s winning. YEESH. Well I guess if he enjoys it. my typing is rather poor and this assignment is taking a long time. 00 minutes. been 0. . lalalalalalalal. Yes the meeting. I talked about shamanism. which apparently comes from a Siberian word. being that there are several hundred different shamanic following in this world. due to the vast number of tribes that speckle our world. PROPNAME PROPNAME has a very sexy voice. I would love to make love to this song,. Well. too much. info. /. Dtos are fun ellipses. that word too is fun. I think that perhaps I am slowly running out of things to say. . That song reminds me of my young age. riding in the car and talking to my  family. the streetlights were bright back then and things were happy. or where they. perhaps not,, I don't remember that well. My car was full of all of us and the  dog wasn't around. She isn't anymore either. epilepsy has taken her from this incarnation. I wonder what she is  doing now. Does she know that I miss her???? I  wish I could find out. Possibly clairvoyance. That is of course under the assumption that spirits are all equal. they are. I know. For I am. Yes I was and shall be. ever. My childhood bears a interesting mark of past fuzziness. I can't seem to recollect exact details like others. very brown. ,. fuzzy is the best word. The 00's really did suck. I wonder why that CD is still lying there on the answering machine. I love bright circling colors. they interest me. not in a psychotic manner but in a very hypnotic manner. they calm. I like to be calm and sedate/. Though activity on occasion is good. . . . PROPNAME is not a good color. neutral  yes but very passive. though passive is good. LOCNAME. there's a philosophy. They believe that by doing nothing they do everything. interesting. I am currently reading PROPNAME PROPNAME His hermetic order seems rather interesting though a bit on the abnormal and almost eccentric side. I remember reading stories about spiders. And milkmen in fields with roses. no daisies. yeah daisies. Looking down upon the daisies as they look up to me. I want to do a past life regression and find out who I was. I wonder if I have been anyone famous or popular. Wow I am saying some rather strange things. interesting. I didn't. . My head hurts. and my room is hot. I would like to stop this. I have 0 minutes left and nothing to say except for watching my fingers press the buttons is a rather enjoyable activity. they press slowly and heavy. sometimes fast and lithe. I mean light. yeah light. so I hope I am doing this right. I am putting my consciousness on record for others to read. I guess that's cool. It should be interesting though I have said very little. I wonder what other are saying. ahh the three minutes have passed and my typing ill now slow to a halt. 
__label__label1 My parents just dropped me off at my dorm room and they are headed home to LOCNAME. They came up for the football game and to see me. My mom calls me every day, whether it be to see if I'm up for school or  if just to see what I'm doing for the day. Gosh, I'm starving right now and my friend just ate all of his ORGNAME ORGNAME. I wish he would have saved some for me. when I get done typing I'm going to go find some grub. Oh, speaking of food, this morning I ate an awesome breakfast buffet at the Double Tree with my parents. I just got a computer; I don't know why I'm using my friend, PROPNAME's, computer. His roommate just  picked up the phone and disconnected me. But, luckily I got right back on. I have so much reading to do today for philosophy, chemistry, and nutrition. I hope it doesn't take too long because I'm so tiered  and I want to take a nap. Every time I wake up from sleeping I feel as though I'm getting more and more sick. I'm on different medications for my asthma, allergies, and my congestion. The good thing is that I have a Doctor's Appt. on Friday. So hopefully I can hang in 'til then. I met a girl that lives down the hall from me named PROPNAME when I moved in my dorm and it turns out that we long lost sisters. Well,  not really, but we do have absolutely everything in common. It really is weird how alike we are. I feel so lazy staying in side studying on a sunny Sunday afternoon. I would love to go swimming right now. I hope that this writing assignment gets to PROPNAME PROPNAME or whomever it is supposed to go to. Well, it's over and I'm off to eat!!  Good-Bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
__label__label0 My love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as I sit here and write this assignment. I don't understand any sLOCNAMEtware but everything for ORGNAME, and the Macintosh is completely foreign to me. I must have already asked at least 00 questions regarding the system, but hey I am new to this whole ORGNAME thing. Apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to ORGNAME and the computer world will be a lot happier. Every time I type the word a lot, I am reminded of my English teacher in 00th grade, or maybe it was 0th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. I'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that I should have written it as two. I think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. I see a lot of people around campus just like that although I remember their faces and words, for the life of me I cannot remember their names, and I would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, Azi, do you remember me?? More than likely I would not, or I would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. I do that a lot. People will have said that they may have called my name 0 or 0 times before I responded by just looking up. My thoughts consume me sometimes. I have a problem with daydreaming. I know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. It is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. I was talking about my thoughts, and how I daydream. Well, lately all I can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man I am to marry. It seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a Freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. I have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. I went to a summer church retreat, and I think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because I met guys for the first time that I could honestly see myself marrying. This has never happened before, and as I glance around the campus, I just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and I am here longing for there company. It is not like I need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. I miss them a whole lot because I have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that I met at this church retreat in LOCNAME. I think I forgot to mention that most of them are dispersed throughout LOCNAME, and I have very little chances of seeing them ever again, unless I actively seek a job to where I can live, go to school, and everything in the wonderful LOCNAME LOCNAME of LOCNAME. All of there pictures, guys and girls from the retreat are plastered on the wall above my desk, and I miss them terribly. I have to go back some day, I haven't enjoyed myself, and have been so completely relaxed as I had in LOCNAME. I know it has nothing really to do with the beaches, although it plays a little  bit of why I would like to go there, and the earthquakes certainly are not the reason I would want to maintain a lifestyle there, it's the people of my religious community. it's a bond, a connection that going to a Baptist church, or a Jewish synagogue embodies. That spirit is completely alive in the people in my religion, just like any religion. It would be ideal if I could just go to school there, get a chance to meet a bunch of people. Get my education, get my education, get my education, finish my education, and I stress this because that is a big part of my life, but I am continually fascinated by marriage, commitment, meeting the man of my dreams, meeting the man of my dreams. It's nothing particularly fancy, or romantic, I am not asking for the PROPNAME and ORGNAME playhouse world with the plastic pink convertible, I just want to get married, start a family, and live my life with all the values, challenges, and commitments it has to offer. I just don't think that I can have that right now, and that is why I spend so much of my time thinking about the endless possibilities of everything having to do with relationships and evaluating my life with and without everything, and just dreaming, night and day about how wonderful and how absolutely dreadful it would be to be married. The challenges are endless in the pursuit of life. And if I may I would like to end with a statement that PROPNAME PROPNAME made after every news statement, perhaps my favorite statement ---and so it goes. 
__label__label1 This is really strange. I have never had to do anything like this assignment in my life. Actually the only time I ever use a computer is to play solitaire. I took a couple of computer classes in high school but never learned anything about the internet. I went after class today to set up the computer account but the office had already shut down. I was able to set up an e-mail address but I just learned that I can't do much with it just yet. I never set up an account with the university so I can't check my mail from the apartment just yet. I came into the computer lab in my apartment complex and fortunately a guy in here kind of helped me to understand what is going on with the computer situation. He let me use his account to do this writing assignment with one restriction-I can't do anything illegal while I am logged into his account. The funny thing is I would not know if I was doing anything illegal because I know nothing about computers. I think before I go to class tomorrow I am going to set up my account at school. Maybe the people in the PROPNAME building will have some handouts for the "computer illiterate". I wonder if I am the first person to do this assignment. Probably not, there was only about 000 people in my class and I am sure someone has done the assignment by now. I figured I should do it ASAP so I won't fall behind in my homework assignments. I was a pretty good student in high school but then again I was always reminded when assignments were due. I already have post-it notes all over my room to remind me of the things I have to do for all my classes. There is a pool right outside of the computer lab I am sitting at and I am thinking I may have to go swimming. I think I will invite some friends over to keep me company. It is really cold in here and my fingers are beginning to freeze up. I am in here alone. The song to "Friends" is playing loudly on the TV in the sitting room next door. A girl who works in the office just shut the door and said "Good Night". It is quieter now and I am beginning to run out of things to type about. I talked to my boyfriend right before I came over here. He goes to Ole Miss in LOCNAME. I haven't talked to him in a few days so it was nice to hear his voice. He has an e-mail address so I think I am going to attempt to e-mail him. I wonder if anyone will read all of this stuff I just wrote. I think with over 0000 entries due it is not too likely someone is going to read this entry. Oh well I have written a little longer than the set amount of time - "Little" being the key word. I am sure with all of the computer technology whoever checks this assignment will know exactly how long I have been typing. I suppose after I set up my account at school I will be able to write my second assignment. I will talk to you then!!  PROPNAME PROPNAME  
__label__label1 I am so pissed right now because I was almost done and then my sweetmate's phone rang and I got disconnected and now I am just hoping that the phone doesn't ring again, I would like to get this done before the weekend begins. I am very excited about this weekend I think that it is going to be alot of fun. We are doing many things, let's see. Tonight we are going to LOCNAME first, which is a religious service (Jewish). Those are always nice,. PROPNAME reminds me of camp which I love. I go to a religious overnight camp in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. In my last letter I was wondering if anyone is even reading this, maybe you are just checking that we did this and that's it. I mean, it has to be incredibly boring to read 000 of these. although, as a psychologist maybe it is totally interesting, you get to analyze all of us. Those surveys well, I thought they were sort of pointless, just because as the teacher said (or you said if you are reading it), the research is meaningless if the patient knows what is being tested. It's not that I knew the hypothesis for all the surveys but they were pretty obvious and I could tell what the researchers were looking for. I like psychology so far though, I don't know if I am going to agree with everything though. I will have to see, but a friend of mine told me that it gets very logical and I am not the biggest supporter of logic. That must sound very stupid, well, that's not exactly what I mean, but I read this book, actually a short story, PROPNAME by PROPNAME PROPNAME, who I love and Teddy said you have to look at the world without logic to understand things better. He said that when PROPNAME bit in the apple, she was really biting into logic. This seems very long, I have been writing for a while I also think I should stop because I am very nervous that the phone 
__label__label1 Every time I get one of these writing assignments my mind always seems to go blank. They tell me "write about what is in your mind". It shouldn't be that hard I mean I am always thinking of something. For example right now I'm thinking I shouldn't have missed breakfast. Anyway this is sort of like writing a letter to a friend where you don't have to worry about grammar and things like that. At least I hope not. I feel like the twenty minutes are never going to be over. Actually I am amazed at how fast I am typing, and I've never taking typing course in my life. Well I think I'm typing fast. I don't know how many words a minute I can type. I hope I do well in school. This place is huge. I am enjoying myself. I've never been on my own before. You can call it a learning experience. There is not much to here with out a car. I hope I get credit for this. I wonder if this one of those things were they try to get into the mind of LOCNAME's youth. They probably didn't get much out of me, since I don't seem to be thinking anything interesting. Maybe I don't know to type all that well. Some people just sit down and all you here are them hitting the keys. I wish I was like that, I could finish my assignments quicker. I need to take a typing course. I also need toenail clippers. You guys probably don't want to here that, but you asked to write down what I was thinking. I also need a poncho because it looks like it's going to rain. No chance in you guys getting me one? Well the twenty minutes are up. c-ya     
__label__label0 Homework, I hate homework. no it's not that. It's more like I hate the  obligation to be busy that it entails. Why is it that after finishing homework or exercises that you feel so great, but actually starting it is so stressful. Why is it that something that is so helpful is hard to motivate?  One would  think that lazy people would have been weeded out by natural selection by now  and it'd be easier for those left behind to get motivated. But from what I've  seen in the history texts, people aren't only not more motivated, they're less!! So if this goes on, it'll get harder and harder for people to get things done. And I'm already having enough problems as it is!   It makes me wonder if the human  race will survive to see a true 'space age'?  I mean, We've made so much  progress in that area already, but at the rate that apathy and disinterest that  sweeping through the population, it's quite possible that we'll never get off of our own little mudball in order to see what the other little mudballs circling a bunch of burning hydrogen look like. Not only that, but what about all these  alien theory's?  There is a truism (called that 'cause they're normally true)  that says, "There is a seed of truth even in the most outrageous rumor"  So I  want to know what that seed of truth is!!  What, or who, is out there. If it's nothing, I want to find out. So maybe in my lifetime there will not be any  answers, but from heaven or hell or wherever I go, if indeed I go anywhere other than the ground, I want someone to somewhere figure out the answer!  Or that  there is not an answer. Oh, well. I think my twenty minutes are up. So  hopefully what little motivation I've mustered will result in more than just a  good grade (although that's good too!) 
__label__label1 Well I really do have alot I should be doing right now but I thought I would get this out of the way and I want to do it early because I am paranoid it won't get sent by some freak accident. Anyway I really need to get stuff done. I need tp study for French even though it's a French I test and I've been in French for 0 years so hopefully I will do o. k. Some guy just tried to chat with me but I told him I was busy and now I feel kinda bad. Oh well he'll get over it. People in LOCNAME really do try to chat with other people in LOCNAME alot. The only people that try to talk to me are online. Maybe it's because I intimidate people. I'm 0 feet tall. I like it though because most guys find it really attractive. My boyfriend loves it. He lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME so it really doesn't matter anyway. I really love him. I met him LOCNAME In May after graduation and he has called me just about every night since. He's even coming down here next month to see me. I really miss him. He really can't even afford to come down because he works in a casino in LOCNAME LOCNAME. That actually kinda bothers me. He's 00 years old. He really needs some ambition. That's something I really admire in people. I've got alot myself. I hope to be a producer someday and live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm already ready to graduate. I miss my friends from home. Hopefully I can see PROPNAME in 0 weeks. I may go to visit my brother at ORGNAME so hopefully we can hang out. I really feel like people don't understand me. I really wish PROPNAME lived closer. I know he loves me. I went with my roommate to visit her boyfriend at LOCNAME this weekend. It was fun. I just really miss my boyfriend even more now. I really nee to read for ORGNAME right now. I want to read ahead for this week. I just want to get out of here. I just wish I could pack up my bags and move to LOCNAME. I do want an education so I guess I'll stick around here for four years or so. I need to call PROPNAME. I ran into my old boyfriend the other day but I pretended I didn't see him. He is someone I will never get over. He had the most amazing mind. He is going to be very successful one day. I feel like he is out of my league. I know I'm not but he just never really understood me. I hope I see him again this week and maybe I will have the courage to talk to him. 
__label__label1 I’m so uptight about writing this. There is so much on my mind that I do not even know where to start. PROPNAME is trying so hard to get PROPNAME to live with her and it works out great if he does, but I just do not know how it will work. if my sister starts to bother him then he will tell me about it, and by the same token if he bothers her I will be the first to hear it. I do not understand why I am so lazy lately. it took me an hour to just decide to get down here to do this and all of my other classes are the same way. I am so nervous about trying out for spirits and dance team on Wednesday I just do not know if I can do it, it all sounds like fun, but what if ORGNAME and PROPNAME get in and I don't? I am the one who told PROPNAME about it in the first place and I don’t think that it would be fair. I need to get my room clean before mom and dad get home , do some homework, take a nap, read a few chapters for psychology, I’m so glad that I got PROPNAME’s drivers license mailed to he she’s probably going to be pissed off because it took so long but I have just been so busy. I wonder how she’s doing since PROPNAME’s not around/ maybe ill call her later after I have done everything else. . I totally forgot to tell PROPNAME that I got a 00 out of 0 on my very first math quiz. mom should be happy, she'll probably just say it was easy anyway but I’m happy about it and I know PROPNAME will be too. some time soon I need to go to the mec to find out if my Spanish credit is in yet. I cant believe I never would have guessed in a million years that I would be a sophomore in college by the end of my first semester. PROPNAME and I are going to be late to dinner at cricky's tonight if he has to mow so many people's yards, but why am I worried about it they talked an agreed on a certain time then its none of my business. I hope he wont get rid of PROPNAME, I love that cat and if I did not live at home I would take her. maybe PROPNAME and I will get married at the end of this year after all then we wont have to worry about stupid little things like this and rent will be alot easier to pay if there are two of us contributing to the cause. I wonder what our babies are going to be like. I think that all of the boys will be just like him, moody. what will it be like to engaged as sophomores in college, that is if we aren't engaged in a month that would be wonderful I know it would motivate me to work alot harder. 
__label__label0 TOday was an easy day for me since I only had two classes to attend. IN math, I really had a hard time staying awake. I didn’t know if it was because I knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. Either way, I was very tired and at times, I just dozed off. In my ORGNAME class, I had to find information on financial aide. I also had to start a checking account at the credit union. By chance in the corner of my eyes, I could a brochure on financial loans for students. So I picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. Right now I'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on Friday. It's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. I probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. Tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 0 classes to attend. English at 0 in the morning is a killer time for me. I had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. I tries to call TEX many times, but had no luck. Now I have to get used to waking up early every Tuesday and Thursday at about 0:00 in the morning. It's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that I can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 0:00 which is psychology. I really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on Wednesday, I didn't take one and when I attended the class, I had a hard time staying awake. I'm glad that I'm in college now because I feel more independent than at home. My mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. But it gets to a point where I kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which I think is contributed to homesick. I can't wait until thanksgiving when I get to go back and see the family because I really miss my baby brother. I would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. I also miss playing basketball with my 0tenth grade brother. He is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and I hope he makes it. He still thinks he can beat me, but that won’t probably ever be true until I'm about 00 and he's 00. This weekend, I hope to attend the football game with my friends again. I went to the one last week and we blew away ORGNAME by a lot. It was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. A packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment I have ever saw because I have never attended a college football game before. It was quite hot and I was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. I definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. I might even paint my face to show some school spirit. Maybe not. After I finish this assignment, I will have to start working on my English paper which is due next Thursday. I kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before I fully understand the assignment. The good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if I need it. My ORGNAME teacher also mentioned a writing center which I could go to if I have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. I think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. You had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. I guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. The one thing I keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. I may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since ORGNAME's was out of them. Textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. The good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. I think my time is up so that's all I'm going to write. I think I changed the subject like 0 different times but I think that's the purpose of this essay. So, that's all.   
__label__label0 As I am sitting in the computer room at the Castillion, I am thinking of how dull and boring this room is. The walls are a dull gray color and I am all by myself. The chairs are scattered unorderly throughout the room. I am now trying to decide about what I should do for this weekend. I told my parents I was leaving here Thursday night but I now realized I have a sorority function that night and also on Friday. I then thought about leaving Friday afternoon, but that would mean missing the ORGNAME game on Saturday. I also have a sorority field day on Sunday which is not mandatory, so I think I am just going to go home Friday night and miss the game Saturday and also the field day Sunday. My classes this year are overwhelming. I am so swamped with work that I'm worried it will not all get done. When I leave this weekend, I hope to get some studying done considering the Castillion is one big party 00 hours a day and it is very difficult to sleep here. I wish people would take others views in mind and be a little more considerate instead of knocking on your door drunk beyond belief at 0:00am on a Tuesday night. I am going to eat at Subway as soon as I'm finished with this paper because I'm starving and I can't concentrate very well. I have about 0 pages to read in philosophy tonight and about 00 pages in biology. This is such a big difference than in high school when you didn't even have to pick up a book to make an "A" in an honors class. I know that some of my friends are going to have a tough time here at LOCNAME because their parents were so protective over them and now that they are on their own with 0th street so close, they are going to go crazy. Some already have. My roommate here is great. I grew up with her and we get along very well. I am lucky considering there have been several problems with rooming situations in our dorm. The mail situation at this dorm is terrible. My father sent me an overnight package and it didn't arrive until one week later. The food at this dorm is good though. Well my time is now up and I am going to go eat, finally.              
__label__label1 stream of consciousness - well, The first thing that comes to mind is why exactly do I have to do this? I know college is going to be more difficult than high school, but projects like this don't have any meaning to me, honestly. I am wondering what will become of me after my collegiate studies. I want to become a doctor but then again I want to be a musician too. I mean I have been playing the piano, singing, acting, speaking, directing bands, and performing for almost all of my life. I want to continue but a part of me is saying - You need to become a doctor because you love biology, anatomy, and physiology; you can be financially secure if you become a doctor! I want to tell myself don't worry about it and what happens will happen. I don't know what to write about anymore! I'm laughing at myself because whatever I am typing I am literally reading it out loud to myself as I write it. I'm thinking is that normal? Anyway, I'm now listening at the keys of the keyboard and the sound that they make, and I am amazed as just how fast I type without formal or informal training. I then think about how blessed I am to be here in college with the opportunity to follow my dreams, once I figure out which dream is possible or realistic. How do I know that my major is the right one? I mean, I am now a microbiology/pre-med ,major and I don't know if that's my fate. Should I be in the college of fine arts and the school of music attempting to become a vocalist which is my other dream for myself. I am looking at how long I have been typing. Only 00 minutes. The phone just rang and I had to answer it; I hate that happened because I was interested to find out what this paper would end up like if I would write continuously. What am I talking about? Well, anyway, I enjoy music and stage. I like volleyball and am very upset that there aren't any male teams in high school or college that are competitive with other schools. My contacts are bothering me; somehow I have the ability to blink awkwardly and move my contact around so that they feel somewhat more comfortable. well, I was just disturbed for about 00 minutes because one of my friends came over to ask how to install his Ethernet card. But guess what I am almost done . I just have a few more minutes. I don't what to write about. I hope that this class is going to be very beneficial. I hope to learn alot because psychology, esp. the physiological aspects really interest me. I'm wondering whether or not I will get an "A" this semester for PSY 000. Well, I'm done! 
__label__label1 that's no good. I was informed as I entered the room that my friend tom's  girlfriend broke up with him. they were engaged;  I hope he comes  through this ok. he gets depressed sometimes,  and uses poor judgement. wow . . . it just occurred to me the more complex problems I face as I age. there's a  volleyball game going on outside in the jester courtyard (I assume . . . tom's roommate insists that it's a drunken festival of debauchery - I can't see out the window). I find their play loud and distracting, but the courts are there for that  purpose and I have no right to complain. the stereo turned off and I find the only noise in the room to be that of my typing. I like music as I work. it  helps me to concentrate. I find that I’m considerably addicted to sound. when I was younger (and not paying an electric bill) I even needed music to sleep. I listened to my  Beatles record whi0le I cooked dinner tonight. chicken fried steak,  mashed potatoes and abbey road  -  fantastic combination. I found that there's a slight scratch  on "Mr. mustard"  -  those bastards at the record shop are supposed to be honest about the condition of the albums . . . it would be easier had they allowed me to  listen to it before I bought it. what kind of record shop has no turntable?  still, I’m glad to have it - I collect old vinyl from some of my favorite groups . . . certain bands have a different sound and feel on record. I started collecting  when my brother bought me "working man's dead. "  he originally inspired my interest in the grateful dead,  I guess that fits. I have discovered in the past few years  just how, in my younger days, I religiously aspired to be like my brother. he's a great guy . . . I’m glad that he's succeeding in life - we went through some troubling stages together. I miss him when I’m at school. it's been five years since we lived in the same house,  but at school I’m 000 miles away rather than across town. tom's talking on the phone to one of our friends,  PROPNAME,  who goes to school  at LOCNAME. computers are amazing things - my phone bill would be outrageous if I couldn't e-mail my friends who attend school in other states. he's talking about the "break-up" now. this whole situation sucks. 
__label__label0 Stream of Consciousness  Well here I am. I wonder why the professor asked us to do this? I had to do this once before. I can't remember what class it was for. I think it was for English class. I liked my English teacher. I think her name is Mrs. PROPNAME. She was a good teacher. She sounded when she read to us. I'm glad I took that dual credit English class, now I don't have to take English in college. That is one less thing to worry about. I wonder if I turned off the oven? Oh yeah, I did. I can't believe I left the refrigerator open all night. I'm just glad my milk didn't spoil. I just bought it. At least I don't think it spoiled, it tasted pretty good in my cereal this morning. I need to buy more cereal. That new cereal is pretty good. I think those fish sticks upset my stomach. I think next time I'll buy fish fillets. I like fish and fishing. I wonder if there is any place to fish around here. I think lake PROPNAME is close but I'm not sure. Then again it be far. I don't know what to get my girlfriend for her birthday. I think I'll get her a card, some flowers, and take her out to dinner. I really miss her. I hope she goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME next year so she will be closer and I can see her more often. I can't believe I have to go to ACC next semester to take college Algebra. I must have skipped a question and didn't skip it on the answer sheet. I've already taken calculus in high school and I made an A. I can't believe I scored so low on the SAT 0 math part. I wonder if there is any more Kool-Aid left? I think there is grape, get some when I'm done. I'm real thirsty but he said not to stop once you've started. My hand is cramping. I think this callous on my finger is getting bigger. I hope I can figure out how to get my computer to work on the internet. I guess I'll just ask somebody. I hate to ask people things, especially directions. I think I'm done. 
__label__label0 Hello!  I really wish I would have learned to type when I was a kid. I have been using computers since I was like seven, but I was never taught like the proper way to type with like which finger goes on which key so I have always ,made up my own little combination and it is kind of weird. I also have to look at my fingers the whole time. I am really tired. I need to catch up on my sleep but I am staying at a friend's house tonight, so something tells me I won't be getting much sleep tonight. But I get I'll get over it. I totally forgot what I was saying. I guess I am brain dead right now. I am actually feeling a little homesick. Not for high school or any thing, but for the way things used to be back home. I had like 0 close friends that were always there and I could be totally natural in front of them, but here it seems like I have to pt on an act, which is the exact opposite of how I figured it would be. My computer is so stupid!  That is why I have to use my friends computer because I can't do anything but play asteroids on my computer because It is so complicated. I am not thinking of any thing to write about right now. I am totally stuck here with out a thought!  That is really not cool because I still have 00 minutes to go !   I have 0 dogs at home. They are very cute except for one, but I feel bad for her because when she was a kid she was beaten up and when we found her collar was embedded into her neck and her back leg was broken. She's better now, but she freaks out ROUND STRANGERS. she HAS NEVER BITTEN ANYONE, BUT MAYBE SHE WILL. my Dad is so great. He always takes in animals that people drop off in front of our house and he has always been so original. Like a month ago he decided to take up golf and he has never played a day in his life so he goes out and hits golf balls on the runways of our airport and he bought this old nasty golf cart and drives around in it. He is just so cool. There are a few strange guys that keep on walking in the room asking for food. My friends have very odd hall mates. that sounded really stupid,. I don't even know the proper name for some  one who shares a hallway with some one else. I got a really bad hangnail today and I bit it off even though your not supposed to and it hurts like crazy. I wonder if any one ever cusses a lot on this. It's not like my grade would drop if I wrote FUCK in really big letters would it?  I guess not since I just did it. maybe I’ll  do it a gain DAMN I don't know why but that's fun! Maybe it's the lack of sleep talking. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. I hope someone does, but that would be the most boring job in the world I would figure. All you do is read like 0 pages of someone's ramblings, though I am sure some of them are cool. Sorry mine won't be , but I can't think of anything!  Actually, I used to watch PROPNAME at ORGNAME all the time when I was a kid. I had this old black and white TV in my room and I would watch PROPNAME PROPNAME , PROPNAME PROPNAME and Get Smart. That one had to be my favorite, because PROPNAME was so cool! They had the coolest little devices and ways to get ORGNAME . I really wish They still showed it on TV. The Nick at nite channel really sucks. all they show is Petticoat Junction and THAT girl. Not very interesting, if you ask me!  I am really not thinking of any thing to say right now. IOK I am trying to think of something. I feel bad because PROPNAME is trying to sleep and here I am clicking a way on his computer how rude!  I really hated that show Full House, but I always watched it. I'm so glad they took it off the air. It is so odd, sometimes I can instantly do those magic eye things but other times I can't do them at all. Well, my 00 minutes are up. Bye! 
__label__label0 I just got done watching "First Time Felon" staring PROPNAME PROPNAME. I was very moving. I'm cooking stew right now on the stove. I learned how to cook it from my father. He taught me how this summer. Earlier today, I did this writing assignment and after completing it, I pressed clear instead of submit. That sure got me upset. Anyway, I went to class today and the lecture was funny. The phone is ringing right now. The phone is still ringing. There, someone finally picked up the phone. I have a lot of homework do to which are due this week and next week. And in two weeks I'll start having my first set of tests. They all fall on me at once. When I think about it, I don't want to study. But thinking back on last year, studying late nights wasn't really too bad. I kind of enjoy it. It was cool to walk across campus at three in the morning and see the stars out. I remember seeing the comet when it passed by last year. That was a really nice view. I wonder how the stew is doing. Hopefully it will taste as good as my father's. I see the letter that my friend sent me form the county jail. I really miss him. He was like a brother to me. We always looked out for each other. I'm really good friends with his brother too. He is a good church-going person. Faithfully believes in God. Well, I haven't talked to either of them for some time now. Maybe I'll give him a call tomorrow if I have time. My girlfriend paged me, but didn't leave a number down. It was just a message. I really miss her. She is back in LOCNAME. Her birthday is coming up on the 00th and she wants to come up to visit for the weekend. The problem is that I have a test on that day, and some other tests that following week. I wish I could take the tests some other time. Oh, well. That's life for you. My brother landed an internship with ORGNAME, but hasn't started work yet. I wonder when he will start. His future looks bright for him. I can hear the T. V. downstairs. Some cartoon show is playing right now. My roommates are downstairs watching it. I can see my keys from where I'm sitting. They are attached to the Pekkle key chain my girlfriend gave me. Actually I have two key chains. The other one is of PROPNAME. A total stranger gave it to me one day and I've never seen him since. I like to think that it was PROPNAME himself, giving me strength when I needed it the most last year. I was feeling down and out last year. I was sitting by myself in a coffee shop and in comes this man. He walks up to me and gives me the key chain. He tells me that Jesus will never turn his back on me. So every time I look at the key chain, I think of Him and it gives me strength. School is finally underway now. I hope that I do good this year. Anyway, the 00 mins are up. Hopefully I'm doing this right. I know that this isn't even for a grade, but I just worry a lot. Speaking about worrying, I'm worried that my phone bill isn't too high because I've been calling back to LOCNAME everyday. 
__label__label1 I really want to go swimming but I don't want to tell PROPNAME that I don't want to see her dumb brother play in that stupid baseball game. I really want to go home this weekend. I know for a fact that my mom would never let me go well maybe she would let me go out with PROPNAME even after I haven't seen her for a while. Maybe I just don't want to go out with him I think that I feel guilty for some strange reason and I can't get the courage to tell PROPNAME. This air conditioner is really bothering me. It makes so much noise and does not cool very much. I am so hungry. My roommate sucks. I don't know why I'm so mean. Maybe I'm just not used to someone always wanting to know everything I do. Maybe she's just too smart and I feel stupid. I'm really hungry. I don't know how I'm going to get to eat if I go with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wonder if PROPNAME is calling me right at this moment. I wonder how come his dad didn't say goodbye before hanging up. I think I'm  making too much noise typing. I get the feeling that I'm disturbing everyone behind me. I can't believe PROPNAME. She just met this guy today and she already has him in her room. I wonder if her parents know the way she is. I still have one more question to do for Economics and I don't really feel like reading. I learned that I should wait to be told what to read before I stress That stress test PROPNAME and I took was weird. I think that man thought that my life was pretty boring. I bet he thought I was weird. He could right away tell what was bothering PROPNAME. I know that PROPNAME really has PROPNAME thinking about him day and night. He's such a jerk. I can't believe what How could someone treat someone that way. Maybe love is blind. I wonder why people around here are so free. I can't believe that girl I say two days ago. She was wearing next to nothing and felt no shame. I assume she must have felt fresh or something but doesn't she have one bit of self respect for herself. I wonder why the lady behind me just apologized to the girl. I had to turn around for a second. I think that I'm a nosy person. I often catch myself eavesdropping on other people's conversations. During lunch today I listened to two complete conversations. I could not believe the things that people talk about. Why does my roommate have to be so selfish. I think that I want to make everyone healthy. I don't know why but I am so self conscience of the way I look. But I hear that is actually average in girls my age. I went all out on this diet until I lost up to 00 pounds and now I think that I am too skinny. but I say this girl today that was a bit over weight and she was beautiful, then why do I gross myself out when I see my roommate eating horrible and then I see her change and I feel that I have to go workout. She gets offended very easily. I don't even tell her anything about her weight or anything related to that subject anyway and she jumps up and becomes aggravated very quickly. 
__label__label1 My toes are kind of cold, no, they're very cold because this room is always frigid. At least I've got my flannel pants on that are so comfortable!  I love them. I could live in them. My T-shirt isn't too warm, but it's okay. I'm kind of wondering how I'm going to do this for 00 minutes straight. My thoughts kind of wander, but I'm not sure how I can record them for that long. I have a kind of upset feeling in my stomach right now. I think I'm just hungry. The rest of me is very relaxed because of the day I just spent out at LOCNAME LOCNAME, swimming and hiking. I loved the cold water that felt so good after the hot sun beating down on me in the car and during the hikes. The hikes were fun, though, because everything was so clean and clear, and it was fresh and refreshing. I wish my desk went back farther because I feel like the monitor is right in my face and it is too big for me to look at the whole thing. I would like a less-focused perspective on it, but I guess that's a dumb thing to say because it's nice to have a big monitor and it's not such a problem. People down the hall are getting kind of loud. It kind of annoys me when they talk really loud all over the dorm, but I guess it shouldn't because I could always just shut my door and it wouldn't be a problem. Plus, I know that I'm really loud a lot of the time, especially when friends come over and find my guitar, speaking of which, I need to get my guitar out of PROPNAME's trunk so I can practice it because they're so much better than me at playing and if we're going to do music for the Happening, I need to be better. I'm wondering if I'm doing this assignment right. I mean, am I supposed to record what I think and feel right now, or if my mind wanders to tangents should I record that too?  I guess I'll just go with my stream of consciousness, like the assignment says. My fingers are going to get tired of typing. I feel like they are getting worn smooth by my fingers always tapping on them. I guess the real problem is that my fingers are cold so there is a kind of loss of sensation and they don't move so well right now. My fingers always get so cold during the winter, especially. I'm kind of dreading fall for that reason, but I love fall and winter, and I'm actually really excited about it. I wonder if I was reading this if I would think I am a negative person. I mean, the whole thing is about negative stuff: cold toes and fingers and stomach pains and annoying stuff going on around. I'm actually a really happy person, I don't know why I complain so much. I wonder if I do that in everyday conversation, too. I guess I'm kind of whiny, but I catch myself doing it so I stop-plus, people know that I'm not really serious about it, I just like to make noise sometimes. rrOoooh, I like popping my knuckles-there I go trying to be positive-it's funny that that's what I came up with to be positive. I just did it, and it helps them feel so much more movable, which is ironic because it'll probably give me arthritis and keep me from moving them when I get old. Oh well, it's a habit I can't seem to break. On my desk I have pictures of my cousins. They are so cute-the little ones, the older ones are just goofy and funny. I love them. Just looking at them makes me laugh about dumb stuff that we've done. There is also a picture of my little sister making a really silly face into the camera. She's in her bathing suit, wearing goggles and everything. Everybody laughs at that picture, including me. There is also pictures of a church retreat I did called Happening. I love those pictures because that was probably the best week of my life and those people are probably my best friends in the world-except for my family because family has always known me and will always be there. I'm so glad that I'm saved. I used to never use that phrase bc I thought it was cheesy and overzealous, but it's so true. Where would my life be without PROPNAME?  I just don't know. He brings me so much joy that it's overwhelming. I wish I could share that with everyone who has never felt it, but some people don't want to hear it. that's too bad because I know people who need Christ (well, we all do, but I mean people who complain about a void in their life that they don't know how to fill) and they're the ones who I most want to tell about Him, but there is such an attitude in society that you just don't  "preach" to other people, and they would resent it if I tried to tell them. They don't realize that I just want to share-"I know it can do it for you-you've got to know what it did for me. " (song lyrics) but I'm labeled as one who judges-funny thing is that they're the ones who are judging me. My intentions are pure. It's not like I'm on commission-one extra year in Heaven for every person you bring to Christ-I just care about people and the Lord, and I want to serve Him and help them. It's the truth, you know?  If only I could just tap my experience into people so they wouldn't doubt me or think I'm false or that I'm just trying to glorify myself because I'm not. "What do I care about pleasing men?  If I wanted to please men, I would not be a servant of God. " Gal 0:00 That's PROPNAME's favorite verse. Hmmm, I wonder if PROPNAME is back in town yet. He went home for his dad's birthday this weekend. I should call him tonight, and now my 00 minutes are up so I can do that!  wow, that went fast. it's kind of scary how fast that went! 
__label__label1 Is there a reason?  These questions have been filling my mind often lately. When I talk to my friends about it they say that they have the same problem. Is this a problem that every young man encounters?  It kin of scary because maybe I'll never find out. Also, can I ever be satisfied. Whenever I gain something I find my self always wanting more. I am incomplete. I have pushed many limits and yet have found no real answers. Some say a man with out a purpose will drive himself insane. Maybe , a man with all the answers has no purpose.  
__label__label0 this song is really sweet my computer is slow but it's cool it's doing pretty well for me I should start typing next to each other just in case I run out of room. well that's better. hehe. I don't believe PROPNAME did that. actually I'm not sure if I can write that type of stuff on here. it's kind of personal and what if someone reads this. I don't mind if PROPNAME or PROPNAME reads it. but what if it's someone else. never mind about that. start thinking and type what your thinking wenshi. great now I'm talking to myself. that's funny. well. the songs over. what's next. prem is a really sweet guy and I am very lucky to have him. I'm also very lucky to have friends like PROPNAME, phong, thang,julie, janet, sean, and so many more. and especially lucky to have such a mom and dad and three brothers that really care. they take care of me. they do lots for me. wenjen upgraded this computer that I'm using to type. isn't he so nice. what a brother. it's really cold in our room. I feel like I'm talking to someone. and tell them everything about myself. but I don't think that is what stream of consciousness is. I don't know. well I'll just keep typing until time is up. oh yeah. I need to call PROPNAME and ask her if she has an extra cable for our TV in the room. good thing I wrote sentences right next to each other. this assignment would of been really long if I didn't. I know I don't have to worry about spelling and grammar and all but it kind of bothers me. it's not much the grammar and punctuation but spelling and spacing of words. I guess I'm just anal or something. who knows. I think other people like my friends and family know me better than I know myself. geez that shouldn't like that but I think that's how it is. oh well. hmm. what else should I think about. that's weird I'm thinking about what I'm thinking. hehe confusing. I miss my friends from high school that aren't going to UT. I miss my family too. my hometown isn't that far away compared to others but I still miss my friends and family. wow I don't know how others from out of state or even the country do it. it must be hard for them. I'm worried about mommy she's home all by herself. everyone is at a different place. wow. but in October all of us should be together. I can't wait until that day comes. it's going to be so cool. it hasn't been like that for more than a year. my goodness only 00 minutes have passed. I have written a lot in 00 minutes. geez. and 0 more at least. wow. I wish all papers in all my classes would be this easy. I mean it's not easy but easier than other writing assignments. you don't have to worry about spelling, grammar, punctuation, and just about everything else. just need something on paper. what kind of paper is that. I think I'm in paper heaven. hehe. that's like the coolest thing. I wish other teachers would be so generous. what happened to my music. I didn't pick this to be in my file or play list editor to play music continuously. but it's still a good song. I didn't even know it was in the file. that's pretty cool. actually kind of weird. hmm. I wonder how long it's been now. my hands are kind of getting tired and hard and tense from typing all this continuously. it's actually tough to type so much because you are thinking of so much at a time. it would be easier if I could type faster or my thinking would be less. hehe. that's never going to happen. I have been told I think a lot. and my mommy says I have lots of wrinkles under my feet. she says that means you keep everything to yourself. it's true for me. I don't know about others though. I think that's a cool but weird saying or superstition whatever you want to call it. it is funny too. well. what time is it now. let me look real quick. I started when the time said 0:00 and now when I looked it's 0:00. just one minute away from the minimum time. I'll type a little longer so it's not like I stopped right at 00. well the music stopped. you know what I just realized. I did pick all those songs I thought I didn't pick. that's funny. oh well. well. the playlist is out of songs I have to start it again when I'm done typing which should be ok to be now but let me check just in case the minute isn't over. I don't want to cheat and make it 00. 0 minutes. let me see here. it's 0:00. so I've been typing for 00 straight minutes. wow. my right arm is sore. it really hurts. I guess I should stop now. well nice typing for my first writing assignment in psychology. I'll be writing another one soon for the second writing assignment. well see this page later. hehe. 
__label__label0 I love it when things are like that, things have calmed down since I last wrote my entry. I have learned that indeed almost everyone else is feeling frazzled right now also. I had English today at 0 am and really enjoy it, I like my teacher a lot and have a small class, which I like also--more of a high school feel. It is my birthday tom. and I am not excited about it because I have really crazy classes tom. an 0am to 00am which nearly always kills me. All my friends are already talking about where to live next year and I am not sure why. They all say that things fill up so quickly. I got my feelings hurt because my best friend committed to someone else without even checking with me, I guess I had assumed we would live together next year. College is so much money. I feel like at every corner I turn there is another fine or whatever, even meals really add up. I am not working this first semester because my mom wanted me to adjust to college before having a work schedule, I am doing some babysitting though. Kids are my life, I do not know what I would do without them. I was thinking the other day, my dogs back in LOCNAME--do they know I am gone? It made me sad to think they have no clue if I am OK, I am very close to them and it sucks to think they don't understand a move. My phone is ringing but I think I will ignore it, no one seems to call me but maybe that is why, I have gained a lot of weight and I can feel it, I am slower and get more tired quickly. I wonder how it will feel to 00! Almost 00, I feel like just yesterday I was at my 00th birthday party-a slumber party, often times I miss that stage in life, the innocence. a lot of my friends have changed since then and change is good, but I miss my friendships since then, all my friends are so different. Right now my friend PROPNAME is here and she is sitting on my other friend's bed. She is thumbelina, so cute. There is a vacuum going on in the background, I really need to shave my legs. and lay out. My brother called me last night and said hi and he misses me, I miss him also but sometimes I wonder if he misses me driving him around, he is only 00. I want my older brother, who is 00, to have another kid, that would be so exciting for me. He already has two. I am a theta and I really like them. Tonight I am going to get yogurt with my mentor who has the same major as I do, she will give me advice on what to do and stuff for the future. My e mail is broken and I am so sick of my computer company because they do nothing about it. They are so slow. Now my friend has left the room, I feel like I can not say private things while she is in here, she was reading over my shoulder-how awkward, she wants to go eat in the cafeteria, and I am not hungry. I am scared for one of my friend's futures, she failed summer school and is doing bad at ORGNAME and is not trying. she is depressed and stays in bed all day, it worries me. lunch at 00 am? is she crazy, I think the TV show PROPNAME PROPNAME is so dumb and should not be aired, before all the fighting started no one really watched it and now everyone knows what it is because of that, how weird. I love beanie babies, they are so cute, but I do not understand why people pay so much money for them. they are beans in a bag, worth about 0 $ max!!!  I love the summer and am sad it is almost over!  My 00 minutes is up so bye bye. 
__label__label0 All I want to do is sit on my couch and take a nap while sitting in front of the TV. I'm trying really hard to not procrastinate as much as last semester. I usually wait until the last minute to accomplish anything. This was assigned about two weeks ago and I'm just know doing it. I've had plenty of time to do it, but I find myself wanting to plop in front of the TV instead. I love being a couch potato. My mind wonders a lot and people tell me that I'm a daydreamer. Whoever reads this will probably agree that I can't keep my train of thought on one idea for more than two minutes. This weekend I have to go home and see my grandmother who is in ICU because she was in a car wreck. I really hate going to hospitals and seeing how sick everyone there is. It scares me to think of what might happen to me in the future. My mom told me that she probably won't even remember me. I can't decide whether or not to hang out with my friends when I go home this weekend. I know that I will and will not accomplish a lick of homework or reading, but I will still give it a whack and take my books home. I don't know why I even bother lugging them around when I know that they will sit in the corner of my room. My brother and I are not speaking and it's been about two weeks so I kind of miss him. I'm supposed to be in his wedding in November so we better start talking by then. I can't decide what I want to do tonight. I might try staying in for once but that is very unlikely. Even though there isn't really anything terribly exciting going on during the week I still manage to find anything to do but be at home. There actually isn't anything good on TV at 00:00 PM, but I sit in front of the TV anyway. Usually I keep asking myself why I'm watching this stupid show and wonder who in the hell actually thought that shows like "Sister Sister" and "the Smart Guy" were even remotely funny. Why do those shows even stay on?  I don't know a single person that watches or thinks that they are funny. 
__label__label1 Sometimes, I don't understand my ex-Boyfriend. He tends not to tell me everything, especially the ones that he thinks I shouldn't have to worry about. Maybe it's because we didn't have enough time to know more about each other before I left. A lot of times, I sincerely wished I had known him earlier, and things between us could have been lot better. When we were together, I didn't think I would miss him that much even if I came back to LOCNAME. But, somehow, he knew I would miss him. But I really didn't realize how much I miss him until now that I am back here. I couldn't call him nor email him. The only thing I can do to keep in touch with him was write letters. It takes about a month back and forth. And one month is really too long for me. I want to know how he is doing and if he misses me as well. I wish he could come here to see me. But I know it's just my imagination to something that's almost impossible. Even though we never really talk about how we are now since we are so far away from each other, at least, I know that we are still good friends. 
__label__label1 I even went to summer school here in the ORGNAME ORGNAME and I still find myself in amazement sometimes. I am adjusting well-- a greORGNAME deal better than my mom. That could be because college is something I knew I had to do and the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME at ORGNAME has always been the place I wanted to be. My classes are okay. I have a sort of messed up schedule. I really cannot complain. Tuesdays are the only days that totally messes with my mind. I cannot seem to get signed up for a research experiment in LOCNAME. I have went by a numerous amount of times. I like to get things done ahead of time. I am just now doing this because the lab is always full. I am too lazy to go to the one at my apartment complex and when I came to the lab yesterday I totally messed up on the waiting list procedure. When it asked for your name, I put in my name instead of my if account. so I couldn't log in and it assigned my computer to someone else. When I used the lab over the summer I never had to get on a waiting list, so I did not know. I did get quite embarrassed though. I did it right today. But I guess I did not anticipate doing so, I did not bring a disk. As far as I can tell though I don't need one to complete this assignment. so let's see, school is doing fine. I am having roommate trouble a little bit. I live off-campus and I have 0 roommates. Well, 0 of us get along fine. But one attends ORGNAME and she is 00 years old (boy, does she act it). Well, that is the only thing that is bothering me. I am stuck with her for a year. She lied to get in our apartment and now we are stuck with her. Oh well. In my Philosophy class, which I just left by the way, Professor martinich is so interesting. He wrote two of our textbooks. He' s real perceptive and insightful. I am taking Philosophy of Religion. There are about 000-000 people in the class, so we have ORGNAME ORGNAME. I hate my SI. We are supposed to discuss and we actually get graded for it. But, I don't fell comfortable doing so. I love to talk and I have plenty of opinions, so that's bothering me. The only thing I can come up with is that when talking about a thing like religion everyone comes into the discussion with strong opinions. Like last week, we basically argued. I made a comment and they looked at me like," Boy is she stupid. "  I don't  like that. Even the TA acts like he has his own views and those that are against the grain aren't worth listening to. He questions your comment and accepts others. I don't  know. I am thinking about talking to Dr. PROPNAME. I guess I'll give it one more try. that was just the first one. I shouldn't get counted off for being in an uncomfortable environment. 
__label__label0 I know there's nothing "wrong" I can write, but I still feel like whatever I'm writing may not be what they had in mind. It's about 00:00, and I am starving. As soon as I finish this I'll get to go and eat. I just came back from calculus, which is at least a 00 minute walk away from where I am (which is Dobie). I don't think I'm going to learn too much from the professor I have for calculus. He doesn't ever explain what the hell he's trying to do, and, like today when this guy tried to ask him, he almost yelled at him for jumping ahead. It is really frustrating because he first says something and then writes it down verbatim, and it makes me really mad. He wastes so much class time writing down the obvious even after he's said it ten times. I tried taking notes, but I doubt they'll help. I have always loved math, but this is just frustrating. My friend PROPNAME (who also lives here nad is from my tiny hometown) has a suitemate named PROPNAME, who had him last year. She said it's horrible. SLhe only knew two people who got an A in his class. She was telling me about how he writes down every little thing, and now I see what she means. She also said his tests are nothing like the homework, so I don't know what to expect. I am so hungry right now. I didn't eat too much this morning, because I never seeem to be hungry when I first wake up. My roommate is really sick. Ithink she has strep throat. Which means it'll only be a matter of daysbefore I get it too. My immune system has never been that good. I know, I know, I never really exercised that much, but I never seem tok have too much energy. My mom always thought I was anemic, but tests show I'm supposedly not. It's so weird how whenever I walk around campus I keep seeing people I know. Well, not really know, but I recognize them from camptexas or orientation or somewhere like that. I usually don't get to know too many people from placeslike that because I tend to be a little on the shy side. People always toldm e I'd outgrow that, but, well, I'm still waiting. In fact if there's onet hing I could change about me, ti'd probably be that. Everyone says you can make yourself  not be shy, but I'm sorry, I don't know how. I've tried and tried, but to no avail. When I'm around a lot of people I know, it's not too bad. Like in high school, I knew everyone in school (it's a small school and we've allb een together since kindergarten) and it was never too bad. I didn't love public speaking or anything where a lot of attention was directly on me, but I was always pretty comfortbale around everyone. But here I feel kind of lonely. My cousin, ORGNAME, who is a sophomore here, says it was that way for him lst year. I can't even reach one of my older friends here. I don't know what the problem is. And my other friend I called never called back. I don't know if she just didn't get the message, or if she's not calling back because she doesn't want to. My friend PROPNAME and I spend a lot of time together (we eat together and stuff) but she's already separating form me a little bit. At least we're going to the football game together. I'm looking forward to the game. I miss football. I never eallly appreciated it until I played powder puff last year. I somehow always feel like I'm overlooked because I'm quiet. At lest I hope it's because I'm quiet, and not just because I'm easy to overlook. I'm the youngest in my family, and whenever my older brother would be talking to my mom, she would always listen to him and ignore me, no matter what I was saying, until he left the room. Honestly, they thought because I am younger that whatever I say can't possible be as important as what he's saying. I could be telling her the house is one fire while he was telling her how he drove to town, and she wouldn't listen. Don't get me wrong, she has always been a great mom, but that has always bothered me, maybe more than it shoyuld. I don't really believe in those horoscope things, but sometimes when I have read them (at the end of theday) some eerie things ahave been true. Anyway, I read one of them on the ocmptuer. First of all, I have never been a "typical" sagittarius, like the magazines and articles say. They say they're all outgoing, and at times I am painfully shy nad introverted. Well, the one I read on the computer said the way to most hurt my feelings was to ignore me. And, that's true. If one of my friends is a total asshole to me, I will usual forgive them if they will just pay some attentin to me. I don't' think I have too many people in my life that I can count on, and that's really what I need most. I don't know if there's anyway I can fix that, but it's been a long 00 years. This probalby sounds like I'm a manic depressive, but before you call the authorities, let me assure you I'm not. I just don't have very high self esteem at times, and I often feel like I'm all alone in the world. I ahve a fear that I'll never find anyone to love me (like a husband). I don't see how someof  these other people manage to meet tons of guys, while I'm always alone. And most of those girls don't even appreciate them, and I know I would. Maybe it's back to the shyness thing. I really don't know, but I wish whoever did wuold tell me. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I was hoping my classes this smester would help, but I don't know. Part of me wants to go into business, but by the time I get accepted into the business school, I may change my mind again. I'm in the natural sciences thing as an undeclared pre-med right now, but who knows howl ong that will last?  I'm not lazy, but it takes me a hwile to get readjusted into going back to school. And even though I was in two ap classes my senior year and I graduated valedictorian by a long shot, I never had to work TOO hard in school. This stuff just came naturally to me. 
__label__label1 Very rarely do I  just sit down in front of a blank screen and start writing without having any idea where my words are going. At this point, I'm really wishing that I could get some peace and quiet. I've always lived in an extremely quiet house and I guess I took the peacefulness for granted. However, despite the occasional clash between my study and the party in my room, I have no complaints about the present state of my life. I'm heading home this weekend, and while I've only been in LOCNAME for about two weeks, I feel like this is home now. My house is just like some place I visit on occasion. I can't decide whether its a good thing that this change in my life doesn't bother me or whether its a bad thing. Either way. what are you going to do. I am just completely blanking on what to write about. Anything that is running through my mind would take too long to explain and I don't usually tell stories about myself anyway. For an arbitrary subject, I guess I'll write about my best friend. She goes to ORGNAME and I will be seeing her in about a week for her sister's wedding. It seems strange to be her without her. We talked everyday in highschool. Four years. that's a long time. However, I don't feel like our relationship has suffered at all because of the distance. I always believed that once you got to see what is inside the center the someone, what makes them tick, what makes them unique, then the relationship never ends. Because, what is inside someone never changes. All of the stuff we put on for show, that changes, but not what's inside people. I am looking forward to the wedding though, because it feels like I haven't seen her in a long time.    O. K. Second arbitrary topic. Dating. I am really looking forward to dating  in college. I mean there are about 00000 new girls wandering around here, and at least some of them are bound to be interesting. However, it is a bit strange to think about dating because its only about month since I broke up with my last highschool girlfriend. Damn, it is so hot in this room. Well, my ex-girlfriend. that subject is going no where. I guess I have a tough time talking about the past. I always figured that everyone distorts there versions of the past. Memories are either viewed through rose-colored glasses or blinders. I'd rather think about what I'm doing right now. Memories are nice on occasion, but as with anything else, you can over-indulge in them. What's really foremost in my mind right now is making good grades and not losing my social life or mind in the process. I really don't think that will be too difficult though. When you study something you enjoy, then its not really work. Instead of draining your energy, it gives you more energy. New things to learn, new things to strive for. I love it. I really have no clue how long I've been writing, but I assume I'm pretty close to 00 minutes. Mental note to self:  pick up new PROPNAME PROPNAME CD for dad tomorrow and call PROPNAME. Well, this is my stream of consciousness. Its not a deep stream but damn it its mine. To end I will remind myself of some sayings a very wise man said once:  Never play poker with a man named PROPNAME. Never eat at a place called PROPNAME's. Never date a woman with a tattoo of a dagger anywhere on her body. Never try to teach a pig to sing. it stresses you out and annoys the pig, and finally, the ultimate truth in the universe:  frogs have and always will whomp their asses every time they jump. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Be sure to tip your waitress. Good Night!      
__label__label1 I am happy that I made the transition from ORGNAME ORGNAME to ORGNAME. I am cautious about my future and what I want to get involved in. I want to become a Texas Wrangler but I am unsure that they will take me. I want to do well in school and get in to law school. I don't study as much as I want to, and I need to work on that. I love sports and I like football most of all. I wish I had played football was a kid. I am excited about the future of our country and I want to get involved. I don't understand what this assignment is about, but I will write everything that is on my mind. I worry a lot about stuff that is of no concern to me. I try to be the best student and person that I can be. I have a lot of pressure on me from my past and the way I have been raised. I've always been a good student and pretty athletic, and I try to be the best at everything. I knew that is bad, but I feel that that is the way I was born. I believe our President is guilty and should be impeached for the good of the nation. He is a smart man, but he is personally corrupt. I have a roommate that is good. He is Norwegian and is a great student. He is fun to hang out with and we get along well. I have a girlfriend and I'm not sure if we should stay together. We get along well, but I feel like I have the whole world at my fingertips, and she is holding me down. ,  WE share a lot together and we are best friends, but she wants more. more time, more money. etc. My parents are strong Christians, but ?I am not sure that that is what I want. College is a time to figure all of this out, and I am glad I am here. It is a fun place and the knowledge here is overwhelming. I am like a sponge trying to get it all in my head. I want to be an attorney and I feel like al the knowledge will make me a better lawyer. I want to be the best that I can be and make a good future for myself. My Mom never went to college so she wants me to make the most of it. It is a lot of pressure from her, and I try to be a role model for my younger brother. He is a trouble maker, and I want to be a positive influence in his life. He is a good kid, but the friends he is with are not good for him. I love my family very much. I can't wait for the UT ORGNAME football game. I love the game and I love the school spirit it provides. I was an engineering major at ORGNAME ORGNAME last year and I made the switch to UT all by myself. I am proud of that move, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It was the best move I've ever made. I like the big school here and the number of students here. I want to run for public office when I get older and make this country a better place. I feel like I can be a good leader and bring good things to this country. I am a good person, and I believe others will think so too.  
__label__label1 at this point I am very unsure of what exactly to do or where my direction for the future is. My paranoia that I developed from living in ny has certainly overcome my life as everyday is almost a struggle at times to go on because I so easily find something to mess it up. I feel as if everything is always ready to go wrong, so I guess I need a more optimistic view of my life so I don't have to have negative beliefs everyday that ruin a perfect day.  I guess I am also questioning whether I belong in LOCNAME or if I should return to LOCNAME and transfer to nyu business school. I will need a 0. 0 both semesters which will be close to impossible for myself in order to stay here. in addition I also wonder if I belong here and if I can fit in with everyone else. they are all nice to me but I just wonder if I can fit in and if they are all being fake to me behind my back, not that I don't already have to deal with that in ny. if it were not for people I could trust like PROPNAME or PROPNAME or a very few others than I don't think I could make it here. I am very surprised to find how certain people have just drifted away and its like I make an effort and they don't even care about it. I just feel that sometimes things are not any better here than in ny and if it came down to the two I would probably just go back to NYC.   NYC has a very special importance to me. I feel in a weird way that I can fit in there and it is my real home. to have the opportunity to live there for college and party all the time is really exciting, although I wonder if it would be the right choice to go back east since I was so miserable there. PROPNAME is the only person who I can count on and maybe even PROPNAME if I was not so pissed at her for going out with mike, but then again maybe that is my fault. if I wasn't so flirty and actually expressed my feelings than maybe it could have worked a lot better, but then again I always find someway to screw things up as usual which always haunts me at every task or thing now because I go in with such a negative attitude all the time. hopefully I can have another positive year like last time and it will help me be more confident. In the mean time I really need to focus on new goals and establish myself more positively:       0. get a 0. 0 average so I have the opportunity to stay if I want to but keep all transfers in mind especially nyu or something in the LOCNAME area in case I feel the need to leave.    0. keep working out and getting big - competition is tough and I have to compete with you know who so I feel as if I must keep on going and hopefully it will work and I will look decent for once in my life - I also need to stay healthy and I need, I want a 0 pack by years end if it kills me      0. work on being social despite my physical problems and hopefully I will win out with whatever way it goes      0. help your community out and help others - remember you have been bad and need to fulfill certain things because the lord put me here for a reason and I want to be helpful and give happiness to others since I am not happy at least     Remember to keep it real and tight  . CAN'T NOBODY HOLD ME DOWN!!!!  I CAN'T STOP! I WON'T STOP! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO STOP!   ) 
__label__label1 The reason being is because I am in good health, I do not have problems studying in my classes, and I have now set a routine where I can exercise, study and have fun at the same time. I do have long days on my classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, but when I get through them I recover on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Last year I was not as fortunate with my schedule and my health. I had problems that required I go to a doctor and have x-rays done as well as other tests. Many of the friends of my family also passed away during that year and I was also trying to get myself used to the transition from highschool to college while taking some pretty difficult courses. Overall, I was having a tough time adjusting. I had to miss several classes in order to go in and check what my health problems were. I sometimes even had problems walking at U. T. because of the pains I would feel and did not always fully concentrate on what I needed to. I also seemed to have more distractions my freshmen year and did not always study like I should have. I still made pretty decent grades but I feel I could have done better. Compared to then, life is good. My emotions are better intact, I do not get as nervous as I used to be, and I do not get embarrassed easily to answer questions in class like I used to. I also seem to tolerate more in terms of the differences in people. I still want people to know that I consider God to be important even though they may not. Some people used to tell me that I would change as soon as I entered college and would become like everybody else. I haven't and I want people to understand that even though I may be alone in a lot of issues, I will stand alone and not follow what I don't believe to be true. Sometimes I do not appreciate the fact that some professors don't really care about those in the class who regard God as important and ridicule every person who may believe in that way. I feel sometimes that as a student respects a professor in some of their opinions, then a professor should also respect the student likewise. I do, however, express my feelings to the professor if I feel they are not correctly handling the situation. I do hope the professor does not feel it is an attack on my part and I try to get my points across as diplomatically as I can. With most that I have talked to, I get a pretty good response and we are able to work things out. I do have strong feelings but I hope I do not have to express them in a way that nobody wants to hear. I'm willing to work things out, and I hope that the other individual involved would be the same. 
__label__label0 I am thinking about my roommate who got the wrong book for his Japanese class and didn't realize it till he tried to do his homework last night, he had to get up this morning and drive to get the book and try to do the four pages in the book that were assigned for homework before class started. He is crazy, he and I always get into trouble like that. We've known each other since elementary school and have had some great times. One time I remember we were studying for a chemistry test our sophomore year in high school, it was really late so we decided to go to the store and get some jolt cola to help us stay awake. I ended up backing my truck into the ditch in front of the store and we were stuck. We sat there forever trying to get my truck out of the ditch and then finally I called another one of my friends who had a four runner. He took us to ORGNAME and we bought a tow strap. We  went back to the ditch and hooked our two cars up together. He then tried to pull my truck out and his tires just spun around and around. So I had to accelerate and my roommate had to push my truck from behind, by the time we got my truck out of the ditch it was like 0 so we were way to tired to study, so we  went to bed and failed the chemistry test. I ended getting a 00. 0 in chemistry and being moved to the academic class because of 0/00 of a point. If it was for  my roommate coming up with the great idea of going to get jolt cola in the middle of the night I might have been able to stay in chemistry honors, but even if that was the case I would much rather have that memory than an extra point on my high school gpa. My roommate and I now live in a two story townhouse that is 0000 square feet. We got a really good deal on it because the week before school started the apartment complex we preleased with called and said that had no apartments left for us even though we preleased 0 months ago. We had to drive to LOCNAME and look for  a new place that weekend and while we were here we stopped by the leasing office and talked to the people there, they said that someone cancelled on a townhouse and that since we had to go through all this trouble we could have it for almost the same price we were going to pay for and apartment about 0/0 the size. We got so excited and I am really glad things worked out like they did because I don't think I could live in a small apartment cause I need  a lot of space or I go crazy too much space makes me crazy too but only when there is no one to share it with. But our townhouse is just the right size and its nicely furnished because both of my parents have been  divorced and remarried so there is a lot of furniture that no one uses, so I got some pretty nice stuff. There aren't many decorations in the townhouse but there are lots of dishes and silverware. I took my stepmom's couches which really surprised me because I didn't think that she would let me have them because sometimes she is strange but I guess she can be pretty understanding sometimes. I used to hate her but now I realize that she really does want the best for me and only gets frustrated cause she raised her kids differently than my dad raised me. 
__label__label1 Although, I constantly advocate to my friends that one should make the best of everything, I failed to do so. Recently, I have noticed a drastic change in my life. Prior to the major transition of my life (college), I used to constantly worry. worry. worry. Although I still worry, I have learned to view life from another perspective. Each and every minute I must be productive, but no longer is my school work the only "productive" thing in my life. I realized that simply chatting with some friends or relaxing can result into a more elaborate learning experience then simply books. For instance, I was watching a movie last night (something I rarely do because I feel I am not being productive) that enhanced my knowledge of the world around me. Very few movies make me think long after I finished watching the movie, but this one did. The overall design and structure of the movie was not to great, but the plot behind the movie sparked some circuits and made me question particular aspects of life. All in all, I am trying to stress that I am still learning regardless of what I do. This certain attitude towards life has allowed me to be open-minded and not as stressed out as usual. Today, I have several things to do. My priority list is very long, but I am limited with time. It seems the more I think about how much I have to do, the less time I have to do it. I have two tests next week. Chemistry and Calculus, respectively. My weekend is going to be centered around studying for those two tests. Hopefully, my mind will allow me to concentrate on those two tests and only those two tests. Austin, or rather LOCNAME, is a very convenient campus. Opposed to my hometown, LOCNAME allows me to travel many places on foot or even by bus. This form of transportation is very tempting!  I just bought a laptop which I am very excited about. I felt rushed when I bought it, but it is too late now. I still have to buy a PC card for it so I can access the internet from my dorm. I want to designate a weekend to upgrading and buying software for my computer, but I have so many things on my mind. By the time I get around to doing so, a whole new line of computers will be on the market!!!  My life is busy, hectic, stressful, etc. But, I enjoy it!  I am confused on what organizations I should join here at LOCNAME. I am used to being a part of and active in nearly everything I am offered. Here at UT, I am unaware of everything they have to offer and therefore, not a participant in everything I want to join. I hope that I will gradually reach the peak I was at in high school. I am sure I will. I was  unaware of my surroundings a minute ago and this man was asking me a question. whoops. I believe I have reached my goal now, after reading the assignment nearly 00 times.     
__label__label0 god I can still remember it. the last time we did that was at our graduation party. one of our friends that night was a real bitch. the party even though their were 0 of us had to have it her way. but she is going to live ion LOCNAME for the rest of her life and  of course the next time I will see her is when she is taking my fast food order  I am so happy to be here the guys are a big improvement from where I'm am from  tall and cute a real McAllen novelty. oh and the cafeteria guy is the best so far. this Friday I have instillation for apo. I hope I have a good guide. the person I liked left this week my friend still has her guy I had a good time at the football game although I had to relearn all the cheers I had a great time  I finally got my disco ball to work I would love to put on some relaxing music and turn it on  I could really use some me time right now I would love to have more than 00 minutes free at a time and more that twice in one day. of track roommate is here so the topic is toes my feet are retarded the littlest toe kind of curls under good the air just clicked on I really hope to have a good time this weekend I hope their is another party I had a great time this past weekend. the parties were a lot of fun is time up yet god I hate ok don't hate it but dislike it its playing right now and boy does it all sound the same only eight minutes left I wonder how my brother is its his first year in high school he didn't even get any of my teachers,  he never does I hoped they would give him a hard time but no luck I am so tired yawn dinner was good haven't had micky d's in a while I tried not to eat today but finally had to take out the time to eat tomorrow should not be that long of a day I am going to relax and watch TV I need to go to ORGNAME and get foot things for my shoes yawn I hope someday I get to check my mail soon we still have no either net god two weeks and nothing just trying to make time to do this  is a big problem without a working computer. I hope I get to see the cute guy tomorrow I hope I don't fall asleep in arch and society two more minutes left my poor friend got grabbed by a guy today and I am proud to say she broke 
__label__label1 So much needs to be done within the next two days, it seems practically impossible to get it done. I have to write these two essays, redo the entire freaking' pretesting crap just because I completed 00% of it and then when it kicked me off, it didn't even save it although I was informed otherwise. So, frankly, I'm disturbed by a lot of things. I have a journalism test tomorrow morning, which, by the way, I haven't studied for, and tonight I had a presentation for ORGNAME, a service organization I would like to join if, in the midst of all this chaos called "college", I can somehow find the time for a decent social life. So this "stream of conscience" theory is going to be more of a "PROPNAME needs to vent" period, because frankly, that is all that is on my mind. I had a crappy day, and I don't expect writing this will help me all that much, but I'll go ahead and say what happened. Some egotistical freak from the male species grabbed my ass today while I was one of the many cross walks on this large campus. Granted I hyper-extended is wrest, at worst I broke it, I would like to request respect from the gender that so frequently asks the inevitable question "why"  when the finger always points to them!!  It was freaking' hot outside all day, and running from class to class always makes it oh so much cooler!!  And the whole idea of college is running through me now when I have deadlines for tests, papers, and self-indulgent pompous professors who think they know the answer to the world, and what's even scarier than that is that WE pay to wake up at 0 AM to go to their lectures and believe the handfuls of bullshit they try to feed us. (I was making a generalization about the professor part of course, some lectures are actually stimulating. )  To top it off, somewhere in the midst of all of this mumbling jumble of chaotic words, I feel almost depressed tonight. I met a guy at the ORGNAME organization meeting mentioned before, and I REALLY like him, and I heard that he was interested, but I haven't seen him in six days, and I honestly think that he could actually calm me from this feeling of intense pressure. If I could just see him I would relax and then take a different view on all the crap that I still have to do. I guess I just need him right now, and the longer I go before I see him again, the more distant and hopeless I feel toward him. I guess you can say I've been lulled into inertia by my subconscience feelings to see him. Anyway, my twenty minutes of rambling has come to an end, so it was great venting and I hope, in some weird way, this has satisfied your requirements and calmed your thoughts and revelations about the stream of conscience in a frustrated, tired, and ticked off college student. 
__label__label1 it cuts into my social time and I hate that I can't do some things because I have to get ready for my classes the next day. I enjoy college that much. well I enjoy the social aspects and the fact that I can meet all kinds of new and interesting people, but I am so sick of school and the first week isn't even over yet. that is very sad. I wonder if everyone is this way. well at least I am trying to get a head start on all the psychology requirements. if I get them out of the way immediately then I don't have to worry about them at the end of the semester when I need to be worrying about my other finals. I am very grateful that we don't have a final in this psychology course. psychology is very interesting to me. I don't think I could pursue a career in it though. I just think it is neat to study what people are thinking and why they are thinking things. I think I can handle the class. think I can handle everything this semester. I just hope that I don't get too homesick and that I get along well with everyone. I can't wait to see PROPNAME my childhood friend. he is so smart. he is fixing to start working on his phd in pharmacology. he hasn't always been this smart. when he got into high school his brain started to kick in gear I guess. ever since then he has made straight A's and has been the class genius. I guess what he needed was a boost of self confidence. his brother on the other hand needs confidence and motivation more than anyone I know. he irritates me sometimes because everyone has to go to him and he won't go do anything without people forcing him to go. I love him though. it is funny how someone can irritate you to death but because you've known him forever you have to accept his faults and still  love him. it is funny how people are so impressed with money and the people that have a lot of it. if you had a bunch of money you could have instant friends. it drives me crazy that people don't look at the person but what the person  has. you end up worse for it because that person that has all the money  just ends up annoying everyone else. anyway there are some people out there that aren't like that and don't go crazy over someone because they have a lot of money. that is one thing I have learned that you can't stereotype people at all because there are always exceptions to the rules. well my twenty minutes up and it went by real fast. it is funny how fast time goes by when your mind is preoccupied or you are having fun. I think it is neat. 
__label__label0 I don't really know what I should write about. I guess I'm feeling alright. My class was cancelled for today so I had the whole day off. I rented Sling Blade which I liked the movie had people with psychological problems like the guy who is always talking about women he killed and the main character who cuts peoples heads open every once in a while if he feel s it is necessary. The keyboard on the computer sucks since the space bar key keeps on sticking whenever I try to push it down. I am kind of nervous about classes because last semester I screwed up grade wise after keeping an almost 0. 0 ORGNAME for 0 and 0/0 semesters. I have never taken psychology before in high school and I wish I had since it would make the class easier now when I take it. I really can't type continuously for twenty minutes without having a definite subject so I keep having to stop and think of something to type. One of my goals this semester is to stop watching TV so often because that is what I feel screwed me up last semester since I was always staring at the screen either their or while surfing the web. Now I beginning to feel a little grossed out because I was just thinking about our dorm meeting where they told us housekeeping comes in only every other day to clean the bathroom when they used to come every day and it was still pretty dirty now it is going to be even worse. I guess it has been about twenty minutes now I forgot what time I started typing at since I forgot to write it down I thought I would have remembered. So I'm just going to call it a night. 
__label__label1 I don't have to follow any rules except for the ones thORGNAME I create for myself. As the days have gone by I have slowly but surely felt that I am alone. Not being without my family has created feelings ORGNAME sadness inside. I know that all of this is just part of life and a certain period of adjustment that everyone in life must go through. I have done some crying and soul searching alone in my dorm room. I am expecting that my time in college will put me to the test and show me my weaknesses and strengths. I have been forced to come to terms with the fact that I am now the only one responsible for my well-being, time management, and academic matters. I must now assume total responsibility for myself. However I know that my family is always here for me as far as moral support is concerned and when I am in need of more money!  rrHaHa!  I am really feeling excited about being in LOCNAME because I am closer to my sister in LOCNAME LOCNAME and there is a wide variety of people here to interact with. I love to walk down the streets and see everyone, what they are wearing, how they are acting, and all around just what is going on. I consider myself to be someone who is open to people and their different lifestyles. LOCNAME, the town that I am from, has the population at LOCNAME and it is a rather conservative place. If some of the people in LOCNAME were to go down to LOCNAME and walk the streets, they would get stares and be talked about. I love the fact that in ORGNAME all things go. Going to class was somewhat of a nervous experience for me because I did not know what to expect. I found out that it was somewhat like the high school class experience, except for the fact that there were now hundreds of people in my classes. Also, I don't have to go to class if I don't want to. Although I could not see that as a possibility because I feel if I do that, then I will fall behind and lose valuable information. I feel really stressed because things have seemed to be going wrong for me since I got here. I have been misplacing things, tearing apart my room looking for them and then finding them right under my nose. I guess it is because I feel overwhelmed about being here at school. I just need to relax and enjoy this ride. I find it frustrating that parents and other relatives always give me the bad side of college, like, don't walk by yourself at night because you might get raped, don't spend too much money, don't do this and don't do that. Not that that is not valuable and understood but it's all negative. I like it when people are positive with me and say oh it's going to be great, you are going to have so much fun at college, you will learn so many things. My sister and her fiancé came to see me one day and my future brother-in-law made college seem like the best thing in the entire world. He is now a civil engineer and all he could say was that he wished he could come back to college because he enjoyed it so much. He really gave my roommate and me a better and more comfortable sense of being in college, instead of the Oh my gosh, I'm so scared of college and I know I'm going to end up killing myself view that is usually portray by others. Overall I am a mass of mixed emotions and look forward to anything and everything that I will experience here at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at Austin. 
__label__label0 Every time I try to use one, it goes wrong on me. I'm watching a movie right now. I's called seven years in LOCNAME. I need to learn how to type faster. I used a temp agency once, and they laughed at my typing skills. The movie just ended. I went to the dentist office today. No cavities. I want to sell him knives but I didnt ask him, although I should have. I go tonite to the meeting. I don't know how I feel about do that job. I know I nneed the money. I want to work out. I went yesterday and tried, but I got discouraged for some reason. This music is sootjhing. It's like my music, only a lot less structured. Same concept though. An epiphant of sound. Thecredits are over and the screen is blank. I'll take it back today, a day late. $0 for one extra day. That's where the video places make their money. Video places are a pretty smart business. Not too many becausets, the stock continuously makes money. I ahd to stop the movie. Be kind please rewind. I started racketball today. It's great. Early too so I get a start on the day. I met this guy in my class that I played with. He seemed shy and uncomfortable. I am already typing bettre. If any thing, this exercise will give me a good typing workout. I have eight more minutes. I'm not doing assignment two after thid one, its too boring. I tried to do the goddamn lab hour on the computer, but youyr shit says illegal opperation and kicks me foo of the internet. How the hell am I supposed to do the lab hour when it wont work. I hate computers. I have to do all my math on the damn computer as well. I prefer math on paper, especiallly because the math is extremely hard and the damn computer complicates even a simple lab hour esdercise. I'm not looking at the screen while I'm doing this. Four more minutes. I wonder how much /I've typed.                                                                                  three minutes. I got an eww lok for my locker. Its a key lock so I ty the key to my shooe. My friend in military school made this mushroom for me. A girl said it should be a book stander upper. my gloves are old. two minutes. ill just sit here until they're open. Time. 
__label__label1 I have so many things to do and not enough time. I feel like I am taking on too much. I know I can handle it if I get past these first few weeks, but right now I feel overwhlemed. I am stressed out with all the reading I have to do. I am such a slow reader and it takes so much effort for me to concentrate and take notes. I know though that I am a good notetaker and if I take the time I should do well in my classes. I am just too tired and stressed right now. I wish I could be at home where no one would come in to bug me or try to use my things and my computer. I am so frustrated with my roommates using my computer. It is new and I am worried they will mess something up. If I make it through till next Tuesday I will be ok. This weekend will be fun though so I just need to relax for once and enjoy it. I miss my family when I get stressed out like this. I keep telling myself"If I can only make it till December. " It is not that I dislike UT. I like my schedule and my professors, but it is just so different. I know this will be one of my hardest semesters, so with God's help, I will make it through just fine. I just need to relax and enjoy it. I am so determined to make a very good GPA this semseter that I hope I am not dissapointed. The scholarship requirements are good because it gives me a reason to work for them. Actually, I think it scares me more than it helps. I want to make good grades for myself. The scholarship makes me afraid of failure. I am such aperfectionist that I hate failure. I am determined to make a good GPA within my 00 hours. I want to prove everyone wrong who tells me I should have taken 00. If I took 00 I would be in summer school forever. I know I can handle it because I did so much in high school that I am prepared forit. I also don't care if people make fun of me for studying too much. It will payoff when they do bad this semester. I think I just need a break. I am caught up in my reading, but I need a week without 00 different activities for me to do. I just have to have confidence in myself that I can do it and things will get easier as the semester goes on. I felt so good though last night when I got 0 dates. Maybe I will meet some great guy while up here. I was beginning to have my doubts. I am excited about football season beginning. It should be fun to see all the college games. I love college football. I hope we do well this year. I feel like I am running out of things to babble about. Or that all I have done it repeat myself over and over. I guess it doesn't matter as long as I write what I am feeling. All I  hope is that I get everything finished early so that I can go to sleep early tonight. I think I will be able to do that. Well, maybe tomarrow will be a better day. I can't wait till there is nothing going on that I have to go out for. I am sure next week will be better. 
__label__label1 I have at least forty- thousand different things I have to do and about forty thousand different things going on around me  For one, my parents are out of the country, so it makes everything that much more complicated  second, I have been so busy with my sorority pledge class that I haven't really had time to do homework. just for the record, I feel completely overwhelmed right now. anyway, I went home this weekend just for one night and although it was extremely relaxing, it turned out that it was completely pointless to go because almost my entire family is out of the country. so I go anyway and have a great time just relaxing in my empty house with my dog and the tv, but I forget to bring back with me all my toiletries and makeup  luckily enough for me one of my best friends also went home this weekend and is coming back today, so I had to arrange with her a plan to get my stuff before she leaves that was a total fiasco because as I said before my parents are out of town and the only person who has a key is my aunt but PROPNAME, my friend, doesn't have a car so its just been crazy like that  so I get everything figured out with her but meanwhile my cousin who was house-sitting my house decided to come up to austin so I gave him list of things to bring from home, but we can never find a time when both of us are free so I still haven't gotten my much needed chemistry and calculus notes from high school (or my sunglasses)  its not that big of a deal its just that I really truly need this stuff and the fact that he was so close to my dorm and we never ended seeing each other. oh well I guess he can FedEx the stuff up to me  that way I'll get a package, that is really cool since I don't get any mail anymore. oh and I haven't even mentioned the fact that my computer just does not want to work. no matter how many people play around with it, it still wont work right now I'm using my roommates computer which I have to say is a lot easier to use than mine  I've had a total of I think 0 different guys in to look at my computer, two professional and two of my friends and no one can fix it. the last professional guy is sending someone else tomorrow to look at it because he's "really good"  at fixing this sort of problem  also he has better tools for the job. its getting really expensive to keep paying these guys to not change my computer  oh well I guess this counts as one of life's unexpected expenses  my parents always warned me about these unexpected incidents that cost a lot of money and I guess they prepared me for it I guess that's why I don't like to spend my own money by writing checks instead I prefer just to charge it to my parents I just wish they wouldn't get mad about it now I'm totally kidding  I have a monthly allowance now and I'm not used to it yet it takes time to adjust right?  overall, I am enjoying college I just have a lot on my mind and a lot to do not that that was any different in high school I was really involved in different organizations and I was in all AP classes so I did get stressed quite easily  I've been meeting a lot of new people of whom I love so far and staying friends with all of my best friends all of my friends live in my dorm so I'm really lucky to be able to experience college with them   
__label__label0 I lost interest of the situation but after a whole summer of not talking to her I started to miss her. I had attempted to email her but she never responded, I guessed that she was mad at me. I have emailed her 0 times with no reply but I am a persistent bastard so finally today, in fact just before I opened this page I decided to check my email as I do every day and there was her email. it explained that she had not checked her email all summer, it may not be true but it works for me. I proceeded to write her back thereby postponing this assignment around 00 minutes. I will eagerly await her reply as I basically demanded to see her. We'll see if she accepts. I never checked to see when I started this but I will keep on writing until I run out of shit to say. I assume that cursing is not a problem, I understand that this is a class full of naive little freshmen but I think we are all mature enough to hear such profanities, don't worry I wont go pornographic or anything but the instructions were to write what was on my mind and I am an avid cusser so I hope this will do (that is if anyone actually reads this masterpiece of stream of conciousness writing). now I am running out of things to say. I like most of my classes. my major is biochemistry. I am 00 years old. I have brown hair blue eyes,  I like to play football watch football,  OPENING DAY IS SUNDAY!  I live for football actually,  I like movies, I am filling in space. this is odd and I am going to stop now. thank you kent 
__label__label0 so far this class seems alright. I means the girls in this class look pretty good. there's this one girl in there, I haven't talked to her yet but I have to because she 's always looking at me. she looks pretty cute, but I can tell she is young. there's this other Hispanic girl  who has real tight curly hair . she looks incredible. shit all the girls in there do well who ever is reading this can probably tell hat I think about sex a lot. its strange because I always find myself daydreaming about having a wife and kids, you know having a real family. going to visit y folk and other friends with my kids. but it like no how hard I try, after I have sex with a lady, I just lose total respect for them, I just look at there flaws and I only look at the negative. with me, the way I think about a girl is totally different after we engage in hot intense intimacy. some times I don't know if it is just irrational thought processes or what. I know its not normal. but what is normal. normal is what society says is ok. but who is the society, whites blacks Hispanic, the melting pot of the us. or the world. there are so many different cultures and societies that essayist that who is to say that their ways are better then anybody else's. how can you say that is right and that is wrong because society deems it that way. if society is forever changing, are our moral standards to be forever changing as well. well it has been so far in our human history.         times up, nice talking with you 
__label__label0 That's what I thought, so I got very angry when earlier today they wouldn't sell me cigarettes just because my driver's license was expired. Then, they wouldn't sell them to my friend because they said that they knew that she was going to give them to me. It is ridiculous!!!  I am eighteen even if my driver's license is expired. Just because in the last two months I haven't had two hours to go and get it renewed, they're going to punish me by not letting me buy my nicotine. Some rules just make me so mad I could scream. Why would they do such stupid things?  I'm confused because I think that I'm afraid to audition for any of the plays here at LOCNAME because I'm afraid of failure, of not getting the part. My major is theatre arts and I hope to be an actress someday, and not one of those cheesy ladies on soaps. I want to be in movies and plays and be recognized and have money. I love acting and I've been doing it for so long and I never audition except for when I have to because I think maybe unconsciously, I feel less talented and afraid when they shake their heads at me. 
__label__label0 Today was pretty interesting. for a Monday. I only had two classes (Calculus and my favorite class with my favorite professor Mr. PROPNAME, who is an inspiration to me and an overall wonderful, smart, and funny guy). Do I get an A?  Anyway, my friend and I are waiting until about 00 pm so we can go to Blockbuster to buy "Titanic. "  Yes, we're crazy girls. Blockbuster is actually having a small Titanic party to celebrate its release. Phenonenal, huh?  I think so. Wow, only four minutes have gone by. I guess I type too fast. I     w  I  l  l    s  l  o  w     d  o  w  n. My roommate just asked me if I would hate her if she turned into a lesbian. Random question, huh?!  I told her "No. "  She is trying out for rowing and another girl said that there are a lot of lesbians that are on the team. It grosses her out, but she's still curious and thinks it might not be that bad. I think it's perfectly normal, especially in college, to be curious about those kind of things. I am. How many movies have they made about college kids trying out new stuff?  Now is the perfect time to explore our sexuality. It does bother me that she thinks she will "turn into" a lesbian without her consent. Is that even possible?  I don't think it is. Some people say that you're born gay and that it's not their fault. I don't know. I wish I did, but I don't. I guess I'll just have to see what happens.     
__label__label1 Right now I feel really happy and anxious because my family is coming to visit me. I miss them so much. This morning I felt different because they called me last night to tell me that they were not going to be able to come. This morning they called me to tell me they were anyways. Now I feel much better. I even felt like eating. There are mornings when I don't have an apetite. I have been thinking about college lately. I like it here but there are sometimes when I feel lonely. I wish I was with my family. But, I guess I have to learn to be by myself so I can know myself better. Lately I have been thinking about transfering to UTA. But I fear that my classes won't transfer. I really have to think about this one really carefull. Right now I also feel a little worried because I have so much homework to do. I don't even know where to start. Right now I feel like talking to my friends from high school but I don't have their phone numbers or their emails. I wish I could talk to a few of them, to see how they are doing and what their plans are for the future. I never thought that this assignment will be so easy. The thing that I most hate is this kind of assigment because I run out of things to say (like right now). Oh, today is my mom's birthday. This was one of the things I was sad about, yesterday. This would have been the first time I would have been away from home on her birthday. I really would like the 00 minutes to be over right now because I have a lot of stuff to do. The past two weeks I have notice how important TV is for me. I have to plan all of my life around TV. I can wait untill tonight when I get to watch my favorite program. I wish I could be someone famous right now. I don't care if is a model, actress, dancer or whatever but I would like to be famous. I also would like to live in LOCNAME. This summer was the first time I ever visited LOCNAME and loved it with all my heart. Hope one day I will move there and be like all the people from there. They all look like models, beautiful and well dressed. They all have incredible cars and clubs and restaurants. I can't wait untill November when I go to PROPNAME PROPNAME's concert, its going to be incredeble. 
__label__label1 I am very famished right now. I just got back from the psychology class. My stomach is gnawing, and I feel the grinding emotions. I haven't been very energetic the whole day. I almost fell asleep in my calculus class today. This is terrible, because I have never really gotten that tired in high school before. It always just seemed to be the calculus class that I almost fall asleep in. I am very frustrated at school. It is not only that I am a freshman, and that I am still trying to adjust to college life, but it is also due to my classes. For example, I have a biology class, with an excellent professor. However, his teaching assistant is making me really upset, because he can't really speak english. He is Indian, and I am sure he must be very intelligent, but I cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. I understand him on that basis, because I am after all a foreign student, and 0 years of high school have really changed my speaking capabilities. But I guess the older one gets, the harder it is for them to learn and adapt to new things. Anyway, I was vexed too, because he would not explain the questions asked by himself, but he would ask the class to input their answers. I understand that he wants the class to participate as a whole, but he can't just rely on students' answers. After all, we are just as confused. Math class is almost the same, except my math teacher speaks better than him. But Math has always been a tough area of subject for me. I have a bad history of math, and therefore I think that class is prone to my exhaustion. My professor is explaining math thoroughly, and he is very helpful and good, but my dislike for math overcomes me. I know that it is mind over matter, and that if I try to psyched myself to like math, I could probably get to put my energy into it. Don't get me wrong. I have always been a good student. I was valedictorian of my high school, and my high school is one of the best in LOCNAME. However, there are always some flaws even to the perfect, because no one is infallible, and I tend to procrastinate. This in the end results in my fears now. I am getting so nervous every day, because I am behind in my reading of assignments, and I am   worried that some professors are going to spring out pop-quizzes on me. I  also noticed that I not only tire so easily now, but my attention span has also increased, and my thoughts wander so much to the insignificant matter. I can't seem to concentrate reading in my room, when all the food, bed, noises, and I guess everything seems to distract me. Also, I have never been in a relationship before, not even dating, and in college, I thought it is where one may start for me. I often find myself looking out for guys. Even if I do get into one, I am sure that I will not do anything to jeopardize my future. I really want to be a doctor, and I am right now very worried about medical school. I really want to enter ORGNAME, and I am rather mad that they deferred me during early decision, and didn't admit me during spring decision. I guess I am being irrational here, but I did harbor the hope that I could get in because of the deferral. But that stumbling block will not trip me, I will still continue to work hard in college, get out with a 0. 0 ORGNAME, and hopefully a high ORGNAME score, and hope that I can apply to ORGNAME and get into med school. That would be a very nice, ultimate dream that I would ever want to fulfill. I am very hungry right now, and I am having a major headache trying to think if I should double major in something, because it is not wise just to major in biology, and think that everything including medical school will be smooth for me. I think I will visit my advisor on Friday.     
__label__label0 This is an interesting assignment to be doing. I don't like writing but this is different. I like being able to wrinte whatever pops into mw head and not worry about it being scrutinezed by an evil english teacher. Twenty minutes is a long time to be writing though. I could be doing sometinhg like playing a game of starcraft or half life right now, or writintg some c code. I am going to implement a router advertisement program to take advantage that windows boxes are stupid and let me remotly rewrite thier routing rules. Its nice of them to do this for me, but  I'll do that later. I wonder if I should write it under windows or Linux, or sine ither flavor of unix. I'll prob write it under windows if I gan get the neccesary access to the transport layer of the protocol stack just for that change of writing something usefull for windows. I actually have written some useful software for windows. Most of it would easily cross compile to unix. A fun peice of code I wrote takes a string such as "sin(x)^0-0**0-x^(e^x)" and evaluates it as a mathematical expression for a given value of x. If you've ever written code, this is not easy to do. I am listing to music right now. It helps stimulate the mind. :) I usually listen to music when programming. I am more productive that way. I am able to apporach problems and dig out the answer of some nasty place its hiding. 00 minutes sure is a long time when you would rather be doing something else. How many points do I get for doing this anyway. After I do thins I may go and eat or spend some time with PROPNAME, my girlfriend, who also happens to be my fiance  :)  she's great. After that I can write my router advertisement program. That would be fun. I love melissa. Being in austin is great. I like it much better that being in san antonio. I want there last weekend and wanted to be back up here the whole time. That could have been because all y stuff is up here. My parents miss me though. I sohuld call them. I;ll do that later. I have a lot of homework to do. Lets see, I'll check the chem web site after this and see what problems I have to do. I have to do the other assignment for this class later, and read. I have 0 sections of math, and reading and some homework in double E, college of engineering is college. I am a computer engr. student. EE is probably my best calss this semester, but psych is next, math is boring because it is going too slow (don't tewll my prof I wrote that) and I just don't like chem, the highlight of the class is when dr white starts singing. He is a weird guy. only 0 minutes before I can hit submit. I like ORGNAME. its a fun place to be. I need to buy another compputer. I host a site that provides free domain and web hosting to whoever wants it, and the boxes I have right now are slower thatn anything. I also need to call network soulutions and beat the m up until they do their jobs. I am hot. My apartment complex needs to fix the air conditioning. That would be good. aLl my roomates are in san antonio for the weekend, but I stayed here. I should call my parents later. That would be nice. I love melissa. 0 minutes left. my attention span is shortening. I will write my router advertisement prog first because melissa is sleeping. I need to go to ORGNAME and buy some sprite. I havent had any in a could days. Since shool has started I have gone through 0 00 packs. Tonioght I am going to try this company called midnight taco's for dinner. they sound good and operate between 0pm and 0am. I hope the food is good. I want a job, but a good one like I had in san antonio. I would like to put some moniy into my bank acct rather than just withdrawing it. That would be good. I only have 0 more hours of experiments to do, it will be nice to finishe them. I love melissa 0 minutes left I am hitting the submint button at exactly 0:00 , even if I am in mid-sentance. I need to turn the music back on, it finished playing, htats better, I can't spell (thats is waht I meant) rage againsta the machine is on. 0 more minute. PROPNAME is great. Shool is good, it will get better once I get into my major sequence. Time for me to go soon, I want that clock to say 0:00, the phone is ringing. bye 
__label__label1 What would happen without doing these writing assignments, how in the world does the Ta grade all off these papers with so many kids in the class. He would have to go crazy trying to give everyone a grade The view from my window is so drab I wish I lived on the eighth or even the seventh floor so I did not have to look at this wall all day. It is probably a nice day out but I can't tell because of this stupid wall. I need to go to the store. I hope that there is a good game of basketball at the gym today becasuse yesterday was boring, the girls team we played against the other day wasn't half bad, maybe they we show up again today. That girl was cute too, I wonder if she has a boyfriend. That girl down the hall needs to come back from wherever she went. She has the nicest hair. I need a haircut. I think that is the only reason I really want to go home is so I can get a haircut from PROPNAME. I guess I could do it myself, I think I have my clippers, I can never reach all the way to the back. Oh well I really don't think it matters how your hair looks everyone is usually to drunk to even remember your name let alone how my hair looks. I do feel better when my hair looks good though I think it gives me more confidence, Why is that? I sure have a lot of questions. Maybe I should pray about them sometimes that works and with this whole college thing I could use some guidance. Man I am hungry I miss my moms cooking Maybe I should go home for the weekend, I am sure she misses me, I hope. The cafeteria hopefully is open today I think we are down to the last two poptarts and I am sure we ran out of oj and milk yesterday. Football starts next week and we need our lineup for the league, I need to get that email address from PROPNAME to make sure we don't get penalized for being late or something gay like that. I don't want to do that chemistry assignment filling in those scantrons is so tedious and pointless. I can't get rid of this cough, that medicine that I have been taking just tastes good and does absolutely nothing for my chest or throat. I guess this is another day without food until we go to the store because the cafeteria is closed after one on holidays and with my laziness I didn't get up in time. Why didn't I set my alarm?  Breakfast is worth missing one hour of sleep especially when we have no food to eat until dinner. i need to go and check the mail, maybe that girl will have her door open and I can stop and talk with her, I wonder what she did this weekend. Long weekends are awesome. I wish we always had three days off it is so much more relaxing knowing that it is already tuesday when you go to your first class, it makes the week go so much faster. Does the mail come on Labor Day I don't think so but I really need to mail something oh well I guess it can wait until tommorrow. 
__label__label0 As I am told to write this assignment, I begin my forced thinking by trying to find the correct ideas to write in this paper, instead of thinking whatever I want to in an incomplete and disordered way as I have been used to since I got out of school three months ago. So it's very difficult right nom, and you will notice that I constantly get distracted and start babbling incoherently. I'll try to write this paper very spontaneously so you get the right picture; but be warned. Right before looking at the incredibly outstanding WebPage (yeah right!) for my PSY class, I was thinking where else could I surf the web, or if I should go to the pool here at my LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, or if I should start reading a bit, which is a definite NO. I mean, it's Friday!, or if I should write to my parents down in LOCNAME LOCNAME, etc, etc. So basically, I was evaluating everything I could possibly do in this boring Friday afternoon, when what I really anted to do was nothing. But I've had exactly three months of that since school in LOCNAME ended the 00th of May; and I immediately decided to do something productive which is this. I guess my mind is still warming up from all that time of null intellectual activity, and I'll get right back on track again. To tell you the truth, I think I am ready to start doing everything the right way, and not to procrastinate, which has been a big problem since I was born (I guess) or maybe it was because of my upbringing, or just because of the culture which I am a part of. As you may notice, I read chapter one yesterday and I can certainly notice a change in how I view things in my life and the life of others. In other words, I am starting to think in a psychological perspective already!    The 00 minutes are over, and I can say that for a moment there, I was really concentrated and just writing all of this. but just as I noticed that the time was up, I started to wonder into something else again. I think that it was probably because my attention span is a bit short, but I know I'll get better. Thanks for taking a little swim into my spontaneous and disordered thoughts and I hope I was not that boring. Now I guess I've done my productive "thing" for today, and I can take a swim into the pool right in front of me! Or maybe not. we'll see what my mind tells me later. 
__label__label1 I feel kind of nervous right now. I have never done anything like this before. at least not as something to turn in for a class. lately, I've been thinking about school and how this semester is going to. I need to start looking for a job sometime this week. one of my best friends is coming back from LOCNAME, LOCNAME this weekend, so I'm really excited about that. I haven't bought all of my books yet, so I'm hoping to do that soon, especially for this class because we have a test pretty soon. I took this class last semester but I totally slacked off and got a D in it, but I need to take it again in order to get into child psychology. I don't want to let my parents down again. my sister took this semester off because she got bad grades last semester. I know that I can do really well this semester if I really want to and I think that I do. I just really hope that everything works out ok. I guess you've probably noticed by now that I ramble on and on. I think that stream of consciousness is really cool. I think it was LOCNAME LOCNAME who made it popular. I think it was her. I  loved the way she would start talking about one thing and then that thing would remind her of something else and then she'd go off on that. I don't know how much I'm supposed to be writing . I think this assignment is neat. I hope that I'm going to be able to handle working and goingt to school. I worked at late night at jester last semester, and I think it was the hours that threw me off because I would work from 0pm to 0am. I live at kinsolving this year and I think that it's a lot better than Jester. I think I've been writing quite a bit already and I think that this is my stream of consciousness. all that I really do think about is doing well this semester because I want to be an elementary teacher already. so I guess I just hope.    
__label__label1 What am I thinking of right now?  I am thinking of how different my life now is. it is hard to believe that almost 0 weeks ago I left the city to which I have known as home my entire life <LOCNAME> and moved to austin by myself, with really no friends, no family and no place to really call home here. But everyone loves austin, right, and I am really lucky to be here, right?  I don't know but all I know is that I hope I made the right choice, my parents and friends, and family members really miss me and I miss them as well. I just really feel so lonely up here, I mean all I really do is study and watch television, not really being very social with that many people. And the weird thing is I am a very social person-- I mean in LOCNAME I had I think seven very clost friends, and now I have probably five okay friends that live in the same city as me, and who am I talking to when I am on the phone--my friends from houston, NOT austin. I think I am just in a period of adjustment right now, or at least I think and hope that I am. please do not let my college experience turn into this--my worst dream. why is it so hard for me to move on and make new best friends, it is not like I would forget about my friends from houston, I could be close to both sets of friends, and why is it that no people are out of there way friendly here, is it me?  no it cannot be me, that is what I always seem to tell myself, that it is not me. Gosh, I feel like I am having a conversation with myself right now, or that this an entry in my diary or journal or something!  But this is truly how I feel at this very moment in time---scared, alone, and wishing that I were somewhere else. I am really not trying to whine or anything, but how am I supposed to feel?  I am alone in a city, with nobody close, with whom I can communicate with. And these are supposed to be the best years of our lives, right?  Just checking because I plan to hold whoever first said it on that. Other than that, everything is going great, I am keeping up with my classwork, studying every night, with no disturbances. WHY?  because I have no friends up here, I realize that I am complaining an awful lot and really exaggerating when I say I have no friends. But like I said earlier:  I am a very social person, and when I do not have caring people around me, I feel left out. And that just about ends the twenty minutes, I guess it's on to the next one---and Yes, it does feel good to get this out in the open.         
__label__label0 My first thought is that this assignment is akward. This assignment is not the traditional type of work that I have done in any of my classes. But I am extremely relieved that this assignment is not difficult. I just have to write for twenty minutes straight without stopping or doing anything else. I can't believe that the weekend just came and went. It seemed like I was in class just hours ago, looking forward to the weekend. Now, Monday is already here. The long week of classes stares right in my face. But I don't like concentrating on the negative parts of life. I like to be happy; therefore, I think happy thoughts.   I am glad that the UT football team beat ORGNAME. I sure didn't miss sitting in the firey heat at the stadium!  I'm glad the team is doing well. I can't exactly say that about PROPNAME PROPNAME and his ORGNAME debut on Sunday. He did okay; 00 yards in 00 rushes. That's an average of four yards per carry. But he hurt his ankle. Again!  I really think he just needs to rest up and play when there is no pain at all. I know he is a tough guy, and it must be really tough for him to sit out a game. I am just like that, except I don't get paid millions and millions of dollars to play sports!     In other sports-related news, the ORGNAME ORGNAME have won ten games in a row. I am really happy about that. It looks like the 'stros will be making the post-season for the third straight year. The team looks good on paper. I have high hopes, but at the same time, I do not want to be disappointed if they lose. I probably won't even worry about the play-off games too much. I will be too busy in college!   Speaking of college, I need to find me a girlfriend. This really does mean a lot to me. But at the same time, I don't want a girlfriend just to have one. I want a special one. But those are hard to find. I guess I just need to be patient and wait for that right girl to walk into my life. But I really do get lonely sometimes. That part of my heart will always be empty. That's life though; I have to learn to deal with my discomforts. Looking for a girlfriend, it doesn't help that I'm butt-ugly!  I know that my personality is great, but women aren't looking for that nowadays. They want a good looking guy. Actually, women want that good-looking guy who is extremely nice and has a great personality. Unfortunately in life, guys are either handsome or have a good personality. It's hard to find a guy with both of those characteristics. Me, I'm the good personality guy. I have faith in God, and I will leave this matter in God's hands. I guess I ended up negative anyway. But I like to be happy. I want to think happy thoughts. Right away, I think about the summer program I just did. I taught seventh and eighth graders. They come from the inner city, and they have that stereotype label placed on them. But these kids are great. They have great potential. Unfortunately, they have very easy access to negative resources. But I'm just trying to be a good role model to them. I taught math for six weeks. The progam was a whole lot of fun!  I did so much with the kids. I took them out to malls, movies, Celebration Station, UH's game room, ORGNAME, an ORGNAME game, and skating. Every single one of those was tons of fun. If you asked me to choose my funnest event, it would be a tie between all of them. But right now, I really miss those kids. It's amazing how you can become attached to those kids in a matter of six weeks. But it was fun and I hope they have an awesome school year. I know they will, but you never know with kids!   Well, I guess my twenty minutes are up. I'm now thinking about whether or not I did this assignment right?  But I enjoyed this experience. It's good to clear your mind sometimes. I'm also relieved that I finished my first assignment. On to the second assignment!  
__label__label0 As I listen to this music I think about when I was younger, when I had a friend named Casey. But is she still my friend, or not?  What about PROPNAME, she thousands of miles away in LOCNAME. I really don't know what I feel for her. I want to be with her, but I don't think as much as she does with me. I feel guilty, but what have I done to her, I have been there for her, drove her around, let her cry in my arms. I must sound shallow, maybe not, I really don't know. Is she the one, I really don't know how to answer this question. What happens next, if she moves back, then she will probably live with me. I don't know if I can handle that. I have started talking to PROPNAME, she is very sweet, but is just someone to latch on to or is she really special. It started out harmless enough, but we have really started talking, and I really like her, as much as PROPNAME I really can't say, shouldn't I be worried more about school, I have astronomy homework due Friday. I feel like I can almost tell when PROPNAME is going to call or come in. right now she is one of my best friends, in a world that is new to me. in fact since I have been here, the best friend I have had. PROPNAME has a very sweet personality and a good understanding of people. much like many people I have met, good or bad I really can't say. sometimes I catch eyes with her and my heart takes a drop, a feeling that I haven't had in a long while. that really feels good, it opens you back up, makes you feel good, alive, a purpose. if I do break it off with joanna, what will happen, will that be a big mistake what if she is the one. how can break it off with someone who is in LOCNAME, that is cruel, she hasn't done anything to me, I haven't done anything to her though. you get to a point where living life in a certain way or doing something in a certain way is just not right anymore. or doesn't seem right, being or I am really not with her, just doesn't seem right. but if I am not with her anymore will it not seem right in that respect also. this subject is really what I hide from in life, am a an asshole, or I am just telling the truth to myself, I mean after all the school saying or whateveris YE SHALL TELL THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE is the truth making me free or tearing me apart, I think I do love joanna, that is the bummer part, but to go into it with the scales tipped is just wrong, maybe I am wrong, I really don't know  
__label__label0 I have no idea where to start on this thing, and I forgot to look at the clock 0:00, okay, I feel better now. This has got to be the longest version of LOCNAME LOCNAME ever, it takes them about 0 years to start singing. I need to go to the grocery store, need to get some milk and hot dogs. the essentials. Could probably just run to the 0-00, then I could get a slurpee. This chair is still uncomfortable, even with this cushion. Should just by a new one, but don't know where I'd put this one in this tiny room. Dorms suck. Living it up at the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Man, my typing skills have gone downhill, it's sad. I really should throw that bottle of water away, it's probably getting kind of funky. I'm going to fill this whole thing up in like 00 minutes, then what?  I want concert tickets, that was stupid waiting and then they sold out. I don't really want to pay a fortune, maybe 00. Doubt I could get them that cheap. I'm surprised PROPNAME hasn't charged over here yet, the morning's been really quiet. I've got so many things to do, none of which I probably will. got to write those thank you notes, if grandparents keep sending me cash I never will have to go to the bank, good deal. Oh, the screen moved up, maybe I won't fill the whole thing up. Ten minutes to go. My shoulder kind of hurts, must be sitting kind of funny. I wonder if I'll ever need those receipts, should probably just throw them away, see how much I can junk up my bullentin board, like I did my room. I could watch All My Children while I write my thank you notes, that sounds like a plan. I hope it's not a hayley and mateo day, don't think I could handle that. Got to love PROPNAME PROPNAME. this song brings back memories of 0th, no 0th grade. I think I liked 0th grade, don't really remember. Back at good old H. m. s. I should really go find PROPNAME and reminesce. Don't think that's spelled right, whatever. Haven't talk to PROPNAME in awhile, she's probably off trying to be the next PROPNAME foster. psycho. Maybe she'll be home for the balloon fest, doubt it. It's going to be so hot and miserable, at least I'm not dancing. Wonder who'll be taking my place, hope it's not chrissy. PROPNAME will probably be back in my spot. That would suck. My foot's asleep, three minutes to go. The computer better not crash now. I really should clean this room up, that's probably on the list of things to do. I wonder what song is next. Oh, that's the end, good my time is up. 0:00, yeah. 
__label__label1 I wonder if my parents are coming to visit me this weekend because I need a lot of things. In fact I need a lot of things. I hope this creating stuff really works. O yeah, that math 000c class seems really intimidating. I wonder if I can really get through because I was struggling through the review session today. Well, at least  tomorrow is friday. thank god. I need a major break. it is funny because I really and honestly want to achieve so much yet I feel so far behind from where I think I need to be. I'm just falling falling far behind. I must get back into shape and into the jist of things. I seriously need a massage. My legs are killing me. I must have walked ten thousand miles today. only 0 months left to go. great. that pennebaker professor seemed pretty cool. I don't think I want to drop that class because it is so hard to get into but it also seems like it will be interesting. I have never taken a psychology course. ba000 can wait. I wonder how all my friends are doing back home. do they miss me?  probably not. I have been here for a week almost. I have met some new people but not as many as I should have. too bad. well, we still have a long time. I think I should join some clubs but I don't know where. hmmmm. this song sucks. I can't wait until friday. I miss everyone I knew. it sounds strange but I really miss them. I need to work out some more. I feel so tired. but I am really surprised I am not  homesick. though I do miss the food. I can live like this. it seems pretty fun even though I don't have a car. I think my dad and my brother went bowling. I feel so sleepy. I miss playing the piano and the guitar. I came here to escape a lot of things but it seems that the distance has brought me closer to what I wanted to get away from. lucky for me there are a lot of distractions because sometimes I find myself thinking about somebody more than I should. I don't deserve this. why does this sound so depressing?  let's t hink happy thoughts. that girl van that I met today seemed pretty cool. really very outgoing and even waited for me after class. that's pretty cool. I am glad I have dan as a roommate. his sense of humor is always there. I feel like playing basketball but I need to catch up with schoolwork already. the sad things is that it is the second day only. I can't believe I have the same 0 classes with tyson, some guy I met at camp. what are the chances of that?  and Lira my second cousin was in my economics class. so is angela johnson from my old high school. but the professor. well  nevermind. so many memories. time to make some new ones. should I call my parents tonight. yea I t hink I will. dang I still have to do that calculus homework. I hope it is not that long. I need to do a lot of reading too. for mis 000 so I can get caught up. well the good thing is that my day is over at lunch time. yay!!!  but dan is going back to houston and leaving me all alone. so many th ings to do so little time. but I love the ut experience. I really do. hookem horns.

__label__label0 Well right now I only have a couple things on my mind that don't seem to leave my head all day long. The two big ones are this guy I saw again and had a great time with and my school work. These two things are really bugging me. First off with school I am worried about what type of grades I am going to get,whether or not I am going to keep myself on top of my works, whether or not I will have the will power to actually tell people no I can't do this because I have to study, how are the first test in all my classes going to go, is there going to be an overwhelming amount of information on my exams that I am going to have to knwo, how much harder are these tests going to be then my test I had in high school, how exactly do I study for a college test when there is so much information to know, how specific are the questions going to be on the test and are they going to be tricky questions. These are a lot of the questions that run through my head and I am not usually a person who freaks out about stuff in my life. I guess another reason I am so worried is because I would really like to get into the business school if possible, but everyone tells me how hard it is and that I am going to have to make a 0. 0 and then even then I possible could not get in if I don't have the right connections or know the right people. So on that note, I am starting to try to figure out exactly what am I going to do with my life or major in if I don't get into the business school. I guess there are other things that I am interested in, but it would just make life a lot easier if I got in. The other major thing on my mind is this guy a saw again and hung out with the whole weekend. He is such an extremely nice guy, smart, gorgeous, and so much fun to be around and totally sweet. I haven't been treated like he treated me in a long time. He seemed totally into me too, but I don't know. I guess the whole self-conscious thing is coming into effect of whether he felt as strongly about me as I did about him. He seemed like it though. He also just happens to go to ORGNAME ORGNAME too. Which makes things even more confusing. One, if we were to become boyfriend and girlfriend would things really actually work out doing the whole long distance relationship thing?(It's only an hour and 00 minutes away, but still that's different than living in the same town 0 minutes away) Also what goes on in my head is would I really want a boyfriend right now just starting off college and would I really want to put up with whole long distance thing. I can't stop thinking about him and I think he would be worth doing it for if that was what he wanted too. He is actually 0 years older than me, so I know and recognized he already went through the whole party and chasing all the girls phase that a lot of people go through when they first start college. I don't even know how this guy exactly feels about me so in ways I am crazy thinking all this stuff so quickly and soon in my head. I just could tell how much he cared by his actions and things he said that he must be feeling the same way that I do, but who knows I guess time can only tell how the future of my grades and how this guy and I are going to work out, so I should probably stop stressing and worrying about it so much. I guess I can only prepare myself the best I can for all my classes and whatever happens with the guy I guess is ment to be. 
__label__label1 I have just finished reading the second chapter of the psychology textbook for class today. My room mate is always playing spades on the internet. I type very loudly. My subwoofer speaker system really looks cool the way I have it set up on my desk. This is a very odd, but interesting, assignment. The combination of the fan and air conditioner noise is driving me crazy. It is like the drone of a prop-plane. My computer is constantly checking for viruses and is always making little "engine" noises while I am typing. My room mate has a very odd way of typing. As I am doing this assignment, I am hearing myself talk the words as I type. I am sure that I have always done this, however, until now I have not noticed it. I believe that I just heard thunder. we could use the rain. I can't believe that we had a pop test in spanish today. I have a knot in my stomach. I know that I did poorly on it. I have a great spanish resource. my 000 verbs book. My monitor also makes a noise that sounds like I would imagine electical energy to sound. I want to go home this weekend. I miss my brother. I am going to bring him to LOCNAME sometime to hang out with me and see the sights of UT. What time is it?  I wonder if my package has arrived in the mail room, yet?  I wonder what my dad thinks of all of my difficulties with the percussion ensemble here?  I would like to retreat to LOCNAME LOCNAME and bask in the glory of the crystal clear water and the LOCNAME LOCNAME. That was a very random thought. All of the intricacies of the human brain are very amazing. If my cardiothoracic surgery bid does not work out, maybe neurosurgery could be an option. I have never had a class quite like psychology 000. I like the fact that it is web based. If I happen to miss a class, it is relatively easy to track down what was discussed. And even if the web doesn't have the information, the study sessions should cover the material again. I wish that I would have attended the first study session. I wish that I hadn't signed up for the molecular biology honor society. my plate is full already. That is such a strange idiom. I wonder how it came about. I wonder if idiom is the correct term for that expression. I have a very nice printer. It's fast, silent, and very clean looking. I am definitely a strange guy to be admiring his Deskjet!  I had to buy a lot of books for my spanish class. It has turned out to be my hardest class. I do not think that I am going to take any more spanish after this semester. I don't think that I was truly prepared to take spn000k, but I must have guessed well on the PROPNAME test. I hope that my friend PROPNAME does well at ORGNAME this weekend. I can hardly believe that he was the number one defensive pick in the nation. It seems like just the other day when we were playing together for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. Now the guy is 0'0", 000lbs. !  I really enjoy football and I miss the contact, but my I'M experience this fall should be a lot of fun without all of the bruises. I really want to lift weights tonight, but I don't believe that I will have time. I also want to train with PROPNAME, but I don't know what he has planned for tonight either. It feels like I have been thinking for hours, but It has only been a few minutes. This definitely reinforces the fact that the mind is better than any computer mankind can build. At least until some sort of artificial intelligence comes along. And even then, that won't compare because "artificial" is in the name. I really hope that my timer goes off soon and I can stop writing. I think that it would be really cool if I could guess the exact time the buzzer will sound without looking at the clock. It would be like ORGNAME. That reminds me of a kid who did a debate over the existence of ESP in fifth grade gifted/talented class. It makes me feel good to say that I have been identified G/T. That's very cocky sounding, but I don't believe that I have told anyone of my identification in years. I have a problem with cockyness. I had better watch out or someone or something is going to come along and put me to shame in embarrasing fashion. 
__label__label1 Well all I can think about at the moment is how stressful college is and why we have so much work to do. I don't understand it at all and I am very stressed out at the moment. highschool seemed so much easier but I know that it is something that I need to get used to. on top of it all I have so much sorority things to do. we have so many meetings and assignments to do on top of all of our school work. I just want to sit in my room and sleep because I am not feeling well. also I miss my parents. eventhough they are fifteen minutes away I am missing them but when I get around them they annoy me so bad. I don't understand it. I am difinately looking forward to our weekend because I know that our pledge retreat will be so much fun. especially becauase I cannot wait to get to know my pledge sisters. it will be awesome. I feel disconnected from so many of the girls and I know that they are feeling the same way. we seem to go out with the same people every weekend when there are fifty other girls that we still haven't really gotten the chance to meet. I really miss my friends from home a lot. especially jenna. but I know that she is having a blast at tech with kristi. the dorm is awfully quiet tonight. more so than usual. it is very weird not to hear people running up and down the halls screaming at the top of their lungs. it's actually very nice. I probably won't be able to sleep because I am so used to the noise. sleep also sounds really nice. I feel like I haven't done it in a year. now that I am sick I know that sleep is very important but who has time for sleep when there is a million other things to do in life. I also need to do laundry sometime in the next century before I run out of socks to wear. I think my mom said she was going to buy me some new socks this weekend but I never saw those. I wish it would just rain so then I would have an excuse to just sleep all day long. sleeping during a storm is so awesome. it feels so comforting. this is really weird just writing about random things. I feel like I am talking into a recorder or something or just having a really weird dream. actually I feel delirious just looking at all of the random thoughts that go through my mind. I feel like it's deep thoughts by jack handy. if you ever evaluate what you think about it funny to think that "we always sweat the small stuff and it's all small stuff. "  my dad loves that quote and he also reminds me of it. when I went to the doctor today he was writing down random quotes on the hospital bed paper about college and lecturing me about school. it was really annoying. oh well he was a very old man anyways. he told me never to forget those quotes and of course I already did. what does he expect of a busy girl like me. crazy people. well my time is up. I wish I could type faster so I would have more to say but this is it. random thoughts by PROPNAME PROPNAME. 
__label__label1 Being at cllege is a new experience for me and I think that it is giving me  a sence of being dependant on myself. I like all the new freedom that I have  gotten, but I also am homesick a lot. I miss my parents and being in my house  in LOCNAME. There isn't anyone to make sure that I do everything that I am  supposed to do. I am a person that does not get stressed out a lot, ut now that       I am in college and having to take care of everything on my own, I am  getting worried and that is gettting me scared. I have a lot of thing s that I  need to get accomplished and don't have time for it. It makes me very  frustrated and annoyed at the same time. I feel like I should be a lot more  organized and up to date with everything. I am a very organized person, even a  "neat feak," and that is why it's driving me crazy when I am behind. I think  that if I work hard, then I will do alright.       Last weekend, I went home and visited my friends and family and it felt so  good to be home. I was able to go driving around and I knew where everything   was, and that feeling of being in control was great. think that I just need  time to settle into ORGNAME, and then I will be in more control. Austin is never  going to be "home" for me, but it will be a place that I can come to enjoy. I  don't think that any city can compare to LOCNAME because that is where I grew up  and that's also where I have all of my family and friends.       Sometimes I think about how life would be like if I was adopted or even if  one or both of my parents were dead. I look back and don't think that I could  manage. My parents play a very important role in my life and I don't think that  I would be the same person that I am without them. I know a lot of people that  have parents that have passed away and they have really gone through some rough  times and they are doing well now, and I give them so much strenght and poer for  being able to do that. If my mother would pass on, I think that I would really  go into a state of depression, and would go trough a transformation, in that I  would become very quiet when usually I am very outgoing and lively. Many things  don't affect me unless they are very close and dear to my heart. I usually  don't cry in movies, and I don't care to become very emotional all the time. I  have too much pride to cry infront of people other than my family. No matter  how depressing the news, I am unable to show my emotions. That is something  that I think that I get from my parents, specifically my mother. I think that I  have gotten a lot of my qualities from my mother and most of my physical  qualities from my father. I think that I am able to be the person that I am  because of my parents. They helped shape me into the person that I am.       There are friends that I have been close to in high school, and ever since  I have come to UT, I have not been as close to. I don't know the reason for the  change, other than the fact that our schedules are conflicting and that we have  not tried as hard to keep in touch. I have heard that things like this happen  and that you make all of your really good friends in college. I know what  people say, but I have a really good friend at ORGNAME and me and her have keep  in touch really well. I think that she is an exception to the "rule. "                               
__label__label0 My mind keeps jumping back and forth between this year right now and like all of high school. I have such problems with sharing people and friends that my mind is constatly taking me back ana forth to times when I've been in sumilar situations. Cheaters are something I end up with a lot when I date people so the idea of sharing male friends is sdcary to me, I feel bad for being jealous of other girls who hang out with my male friends, but I can't help wondering if they are all destined to follow the same pattern as everyone else. My com[puter is broken in my room so I have to use the lab. I can't stand the noise of either bi;llion people typing at once, and the talking girls behind me are growing more annoying by the minutes. Cranky woulsd be a good wor to decribe how I feel. Reelly Really cranky. I don't know why either, so far everything has gone my way, from rush to guys to sports to school (thats what I'm here to do right?) but at the same time I'm being a total crab! I guess it's gets back to that damn jealousy thing again. I hate that part of myself, it's annyoing as all hell and I can't ever seem to get past it, the rest of my life is totally laid back, yet this is the one part that I freak out on. I can't imagine writting straight for twenty minutes. It took me three to write this, so I can't really understand how I can just blaber for twenty minutes. The sosrity girls are all really nice, the party at the delts was okay, ORGNAME was pretty lame, but none of the new ADPi pledgees no anyone so I'm hoping that once we do some mixers or something along those lines I'll know some more people and therefore have more to do at these parties besides drink my ass off. There's an ATO bar-tab tonight at Sidestreet and a PhiSI party somewhere too, but beong a nice friend I offered to stay in with PROPNAME who is walking on to the football team tomorrow, but he's also got three other girls upstairs, there's the jealousy thing again. PROPNAME. I left my shoes at the house and don't havce any comfy shoes to wear tmomorrow, sigh. The pledge retreat is this weekend, actually more likethis friday and some of saturday, so that'll be fun, but it's a little scary becasue we are all still just getting t knowone and other. I can't go to the first football game because the girl I was surposed to get tickets with ditchedout on me and I don't have a ticket, so going is not going to be possible, which sucks, becuase I really did want to go and get all involved and stuff. Good god, it's annyoing to have al this to do, I can't imagine how much time all these assignments are going to take, between this class and my theatre major-stuff, I have nooo time and am surposeds to join two outside organizations besides my sorority. If I get cast in a show, there isn't any way I'll be able to make any meetingings with any kind of consistency, but I really wantto beinvolved in everything thats going on. I have to do my laundry too. Somethings got to go and that looks like sleep, at least for the first semester sleep is going out the window until I get this grades business firgured out. Okay, ten minutes left. My room smells like stale coffee (true dorm) and chicken soup becasue retard king brad spilled soup on my floor, and we cleaned it up with paper twels, but not like actual soap, so I'm kinda scared as to what might be living under my bed at the moment. I have new momagrammed sheets that I'm way psyched to put on my bed, because they are those totally comfy jersey knit sheets, and I'm all about soft stuff. My room has turned into a pit, by the way, toaly a disaster area. Yuck-ola. My wallet has been getting fatter, but not, sadly, with money, way too many passwordsa nd numbers accounts and figures to rmemeber just to use these damn computers that run WAY too slow for their own good, or anyone elses for that matter. God damn. I tried to go ahead and do the survey so I don't acidentally forget and not doit, but the comnputer wouldn't laod it becasue I was transimiting my social security number and it didn;'t like that at all, so I guess I'll have to find a friend and mooch of them. Bad time to quit smoking. Almost done. The yamm,ering can stop shortly. Found my comfy pants on a non-cranky not, and that's wonderful becasue I could really use some good comfy pants to just lounge around in. My room looks like a laundry basket blew up on the floor and splattered everythingin it's path. My poor roommate, I don't know how she puts up wih all my shit. She just got cheated on and I feel so terrible having been in the same posotion myslef,and I wsh guys weren't such total morons about stuff like that. boohoo hormones. Two minutes left. I can't understnd my TA in math calss. He speaks english about as well as I speak french, and I know three french words. People say numbers are universal, yeah right, try sitting through a math class with a non-native english speaker as your teacher and see how universal they are come finals. Ah! Done. 
__label__label0 I really wish people would be more efficient with their laundry. It annoys me to no extent when people don't keep up with it. Just a few minutes ago I was trying to wash my towels and I couldn't because the person left their clean, washed clothes in the washer. I felt bad taking the stuff out and leaving it around. It's not like I would of thrown it on the floor or anything, but I feel wierd picking someone else's clothes and underwear out of the machine. Well I built up the courage because I was annoyed and I then realized that the machine next to it, which was in use before, was now free. So I had a whole who-ha over nothing. Oh well. I actually love doing laundry for some strange reason. I love clean clothes that smell really good. I use dryer sheets and fabric softner so they smell extra yummy. I keep looking at the clock because I'm waiting for Road Rules to come on. They kicked this girl PROPNAME off last time because she has an alcohol problem. I really don't think it solved the problem at all. Now she'll be even more inclined to do whatever she feels like. I guess I've never lived with or experienced alcoholism so I wouldn't know what it is like. Needless to say, PROPNAME is extremely reluctant to go to rehab. She firmly believes that she is a strong enough person to do this on her own. Don't they all say that? Well I hope she gets better because I know it must be an extremely hard thing to overcome, especially by yourself. I think professional help is an extremely good thing and nothing to be ashamed of. I know many people who have had rough times and psychiatrists and psychologists are very helpful in overcoming depression, alcoholism, or whatever it may be. I know that a lot of celebrities go to shrinks. PROPNAME PROPNAME talks about it openly- about herself and with her guests too. She thinks it's a great thing. I think it's good that occasionally you can have someone who listens to you regardless and someone that you know will not judge you in any type of way. Although I am a firm believer of not having other people tell you what to think, I think this is totally different. These kind of people are trained and don't tell you how your mind works. I think they simply stimulate ideas, thoughts and reactions that allow one to think about things in different lights and more fully. Ok-enough about that. I've noticed that my roommate takes really long showers. I take mine in the morning and I'm in there for seriously about 0 or 0 minutes. Whereas she's in there for like 00 or so. I wonder why that is. I guess I'm in such a rush in the morning that I'm not going to stand there idely and have a think about my day. There doesn't seem to be enough time to do that now but I guess essentially I'm doing that now. Maybe it's not all it's cracked up to be. I'd rather focus on what's ahead tomorrow rather than the stressful day I had today, primarily in the computer lab. I've decided that I really don't like programming and the technical stuff of computers. I really don't care how it works as long as it does for me. I'll just have to put up with that class until Christmas to get my credit. I'd feel kind of sad if I was a professor and people only took my class because their academic advisor advised them too or if they just did it to fill their credits. I guess they're used to it and don't take it personally. Whatever. Ok- time's up now. I've been writing for 00 minutes as told. Bye. 
__label__label1 Simply amazed that someone has seen to it that I make it this far without more than what I have experienced that is comparable to adrop in the bucket considering that sometimes I could give a damn about what is best for me for the simple fact that I'm in it for the everything I can get only at times it's entirely too much to compute at once. boy, where has the trrain of thought gone to? Maybe it left to another place out of sight but never to be out of my mind becaause it seems to me that I'm already there. I suspect that everyone else is in their own way. that's why we are told everyone is "special" when we ae too young too know exactly what that means. I'm glad payed attention that day. Uh oh. here it comes again. jealousy rears it's ugly head signaling for the dogs who are  no less guilty of the crime than the one they persecute with their fingers crossed in vain hope wanting our hero to sacrifice his integrity for ideals of what was considered to be right by those who were so afraid of what it was they were dealing with that they confined themselves to an ignorant prejudice. well them fools can stay there and pray they never realize exactly what they're missing until it has already become a haunting unidentifineable thorn in their calloused side. Brains bruised with ignorance rather than blessed with memories of the world they restricted themselves from and feared to the day they wished they had not been such pussies. I cannot pity them, I have no time to devote thought to their rancid exsistence. I have my own to look after. I'm here know and those who would seek my friendship will have it. and those who seek my love will find it. and those who desire my trust and confidence shall not betray it or I shall strike down upon them with the fury of a thousand chained hatred's fire until their very soul. 
__label__label1 well, I don't really know where to begin. it's my 0rd week of school and I guess it's going okay. my classes are getting harder but I suppose I'm getting into the "rountine" of things. i don't know wether I'll go to the ISA meeting today cause I know what kind of peeps will be there but I am definetely going to the ORGNAME meeting. i think that'll be a really fun club cause of the people that are in it. the social this saturday should be cool. i havne't called mom today so I should do that before I leave for the meeting. on friday, I am finally going to meet this girl that I haven't seen ever since freshman orientation. i have so much stuff to tell her. that's one of the things that I really hate about college. that it's so hard to make plans with people. and that you can only catch them at certain times cause no one's in their room all the time. damn, we have this cricket in our room right now and I don't know where it is. i've tried looking for it so many times but I can't find it. it keeps chirping every now and then, sort of letting us know that it's still there. haha. ti's so annoying cause at night the little thing thinks it's outside so it just chirps away. anyway, what else is going on. i don't really like my calculus class cause everyone in there is really snobby and already attached to their own group of friends. i don't know how that happened and where I was, but whatever. you'd think in a class like calculus there'd be a bunch of nerds, but not at all. i have to go shopping soon. i need one of those wallets with the key chain thingy attached to it. that would make my life so much easier. it's strange how little things can make your day go a lot smoother. like, getting down to the cafeteria right before it closes. or meeting someone after a long time and spending the whole day with them. or getting a call from someone you love. or realizing that you're going to be okay at LOCNAME. or getting a good night's rest after a long time. those kinds of things. okay, that was a really weird tangent. anyways, um. got nothing to say. oh, okay. i find it really hard to get on line once I'm at college. i dunno. i just feel like it's a chore to talk to people or write really long letters and I'm sure my friends are getting a little ticked that I'm doing that. but, I just feel like I'm wasting my time on the comp. i really want some grapes right now. i went to ORGNAME yesterday and I got all this fruit. actually, I think I got too much. but anyways, I got the really big maroon seedless ones. oooh, they are the best. i wish they had better shopping places on the drag. either it's too expensive, or the clothes just suck. I feel like going out today cause I don't have a class till one tommorrow. maybe to a nice restaurant or something. well, actually, I'm finding it really hard to make myself do something. like, for examle, I need to mail out the thank you cards for my graduation party, as it is, they are already 0 weeks late. and I just don't have the will to do it. i mean, I see them everyday sitting on top of my desk, but I jsut don't do it. and I have to look at my bills and balance my checkbook and stuff but I hate doing that kind of stuff. i dunno. i guess I'm just getting too lazy. the other day someone accused me of that, and proved it to him by doing something taht I would have ordinarily not done and when I told him about it yesterday. he just said that I did it for me not for him. it didn't really make a difference to him wether I did it or not. and I realized that was true. when you do something out of spite, you're not doing it for anyone else but yourself. i miss my mom. i need to send her a card soon. 
__label__label0 I don't like computers really,  they are kind of a pain in the arse, but things are getting better, you know,  people learning new things, new methods of compression and technology makes you stop and thinks when is a computer going to be too fast. . my parents are okay too I guess they just aren't in the "loop:" as one might say,  always having to show them how or bring them up to date and shite, but . . school's fun, math is not okay. PROPNAME PROPNAME is awesome I'd love to meet one day. lot's of people listen to her, why should I be the only one to get to meet her?  carl thinks he can play bass, but he can. why?  why does jimmy stink?  why do people love anime so much?  ani is a hottie. often in class I find my self fantizing about what is would be like to meet her. just hang out with her and stuff. be all buddy buddy, get a fone call everyonce and a while and just see hwo things are going down. making sure she okay, even tho she's married,  I don't' think it will last, she's too free and out will mr. difranco is never around always at home,  I think it's first love syndrome. oh well. PROPNAME is awesome,  she's soo cute and so funny, and just awesome in everyway, she's not that much younger than me either,  she's very smart, and did I mention cute?  wish I knew what exactly she thought of me,  wouldn't I be wierd if who if anyone ever is reading this comes up to me in class and starts commenting on what I wrote?  that would be too freaky, this college is kinda stupid. first of all I'm not 00 yet so they won't let me get the fancy shmancy email account yet the other day they let me get a 0000 dollar loan which I have to pay off in 0 months or they sue me . . wacky oif you ask me, but then again who is?  this campus is so huge no one knows anyone around here, none of the professors, none of the students,  you smile at someone and immediately your somesort of wack job walking down the street stoopid people keep bothering me, don't they know I'm trying to write?   bno respect I tell you, none from no body not my parents, not my stoopid facking roommate who thinks he's my father,  him and his girlfriend I tell yoiu, first of all they are not very pretty people to begin with and then they are always here having sex and dammit it get annoying,  always trying to include us. not leaving alone when I don't want to ber apart of the picture. always is it okay if I don't this or we're goint to have sex now don't oing tin to the bed room I don't' car ego and getr phreaky don't tell me about it. ican't ccare less,  I just bugs the hell out of me when they decide, "well jason is feeling left out of our circle of love lets include him"  and I don't want to have any thing to do with them and when they are togheter it's fucking discussing. they act like fuckingh middle schoolers. always hopping and bopping about acting all like "I love you" I love yout oo let's have babies. holding hands and licking lips . never a moments rest of it,  it's enought to make you want to grab the rifle and end it one way or another. dammit . and carl always talking about how big his phallus is. I mean it's okay every once and a while. like on vacation and stuff. but every five minutes?  him I can tolerate,  go figure. ben used to be cool now he's just a useless pain in the arse. PROPNAME is pretty cool, but he's always going on about how everyone's gay and they should be proud of it. I mean it okay but when he tries to convince mne that all I know is gay everytime I see him it gets fucking annoyimg,  maybe I get annoyed to easil, not really things don't tend to annoy me,  just stoopid peole. people who don't know when to stop being stoopidn and take stoff as their own and well start being just there. I wish scarlett was here sute she did some questionable things but she was really cool about evertyhing I can't fart but carl can like the dickens pikachu, polemon is funny , tell you when they ge to talking and stuff it can make your day,  everything just falls in to place and you think to your self you know at least my vocabulary issn't just my name that would proabably suck. just jas ja jja jaosn on on jaos jaoson jaosn would get too annoy anyone eventually. what about people named al tnow that would suck for them. a a a a a all al al llll l l al al dman now speech for them. ca ca ca ca rl rl carl car lr rl rl it's pika chu dalkt  and would about those foregin peole. to summ it all up  I hat my life 
__label__label0 Well here I am sitting at the computer typing very badly as always, constantly hitting the backspace key. I just rebought my books from varsity books online becuase some of or rather one of the books I have is signifigantly cheaper there and then I registered for some sweepstakes tat they have- like I could ever win one of those things but you never know in eighth grade at the going away dance only for eighth graders I won a bag of blowpops huge bag and I never ate most of them they sat in my desk drawer for a long time and then as a periodically clean my desk drawer I would find one and throw it away. My roomate is on her computer too typing awaay talking to her boyfriend she is so dedicated she already finished all her homework already I'm still just kind of trudging along. I'm really tired its time to go to bed I wonder if I should take advil because I had my wisdom teeth out on friday but I'm really tolerant to pain so I never even took the perscription pain medication- but I have no idea if anything is wrong because I just sort of ignore the pain. After I finish this I am going to take a shower we talked with our suite mates about the bathroom and stuff my roomate is talking to me about having a place to stay for her boyfriend over labor day she doesn't know who of her friends will be here so he might stay in our dorm but I know that they won't do anything I'm probably going home because I live here in austin then he can stay in my bed if he wants it won't bother me he's a nice guy- I have only known jenny for 0 days and it seems so much longer we really get along pretty well we come from similar backgrounds too. We both grew up in the LOCNAME with parents from LOCNAME so we have similar backgrounds. I filled out that survey it was so strange and so long. The pre-test thing. I'm just an all over goody goody so it was interesting to think of people filling it out diffeently with their true lives I'm such an innocent and I don't see people doing bad things liek drinking or having sex and abortions. One of our suite mates rushed and she got into ORGNAME and some of her sorority sisters are taking her out tonight and I asked where she was going and she said to some frat parties and she was going to come back completely hammered it made me wonder because it's the first day of school and she has an 0:00 class tommorow but oh well it's not might life or my concern. this room is so cold. and she seems so smart to she took all the ORGNAME classes and I think she was on drill team too. And she has a bum of a boyfriend or something like that it seems like everyone has a boyfriend but me but thats ok I don't need a guy to make me happy even though I would like a boyfriend- I've never had one before that is so strange but that's ok. I saw a lot of people from high school so far well not a whole lot but that's ok. There are a few of us from church here also PROPNAME who is in this class too was supposed to come help me update my differentials on norton or something- my brother like ICQed me and told me to do it at least once a week I had no ide what he was talking about and I tried to do it. I can't believe I have so much to do already I have a lot of classes I thought it would kind of be like high school but I don't think so I saw a few people around campus that I know from church it was really weird thinking I knew them and stuff and seeing them- you can tell all the freshman on campust because they walk around with maps in there hands and they get to class about 00 minutes early but that won't last long- especially those 0 o'clock classes oh I think I need to charge my cell phone I'm not sure oh well. well I think my twenty minutes is up and I'm about to completely fall asleep and one of my suitemates is in the bathroom so I guess I could read sociology until she is done but. well good night. 
__label__label1 I am presently thinking that I cannot believe that I am actually going to sit here and write fo 00 minutes, that is a really really long time. Well I am also thinking that I am fivxing to go to aerobics from 0:00 to 00:00 and not only is it late but it is also going suck. But I need to get into shape. I am worried that if I don't go and excersise I am going to gain that dreaded freshman 00 which will not at all be cool. I come fram a town of 00,000 and everyone knows everyone and all their business so I am sure that if I go home whith any added pounds everyone will notice, and most likely comment. Well I just looked at the clock and I realized that I have only been typing for four minutes, and this really scares me because I do not want to get cramps in my hands. I hate to type, because I am not very good at it and on top of that I do not use very good grammar or punctuation, even after I checked and rechecked my work. So it does worry me that I will have to turn this assignment in unrevised. I cannot get itout of my head how weird I think this assignment is MY friend is now leaning over my shoulder trying to read the assignment and she is making me very nervous. i can not stand to be nervous. The girl next to me just call the little whistle on her screen which notifies her of new mail, and I was thinking that I love it when I hear that noise. Earlier before I started this assignment I checked my e-mail and I had one new message from my friend PROPNAME who goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I was so excited to hear from him he is one of my really good friends. the lady that is in charge of the computer station just made this girl show her, her id and when she asked for it she was not very nice. Which makes me think of the fact that I very strongly dislike people who are rude when they are providing a serviece to you. I mean it is like they are getting paid to do this so I do not know why a little common courtesy is so hard to come by, I am getting really bored with this assignment because I am having a hard time concentrating on typing while at the same time letting things naturally flow into my thoughts. But I guess that you are used to that, I am like also wondering why I am acting like you are actually going to read this because I know that you are not and it seems stupid to sit here and just jabber about nothing, someone else just got the e-mail alarm and once again I am reminded of my most recent message, which I was very excited about, my friend next to me is the one I go to aerobics with and she is already all dressed in her aerobics outfit ready to go. she just interrupted me again to ask me for the instructions on how to get here, I do not like to be bothered when I am in the middle of doing somthing, but I have found that it is very not to be bothered when you are living in a small space with someone, because no matter how quiet they are trying to be they never seem to be quiet enough, I know glanced at the clock again and I realize that at max I only have to type for 0 more minutes which excites me very much. My fingers are cramping and I am getting very old with this assignment I am hoping that the next assignment will not be timed but I am under the impression that with my luck that is am improbability, I feel sorry for my friend she just started the assignment and she has no idea what she has gotten herself into, I cannot wait until she is done so I can ask her what she thought about. WEll MY TIME IS UP!!! 
__label__label1 I am so completely upset with my mother. We used to be so close and now she has turned evil on me!  She's mad about my cell phone bill, well then why did she buy it for me?  I called her the majority of the time anyway. It's not like I was calling PROPNAME or PROPNAME!  I think I- aggh, she seriously thinks I have nothing better to do up here then listen to her bitch about money. I'm trying to earn a college education so I don't have to worry about money. Not that a degree will magically erase all of life's problems, but it will always let me have something to fall back on. I wish I didn't have so much to do. I have a t least 0 chapters to read for each class, and I overslept this morning, so I missed Geography! Oops, I'm seriously not too interested in how the prehistoric man evolved into what we are today, but it seems rather important that I memorize it all now for the sake of the essay test yet to come. What's that all about anyway, essaytests?  Why not just give mc tests like the rest of the world? How boring would that be to read 000 essays over geography? Feel kinda bad for that man. I think that college should come with a scheduled in nap time. Everyone gets tired, it should just be one extra hour where you take your mat and blanket just like in kindergarden and go to your assigned building and sleep! If you show up you get a C if you doze off and on you get a B and if you knonk out you get an A!  Sounds good doesn't it!  It could count as an elective, and those with the hardest classes and the furthest to walk would get to register first!  I'm so smart I scare myself!! Just kidding, well. I still need to find brown shoes. Brown dress shoes, I have this brown dress to wear to this 00th anniversary party, and I don't have shoes!  I feel kinda like the girl in clueless. ohmygod, no shoes whatever will I do?  Seriously, after I enactmy nap time plan, I am going to create a brown dress shoe company. I will make a fortune, because I will be the only person in the world that makes brown shoes!  One day. I have a monster headache, I think it's my contacts, I should probably change them, has it been two weeks? I don't think so!  I'm a responsible person, I just forget to do things sometimes! I had to got to the postoffice today. That was neat. I had no idea what I was doing and I felt like a dumb teenage girl who had never been in any sort of public "Official" place. I'll try to stay away from there. Well it's been 00 min! Goodbye!    
__label__label0 What should I write. hmmm well I'm kinda feeling tired right now and hungry. Went bolwing till about 0 am last night and havent really had anything to eat yet. In about an hour me and a few people from the dorm are going out to a LOCNAME restaurant to eat since all the cafeterias are closed for dinner on sunday. I hear people talking in the hallway about going to play paint ball on monday. I think I am going to go. I've never played paint ball but I've heard it's pretty cool. Hopefully it wont last that long because I was planning on doing some reading for my classes. something always comes up to keep you from studying. oh and I have calculus homework to do also. damn. my calculus teacher is French and has not mastered the English language but really who has in the mathematics department. Tuesday is a busy day so I don't think ill get much done then. all the clubs I signed up for meet on Tuesday. there are five days in the week and lets say take out friday to make four possible days to have a meeting and they all choose the same day. just my luck. Ill just have to choose which oraganization seems the best. hm well is my 00 minutes up. yup 
__label__label1 I feel very tired and alone. My room is too quiet to sleep, if that is possible and I don't have anyone to talk to since my roomate is out of town. The fan is on high right now to try to create some noise and keep me cool and comfortable, but the mugginess and isolation are too much to allow me to get any meaningful rest. It seems as though me clothes are permanently stuck to my chest and back. There is hardly any noise in my room besides the sound of the fan and the typing sound of my keyboard. I like to type as fast as possible so that the keys make almost a musical harmony. Besides the occasional loneliness, I am very happy with my new life here at college. My ex-girlfriend from high school came in for the weekend to see me, and I had a great time. however, I don't think that I would like for her to come to college with me. She goes to ORGNAME and although I don't get to see her as much as I would like, I think that I saw her too much when we were together. It makes for sort of an awkward situation, but I have a lot of freedom, and at the same time, quite a bit of security knowing that she still cares about me and loves me. I don't like to say goodbye to her, though. She holds me and kisses me all weekend, but when it is time to go, she gets more depressed than she was when she hadn't seen me for weeks. Sometimes I get scared about her being so home-sick. She stopped eating for a while, but only told me about it today. It made me upset to think of someone who was too upset about college to eat. Everyone ends up saying college is the best time of their life, so I think that people should just forget about being homesick and try to get to the fun stuff as soon as possible. I like to have my own place, my own stuff, and a new group of friends. For the first time in my life, I can use self-control and discipline which I lacked back in high school. Back then, I figured that my parents could try to catch me if they could, but here, it's either be smart or lose out on a great opportunity to get an education and make connections. My parents do still have some say in my behavior though. They are the ones that tote most of the bills for me and recently rejected my request to join a fraternity. I was really excited to get my bid and go through the pledge stuff, knowing all along that my parents would make me wait out the first semester until joining. I wanted to make some new friends outside of the ten or so good friends that came here from high school with me. Oh well, I guess that parents know best, and I didn't challenge them too much with this decision. I'm sure that I could still join today, with the use of a little charm and a minor guilt trip. But, they are probably right on this one, so I'll let them win. The weather here seems to give me frequent nose-bleeds, unless I am just picking it more than usual (a little humor even though no one but me is listening). I love to joke around about things. The nose bleeds may be caused by some sort of anxiety or stress about being in a new place. I used to wake up with them all the time when I first moved from LOCNAME to LOCNAME. I thought that it was the driness, but now that I have them again, you can't help but wonder. Time seems to go by quickly when I get to ramble on about life and myself. Does that mean that I am arrogant or self centered, that's probably it. The phone just rang and got me off track, but it's about time to go anyways. I try to correct all my mistakes during this writing even though I know that I don't have to. The work of good teachers or just a perfectionist, you make the call. Actually, I think that the bloody nose may have come from being hit during a game of basketball the other day. Maybe it is just a coincidence. Psychologists always over examine things I think. The answer the usually right in front of their nose, but they think about it too much and get too deep. Was that a pun? 
__label__label0 I think college is going to be the best part of my life. Coming from my high school, it seemed hopeless to find a place where I'd fit in. LOCNAME has such a wide diversity of people and so many ways to meet new people, that I think, I will have no problem finding someone like me. Of course, right now, I'm still a little shy about talking to people but hopefully that will change. I really want to join a soroity and become active in as many Hispanic and other multicultural events or projects as my schedule will allow. Maybe this will help me find the kind of people that can relate to me. Even though I only know a couple of people on campus, I feel more comfortable there than I ever did in high school.          Outside of school, things are good at home. I have all the love and support than I can ever ask for from my family. Without them I don't know where I'd be. I love them very much. I don't know why I can't tell them that. I guess I'm just too stubborn. I also get a lot of support from my boyfriend. Even though I didn't really want a boyfriend, I'm glad he's there. He brings a lot of fun to my life. I hope school doesn't take away my time for him. I know its going to though, ecspecially if I join all the organizations that I want.            Overall,I'm satisfied with everything. I know its going to be a long and hard four years, but I'm looking forward to walking the stage with an engineering major.           
__label__label1 Right now I am sitting at home checking my email and different things. A lot of things are running through my head. I need to read for my classes, I need to go to work, and I need to clean the house. I am interested in this psychology class and I like Dr. PROPNAME a lot. He is funny and keeps class interesting. I look forward to class and believe that I will learn a lot. My sensations at the moment include being extremely tired. I am worried about getting everything done and think that I have to much to do. I am very happy it is the weekend and am so glad I don't have class on Friday and this weekend on Monday. I am excited about this weekend because my small town is having a picnic and they are always a lot of fun. I am sorry that I will miss the ORGNAME football game against ORGNAME but the last one I went to was extremely hot and I was drenched with sweat. I had a lot of fun in spite of the heat though. I love the spirit of the fans and feel proud that I attend a university with so much pride and support. I love to be amidst the fans and hear the roar of the games in general. I saw so many burnt orange shirts in the stands that I couldn't believe it. It is almost solid burnt orange with an occassional white or some other color shirt. I don't need to buy any more UT clothing, etc. I have to much stuff already, but every time I go into the bookstore I buy something with UT on it. I feel sorry for whoever has to read this or check it over because it is boring and I don't even know if I am doing this right. I am just writing what I am thinking and it is turning out to be a cool assignment. I think it has been about twenty minutes so I am going to end the assignment. I enjoyed this and it helped me to write these things out. It felt like I was talking to someone who was a very good listener, even though it was a computer screen and  no one will probably read it anyway.   
__label__label0 ok I begin writing now without thinking about the writing that I'm doing this is so eird why do this why proffessor make us do this will he be reading what we're writing or not and will he be able to see what I'm thinking by just reading. will it offer insight into what my mind works like is it going to help him see what kind of person that I am I miss jun where is she where was she last night I want to have sex with her I want to have a relationship with hertooo this is weird I'm writing dowwn exactly what I'm thinking and it all comes so fast I'm not even thinking like I normally think usually there' ssome kind of method to the way that I do it but now I'm just writing and I'm not even having complete thoughts leading to ideas and resolutions now I want to shift thinking so that I can do some productive thinking or maybe not waste time but I'm stuck on this and I guess I should do what the assignment says jun makes a sound that's so sexy when I lick her earlobe it makes me want to fuck her wow I wonder if anyone will read that and think I'm some kind of pshycho this is so weird I shouldn't care what I write, but my name's on this so I have to worry but I'm sick of worrying about things that's why I drink so that nothing matters that's why I like smoking pot because no worries that's not why I like to have relationships with girls though that's more psychological and I think thati have these relationships because its something to put my energy into to figure out that I'm not into damn I just stopped accidentally owh well now its time for a new stream I need to do this work so that I can get my good grades so that I can get into good school so I can make good money so I can have happy life so I'll be happy but so often to do this I have to do things that make me unhappy I like this classbut not some of my other classes like english where the teacher's a bitch and where I spend the whole time looking at jun because she's a beautiful girl and I want her why do so many of my thoughts concern sex and lust annd anger and fear and worry it would be easier to eliminate the last three this isn't really stream of consciousness writing because I'm actually being much more random in my thoughts than I usually amn so this assignment doesn't make any sense I wonder if thy use this for any psychoanalytical purpose I wonder if other people's writing is similar to minee in any way I guess so since there are fundamental similarities between all human brains and minds that can't be overcome and I'm not that diffeerent from others in that respect I wish I was more like others but not sacrificing the things that are important to me I wish I had a steady girlfriend that always makes me much happier I just met jun and hooked it up with herand now I don't understand the rlationship and don't know if it'll continue and that's frustrating because I want it to and at the same time don't because she's dkind of a slut and might ahve a disease but I lust for her and she's the only girl who's paid me any attention so I really want to have a relationship with her though I'll prbably get hurt and feel like I should never have done it and then I'll be sad again but for now I'm happy when I'm with her and I feeel good when I'm with her and its good I'm still worried that I think about hers o much and that someone will read this that's why these tests are total crap because I have to spend so much time worrying about what the shrink thinks because I ahve this facade to put up for some reason although it won't affect my grade and it won't affect my relationship because I probably won't ever see him agaian and I won't have to face him but STILL I worry why do I do that what am I so afraido of revealing and why ami so afraid of people really knowing what's inside am I that evil and suppressing that much of myself that its making me put up a false front that I think everyone should see why do I opress ok this is really weird I'm starting to get very introspective this is probably not what I was supposed to todo but oh well now I'll be able to keep typing I forgato my ttrain of thought my typing is becomeing more and more flawed because I'm mjust closing my eyes and letting it all flow out on paper fuck jun I'm letting it go I hte something I love something I'm getting in tough cwith emotions I want women I like them they smell good this is funny to whoever reasds this oh well laugh because I guess it really is maybe I'll read it myself afterwords and have a good giggle at myself and maybe that's the point of life to be comfortable withwho you are and what goes on in your head its almost time to stop althought I was just getting very interested int he results and in to what I was writing times up. 
__label__label1 This is my first actual assignment ORGNAME college so far. I've gotten all the homework assignments and practice problems, but this is the first one thORGNAME really counts. At least it is the first assignment that I know of that really counts. Of course, I'm not exactly sure what the professor is looking for, but I'm doing my best. I'm just hoping I'll get a good grade for this. So far, I'm having a lot of fun here in the lovely ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. It's a lot of work, but then again, I know it will pay off in the long run. And despite the small forest I've killed so far making flash cards for Spanish and Medical Terminology, its actually kind of fun. I like being busy, and I like doing things that lead to something bigger. In this case, it will hopefully lead to medical school. But that's enough about school, after all, I only live on campus, I'm surrounded by it! I'm in a great mood today and I have no idea why. I'm really hyper, and I didn't really do anything that unusual. I didn't eat an entire bag of Pixy Stix or anything. I did go swimming today, not nearly as much as I used to, but apparently it was enough to actually get some endorphins (if that's right) pumping. Now all I need to do is keep up that routine. I'm wide awake, and ready to go, even it is eight o'clock in the evening, and I have about a dozen other things I should really get around to doing. At least I'm organized though. I didn't really think that would pay off that much in school at least not right away, but it is. I can't wait until my birthday; I'll finally be eighteen! Its kind of funny how much a birthday can mean. Even though it's not that big of a deal, it's still exciting. Although the only thing I can do is go to clubs and join the military, and neither of those are exactly my kind of thing. It'll be nice to have people stopping and being completely amazed that a seventeen year old is actually in college. Will wonders never cease? Oh well, its all fun and games and it means presents! Shallow, but its nice to get things. Especially when you're one of those people who usually manages to remember everyone's birthday, even if it is a few days or weeks late. What matters is that I remember! I just like doing things like that, it makes everyone feel special, as pathetic as that sounds. I feel like this is the most incoherent thing I've ever written. I'm just rambling all over the place, but I hope this is what the professor is looking for. If this is stream of consciousness, I'm amazed anyone can actually read this kind of thing. It would drive me crazy to have to read all this rambling. As completely crazy and illogical as what I have written is, its nice to just be able to switch subjects like mad. It's a nice change from the whole introduction, body, and conclusion type of paper. Still, this style of writing is very refreshing and it's a lot more challenging than I thought. I've never really sat down and tried to follow my thoughts for twenty minutes. I guess I just don't have that much to think about, judging from what I have written. And it's sad because I've actually written a fair amount of absolutely nothing. Who would have guessed I could spend twenty whole minutes just writing this kind of thing? 
__label__label1 Alright, well right now I have no idea what to write. I don't know what my professor is expecting this to say and I do not know what all of the other students are writing about. I don't really want to get too personal just in case I get to be the lucky one who's homework is spotchecked. I am worrying that school is not being focused on as much as it should be. I sometimes think that I am going to be able to get by as easily as I did in high school when at the same time I know that that is not the case at all. I know that I am going to have to study so much more than I ever have and it freaks me out. Especially since I am not so sure that I know exactly how to study. I don't want to go into an exam thinking that I know all the information and then have no clue what the test is saying to me. I want to do so well this semester and in a way I have to if I want to transfer into the school of communications next semester. And the fact that I heard the other day that Professor PROPNAME is the hardest psychology teacher here did not help much. I didn't think he seemed that hard but apparently he is. And I also am freaking out about the whole sorority thing. I am having so much fun with it but it is taking up a lot of my time and so are all of the parties that go with it. I have to decide whether or not I want to go home on Saturday for the night. I want to see my parents and my friends but I don't know if it is worth it. And also I don't want to get really sad when I am there. I am worried that I am not going to really want to come back. That is not saying that I am not having such a fun time here but I think that me not wanting to come back after a night at home is a possibility. I am having so much fun here but it is a lot of stuff to deal with sometimes. And it is like I am never capable of being alone. And when I am alone, its when I don't really want to be alone. There are always things going on and people around when I just want to relax and sit down. But that is never possible. And there is so much to do all the time that studying is so hard to fit into my schedule. But I do have to admit that I am studying because I know I am more than some of my friends. Friends is another thing that kind of scares me. I hope that my best friends from home and I don't lose touch just because there are so many new faces here and everyone is wanting to meet new people. I just kind of wish that I knew who my group of friends is going to be so that I can start hanging out with them and making memories that are going to count. Okay, well I hope that this is what you expected from my 00 minutes of writing because I had no idea what else to write. Now maybe you can look at the way my brain works and help me deal with my problems. 
__label__label0 I miss my guitar. I wish that I had brought one of them with me. I have to be sure to bring my amp and at least one guitar, maybe two of them back from home this weekend. That kind of sucks though, that I let mom borrow the one I really want to bring with me. I am glad though that she taking lessons. Maybe I could teach her some PROPNAME. I hope she helps PROPNAME pay for that car she wants. But PROPNAME also wants to get it repainted, because she just doesn't like the color. Oh well, I'm glad PROPNAME is getting that car, ORGNAME's are real safe. I should know, I've totaled enough of them. That scares me though, because kids have wrecks, and I've already lost a cousin, I don't know what I would do if I lost my sister. At least they're safe cars. I hope I can get a car for Christmas. I know I totaled a bunch of cars, but I was also an addict when I was in all of those wrecks, and I'm better now, it could be a reward. My doctor is really proud of me. When I told him that I had been clean for 000 days, he was very proud and said that "a lot of times adults can't even do that, so you must be an adult. " I was happy about that. I just wish that my dad was as proud, and understanding of how hard this is, and what a real accomplishment this is. 
__label__label1 Ok, 00 minutes. To start off, I should probably write a little longer than 00 minutes. If I only write for 00 minutes, you're not going to get very much. That's because my typing skills are way below even pitiful, much less below average. The reason for that is that I'm twice as old as most of the rest of the students in this class, and consequently did not grow up using a computer as they did. As a matter of fact, there weren't any computers at all in my high school. The only computers that the entire school district had were the ones that counted holes in punch cards. I took all my first standardized tests by punching holes in cards. Those were probably the only computers in the entire city. Wait, that's not true; some of the most advanced computers in the entire world were probably there. I grew up in LOCNAME, which is where the ORGNAME plant is located. ORGNAME(although they'll never admit it, it's common knowledge) is the final assembly point for all the nuclear weapons for the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Just a wild guess, but they probably had some pretty cool computers out there. What else? oh, I hope I can just write this here and hit submit, because being technostupid, I don't have a clue as to how to do any of that cutandpaste black magic. As a precautionary measure, I'm going to print it up. If it doesn't go through, I'll have to paper your office with printed copies and bother you with emails. OK, how long has it been? 00 minutes. My guess is that after 00 minutes, most of those folks will have come up with with 00 times what I have here. I hear them over in the computer center at the UGL with their flying fingers. Damned showoffs. But enough about me. Tell me about yourself. Never mind. Bad joke The next thing that pops up sort of relates to that first stuff. What in the hell is an old fart like me doing in a university in the first place? Well, I really, really screwed it up the first time. I couldn't be bothered to go to class back then; I had dope to deal. Well, it was the early 00s, there was a lot of that going on. So when I got fed up and pissed off in the job I had, I decided to look for a new job. Being tired of the whole restaurant business, I looked through the entire classified section, only to find that everyone wanted you to have a degree. It didn't have to have anything to do with what they did, they just wanted you to have one. The ad that tore it for me was for some retail place in the mall, I can't even remember which one, listed only 0 qualifications: a college degree, and the ability to lift 00 pounds. @#%$&&^%! So here I am. Now it's 00 minutes. See what I mean? I just did a quick division since that last timecheck and using the number of lines, it comes to about 0000 words a minute. I'm surprised the keyboard's not smoking. I'll go on for a couple of minutes more here. You probably haven't had nearly enough boring stuff to read today. Now I'm stretching to find things to say. Was that the point of this deal? To prove that more than 00 minutes of sustained thought was too much to sustain? If so I've more than proved the point here. Even 00(well, getting close to 00 now) has proved to be a stretch. Enough. I'm sending this thing. I hope you get it. 
__label__label0 Here I am in college. It's pretty weird and scary all at the same time. PROPNAME is in LOCNAME, he says that he is in love with me now that he is away from me. I on the other hand have pulled away. He was so controlling and bad to me in high school that it is hard for me to turn away now that he is so nice and perfect. I love him very much, but I've met another guy who is so perfect in everyway. He is so nice and understanding, some much more than I've ever experienced. Mom is coming today. Yesterday was my birthday so she is coming today to take me to eat and bring me some presents. I am so tired, I was up until 0 this morning, she is going to think I'm sick. I don't know how I made it to my morning classes. On Fridays I am done by 00 am! That is so nice. I kind of miss my friends back home. It's hard to having friends that don't understand you completely yet. I love texas! 
__label__label0 Just got home in LOCNAME. It's a 0 and a half hour drive. Thought everything is just going to be fine when suddenly a lady who pulled her car behind me bumped into the back bumper of my car. I pulled to the side and got out of the car. She got out too and I looked at my bumper just a few scratches. I let her go. I am in a hurry! I have a doctors appointment at 0pm and there is no time to waste not to mention this writing assignment is due at 0pm. there goes my afternoon! This is been a busy week and a depressing one. I knew I was going to see PROPNAME at the ORGNAME meeting but somehow I knew even though I didn't want to see her. I still ended up saying hi to her. What is wrong with me!?!?! I should have just skipped it. I should have also not forced PROPNAME to go into the CSA meeting room. I think she got a little mad at me. I didn't really care. She said she saw PROPNAME and she doesn't want to go in there and let him see her. She is afraid that he would say something to PROPNAME or PROPNAME or those dumb losers. Even though they were my high school friends, I still think PROPNAME has changed. Well people change. What can I say? I changed for the worst. Does anyone change for the best???? Sometimes I wish I would have made some choices that are good and the outcome would be better. But I end up making the bad ones that I am regretting. Oh well. my friend PROPNAME is messaging me again on I'M maybe it's time to go. Mom is coughing I hope she is ok. She said she is sick because of the car accident. I wonder how bad it was. It was my fault. I shouldn't have left so early that afternoon so they had to take my brother back to LOCNAME. You see another bad choice of mine. What can I say!?!?!. I am speechless really want to change radically. Stop smoking stop procrastinating daydreaming live for the present??? 
__label__label1 I am feeling anxious about my philosophy class that I have in 00 minutes. the class in which I have not attended yet due to a schedule change. I hope they haven't been assigned a large amount of work yet so that I won't have too much catching up to do. I hope that there isn't going to be an exam on one of the days I'm going to be out of town. I've already had to email professor pennebaker about missing an exam because I will be out of town for my sister's wedding. I wonder what it will be like for my sister after she is married. I hope everything works out for her. I wonder if the person I marry I already know, or if I have yet to meet them. I need to figure out where and how to pay for the classes I added/dropped, I need to do this soon. I hope that when I have to connect flights in st. louis it all goes well and is easy, since I've never had to connect before. it will be worth it though because I'll get to see my sister who I haven't seen in a very long time. I need to go to the rowing meeting tonight, but I'm afraid if I commit to it I won't have enough time to study. also, I'm going to miss 0 days of tryouts because I'll be out of town. it sure seems like going out of town is causing me to miss a lot of things, but my sister is important to me and being a part of her wedding will be very special. I need to go do some reading for my rhetoric class before I have to leave for philosophy. I hope I like this class, or else I switched out of sociology for nothing. 
__label__label0 Today was very interesting. So much to do, though, with so little time. Study, work, and just living has become harder than expected. I miss the comfort zone I enjoyed while living at home. Oh, home, what a distant thought that now seems to be. I miss my parents, but I don't really miss my sisters. Yes, I miss my Mom's cooking. More importantly, however, I miss her reassurance and soothing smile every day. The daily smile is a luxury I no longer enjoy. My roommate hardly every smiles and when he does it's far from comforting. I guess a big part of me is homesick. This is such a large school with so many people, I feel overwhelmed. It is especially hard living off campus and not having the ability to be in an environment where you meet new people on a daily basis. Here at the apartment, everyone keeps to themselves. They've already made friends with people during the freshman year or live with their best friends. I, however, am not that lucky. I don't really know too many people and I didn't even know my roommate before I moved here. But, I have this thought that some beautiful, charming young lady will soon save me from this pit of despair. I think I'm at a point in my life where love needs to prosper. I've never been one for steady, or healthy, relationships but the loneliness I'm currently enduring makes a girlfriend seem very tempting. Love is, after all, what makes the world go around or is it? I've been so independent and so bottled up for so long, I don't know whether this cold heart can be warmed up for love and I surely don't want to break anyone's heart. I've done enough of that and learned my lesson a long time ago. There's just so much beauty in this world. I find myself drifting off almost hourly with the vision of some really hot girl. I lived in a town that might have had ten goodlooking girls, so you can imagine how surprised I've been walking the LOCNAME campus. Nothing could have possibly prepared me for the beauty littered around the campus and PROPNAME as well. There are so many girls and so few guys; it hardly seems fair. But I'm in no way complaining. It's like I'm the guy in American Beauty whose heart aches because it sees so much beauty around it. That's me in a nutshell. I see all these gorgeous girls walking around and I freeze. I don't know what to do because I've never been in a situation quite like this. Tomorrow is a new day and the future is bright. I find myself waiting for some girl to fall helplessly into my lap, but I need to wake up and face reality. If I want to find a great girl I need to initiate conversation and go from there. Wish me luck! 
__label__label1 Right now I am feeling good because today is Friday. So far I have really enjoyed my first week of school. I like all my classes so far, and I am embracing the whole college experience. I am also happy because I am going home to LOCNAME today. It has only been a week since I left but I already miss my house and especially my parents. Right actually I do not have anything on my mind. I am pretty tired because I slept late last night and had a fairly early class. In fact, right now sleep would be really good. Well my stomach is also talking to me so I am also hungry. I have not eaten yet today. I am actually eating less in college since I seem to be always busy and always on the run. I like it though because maybe then I can lose some weight. Another thing in my mind is how complicated computers are. I never was really into computers in high school and now in college I have to constantly use it. I wish I was better with computers because I really think it is useful and is part of everybody's daily lives. I think the reason why I do not care for the computer much is because due to my impatience. I cannot really tolerate having to go in circles to find what I really want. For example this assignment would already have been done last night but for some reason I could not get into the website. However, I am glad I am finally able to finish my work after several tries late last night. I think it is quite interesting how a lot can be said about a person through their writing because right now it seems that I am rambling and to be honest I do not think that there's anything logical in my head right now. I am not really thinking about anything but what to write for this assignment, if that made any sense. My brain is just telling me to think of something to write. Actually I am also anticipating for the time to be up. Twenty minutes can be long when you do not have much to say. Speaking of waiting for the time to pass by, it has been twenty minutes. I am finally done. 
__label__label0 I don't really want to go to my BA000 class today. Sleep sounds so good right now. I don't think I have enough energy to sit through another hour and half class, since this morning I sat through three of them in a row. Oh yeah I better remember to call PROPNAME so we can go study at the ORGNAME or FAC. I don't know if I want to study with a whole group of people but maybe I'll give it a try. This is so cool. Getting graded on a writing assignment that is of our thoughts and feelings. Reminds me of my summer English 0000 class that I took where we had to write journals everyday and as long as we did them and turned them in it was ok. It is sooo freaking hot outside. And I am so tired, mainly because of the heat. Hmmm. I wonder if PROPNAME has called. I feel so bad for her. Anyways, that is kind of depressing just thinking about it. I feel so stressed out. These first three weeks at ORGNAME has been busy. Not with work and stuff but with things like getting everything together and making sure that I have insurance, my checking account is correct and other important things. I miss the home food so much! But I'll live, it's not too bad over here. I haven't seen any guys here. Hahah! Well I have but I don't think I will end up dating any right now. My hands are getting so tired right now. I really feel like sleeping. I think after BA000 I will go to eat at PROPNAME and then head to the library or something. These labs and libraries on campus are so good. They have everything and you can use them whenever. PROPNAME should be coming next Thursday to that Career Day thing so hopefully I'll see her. I am so confused on what to go into, like majors and stuff. I'm thinking about MIS but marketing sounds so good right now. Like I'm more interested in that kind of stuff and things that I really would enjoy doing. I know it doesn't have a lot of money or anything, but that is not what is important really to me. I mean yeah I want to earn a good living but that's not my main goal in life to be rich more like be happy. So I don't know. Just a confused freshman I guess!. Maybe I'll find out pretty soon. Man this time is going by so slowly. I've only been writing for ten minutes. Just realized how many thoughts flow through my mind in such small amount of time. Man I hope I get a chance to do a project because I do not want to write a paper. That sounds too boring. Being a part of an experiment sounds so cool, never really done that before. Ok I wish I had my headphones, too like the girl next to me. I need to listen to some music. I wonder if we are all going to go out this Thursday night to sixth street. I kind of want to. I feel so bad for PROPNAME, cause of her roommate. She is kind of mean, actually she is very rude and catches an attitude with every little thing. Even if she does not know you, she'll be so rude. Dang girl. Hahah. Ok well I need to find where my BA000 class is so I will be going now. So much for this writing assignment! I think my twenty minutes are up. Well actually they are almost up. But it said at least. Oh well I guess I'll go anyway. 
__label__label1 Well, hello Mr. Paper. I am so happy to be here writing about what is on my mind. Where should I start. "Start", isn't that a funny word. About as funny as the guy next door because he is singing to some girly song. Well, this might be pretty long because I type pretty fast. My eyes are so tired. Sometimes I think my mind purposely pushes my eyelids down, hinting at me that I need to keep them shut for more than a few hours. Sometimes when I take deep breathes it hurts. "Why?" you ask. Well it is a long story. It doesn't hurt, but it puts a sharp pain in my left shoulder due to my car accident ( I won't get into it). So, I am a college student now. What does that exactly mean? I think it means I can finally be myself. I don't have to worry about what my parents will think. There is only one restriction still holding my true self down. My girlfriend that I still have, even though she doesn't even go to school here. She lives all the way over in LOCNAME, and I can't stand the way things are. I say that I am in love with her, but is that true when I am so happy to be away from her? Anyways, I say "restriction" because that is what she is right now. I literally have to check in with her, and she has to know everything I do. So I guess in a way I didn't get away from my parents. She took their place. So, I figure that as long as she is in LOCNAME, and completely attached to me, I have to have my fun here and then lie to her. I know it sounds bad, but if I were to tell her what I actually do here, I would have to spend endless amounts of hours on the phone with her because she would be so upset. OK, I am sick of talking about this. The women at this University are the most amazing I have ever seen. And I guess that is why I am having such a hard time with my girlfriend. I have never seen so many good looking women. I feel like I am in a candy store. And it helps that I am a good looking guy, because I get their attention. That sounds conceited, but I am an honest man. I know that some women are attracted to me, and I am attracted to many women. Also, I am highly flirtatious, so my girlfriend gets real scared with me being here. I just tell here all the girls are ugly. I brought a camera to school. I have some incriminating photos on that thing. I need to get those developed and locked away. Nothing too bad, but bad enough to get me in trouble with my girlfriend. You see, why does everything come back to her. I hate it. I don't want to have to worry about a relationship right now! But what do I do? I respect and love her too much to hurt her. So, I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to do. Yet another thing I should be having to do. I just want to be here at college, go to class, study, meet people, have fun, and NOT worry about a relationship. Seriously, I have to get off this. Let's change the subject. I want to talk about cheese. Cheese is really weird. It comes from a cow, but how does it get to be cheese. I know there is an answer, but it is still a mystery in my mind. And then where do the holes come from? Are they bubbles of air, or did they just appear there, or did some kind of bug eat the cheese away? Swiss is my favorite. American is horrible. It just shouldn't be allowed. to be made. Cheddar is enjoyable. There are no other cheeses as far as I am concerned. They go great on hamburgers. With lettuce and mayo and ketchup, I can have myself a meal. Well, it is late and those little demons keep pushing my eye lids down, so I will end it here. It was wonderful to type on this lovely screen! 
__label__label0 The past two weeks have been extremely stressful. There has been so much going on, it has been hard for me to keep up with school work. I have not found much time for me to go out and relax. Although, I believe that the stress I have encountered is being relieved. As the school year progresses I think I will be able to juggle school, work and my friends. I have been getting a lot sleep. Even though I get plenty of sleep I still wake up in the mornings feeling tired and worn out. I don't know why, but I think I might be because I have been getting too much sleep! I think that is one of the main reasons I haven't been keeping up with my school work. This might also be the reason why I am stressed out. I have been so busy trying to catch up with the reading in philosophy. I went through provisional so I did not really get a summer vacation. So I want to slack off, but I know I cant. I do believe as time progresses I will be less stressed.

__label__label1 As I start my third semester at LOCNAME, I feel both excited and a little overwhelmed at once. First of all, I'm excited because this is probably the first semester that I feel truly comfortable with my life here. I am living with my sister which is so good for me. We get along really well and I really enjoy spending as much time with her as I can. Also, my exboyfriend is at LOCNAME with me now. He is now one of my best friends and it means so much to me that we are able to spend so much time together now. But fortunately the time that we did not spend together last year (because he was still in high school) was good for me as well. It enabled me to find out who I was before and become a more independent person before he came to join me here at LOCNAME. Because of our time apart, I made lots of new friends and was able to have a lot of fun even without him. So, this year, I not only have him with me, but I also have all the friends that I made last year so that I don't depend only on him. My best friend, unfortunately is not in such a good situation. Her boyfriend came to LOCNAME this year as well, but because he was away from her last year, she spent very little time at UT meeting new people and getting to know the campus and the city. She spent most of her time in LOCNAME visiting him. As a result, this year, she spends all of her time with her boyfriend and associates with very few other people. Although, I know that she's really happy right now that her boyfriend is here with her, I realize that if something happens to her relationship with him, she will be left with very few friends to turn to. Since she made such little effort last semester to develop such friendships, I fear that she will feel really isolated if she is left without him. She barely even talks to me much anymore because she is so involved with him. But I try to hold this against her because I know that she is not trying to ignore me, but she just really enjoys spending time with her boyfriend. But other than that, I'm really happy with my social situation right now. It is a really good thing that I have this support of all my friends at this time, because I realize that this is probably going to be one of the hardest semesters of my college career. I am taking 0 architecture classes in addition to this psychology class. Three of these classes involves building models, drawing orthographics, and designing. Two of them involve large amounts of reading and writing papers. In the first week, I already am swamped. Although I know myself well enough to know that I will definitely finish all my projects, somehow I still stress out about them a bit, just thinking of all the work that they will involve and worrying about how many latenighters I will have to pull (especially when I think of the fact that I have 0:00 classes every day of the week!). And I would love to work this semester to earn some money to pay for all the projects that I will have to build because I know how expensive they get. But, I realize that with the huge load I have so far, working is almost impossible for me. If I could have my way though, I would work at a restaurant in town. I worked at ORGNAME's over the summer and I really loved waiting tables. I met so many great friends and it was fun meeting new guests and serving them. I think the reason I loved it so much was definitely because of all the people I met. There were mostly guys that I worked with and they were all so friendly to me. We would always talk during the shifts and then go out for drinks after work. I got to know lots of them very well and even dated one for sure. It was really great meeting people that in many ways were very different than me. It gave me new perspectives and taught me new things about myself. 
__label__label1 Okay, I am starting to write for this assignment. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write, but I guess it's sort of like a journal and I'm supposed to write whatever I am thinking. I am kind of overwhelmed by school right now. It is so big here, and it's kind scary. I'm used to knowing everyone around, but here I don't know anyone. Friends is on right now. It's pretty funny. I miss being in LOCNAME where everything is normal. I'm not used to the times shows come on here. This sounds really stupid, like I am just rambling on about nothing. Friends is funny. Am I doing this right? I don't know if this is what y'all are asking me to do. I miss PROPNAME, the guy I am dating from LOCNAME. I don't really want anything serious with him, but I like him a lot so I am kind of confused on what I should do. Should I have my fun and not date someone I really like a lot, or should I date him and maybe miss out on opportunities to have fun at school. I don't know I am not sure. And then there is my exboyfriend PROPNAME. I don't want to be with him, but sometimes I miss him. I think it is only when I think back on high school I think about the good times we had and I miss that. I also don't like it that maybe I made the wrong choice in not wanting him and moving on. What if I totally regret it in the future, and I want him back, but he doesn't want me. That would be horrible. I don't know. I'm just pretty confused right now. I don't know what I want about anything. It's hard getting used to everything around here. I miss the show 00000. I was just thinking about it for some weird reason. That used to be my favorite show, but it got cancelled. I'm supposed to go to a frat party tonight but I don't know if I'm going to go or not. My roommate doesn't want to go cause she needs to do work. She's the same major as me. She's a pretty good influence on me. She gets me to go to meetings and stuff that I probably wouldn't go to if it weren't for her dragging me to them. I am filming the volley ball game on Saturday for a live broadcast. I'm glad I am getting involved somehow. I tried to get tickets to the OU game, but I couldn't they were already sold out when I was supposed to get them. I'm pretty bored right now. I probably have lots of grammar mistakes in here, but since I'm free writing, I don't think it really matters. At least I hope it doesn't matter. I'm a little scared about grades. I hope tests and stuff are not too hard. I'm not really thinking about anything right now, so I have nothing to right except that I have nothing in my head. This is a little hard; to right only what you are thinking and not thinking of something to write. I'm glad it rained today, it was nice. I love the rain. Ever since I was a life guard I have loved the rain, cause we got to close the pool and sit around getting paid for doing nothing a miss those days, back in the summer of my freshmen year. Everything was so easy back then, it kind of makes me sad thinking about it, but oh well, I guess I'll make new memories, and have a different kind if fun. Okay, well my time is up. 
__label__label1 Right now I feel like there must be something more important that I could be doing. That's not to say that what I'm doing right now is unimportant, but I feel that there is something more imperative looming. I feel like I need to clean my room because all of my clutter is getting annoying to look at. I feel like I brought to many things with me to college in order to ensure my comfort, but all these things are only making me more uncomfortable by their presence. Tomorrow I have a test in chemistry that I think is going to be really easy. Hopefully it turns out as easy as I think it will. I don't really need any surprises right now. I wonder if the medication I'm taking for my earache is giving me all these rashes or if it's just the less than par level of cleanliness in the mighty LOCNAME LOCNAME. I heard that it's dirtier than LOCNAME LOCNAME but I'm beyond caring. Rat dander and roach feces don't bother me until I see them. The only thing that really nags me about my dorm room is the bed. Who knows what nasty things that old mattress harbors? If I was really anal retentive I wouldn't be able to sleep on it because of the thought of all the stuff that it has probably accumulated over the years, but instead I succumb to fatigue, grimace in disgust, and lay my head down once again. Speaking of which, my head itches. Rat dander, I tell you. In addition to my concern over the probable existence of rat dander is my concern over the obvious existence of dust. I have never seen quite so much dust. They told us that the air conditioning system wasn't working properly and that they were working on it. It appears to work just fine in regards to spewing dust all over my precious things that annoy me so much. I guess I'll just have to buy some eye drops to go along with the calamine lotion for all these rashes I've been getting. I got the last bottle at Jester store. It was sitting there sort of lonely like it didn't belong at all so I just grabbed it up. I scoff at the poor soul who doesn't develop rashes until a few days from now for he will be forced to go elsewhere for calamine. I think my leg rash might be flaring up again. That sucks. I wish I had absolutely nothing that I needed to do right now because then I could just sit in front of the tv watching a movie and scratching my leg. Now that's the life. Too bad I'm bogged down with college and all of this success waiting to happen to sit around and do nothing. And so ends my stream of consciousness as I am much too absorbed in my itchy leg to think any longer. Plus my 00 minutes is up. 
__label__label0 Well, I'm sitting here at my computer right now doing my assignment for psychology I guess I'm really thinking about a lot of things right now, primarily what my plans for the weekend are going to be even though its only Tuesday I am already worried about something that's going to happen several days from now sometimes I get ahead of myself I guess I really like this assignment because I like typing I feel it is one of my strong points but I haven't got to practice much since my high school typing course I was best in the class back then no one was as good a typist as I was there was a really good looking girl that sat next to me in that class her name was PROPNAME PROPNAME is dating someone older than I am right now his name is PROPNAME I don't know what his problem is he is too old for her and she is not even in college I bet he isn't faithful to her at all that is the problem with these frat guys they don't respect anyone but themselves I wish they would take some time off from their drinking sometime and think about who they are really hurting its not fair to the other kids PROPNAME's age not to get a chance to get to know her because she is so caught up with this college guy that isn't even loyal to her what a jerk oh well its not really my problem anyway I'm in college too high school is behind me even though I had a really good time in high school I miss all of my friends we really had some crazy times it seems so long ago that I was sitting in my senior English class staring out the window thinking about life at LOCNAME who would have guesses that when I got to UT I would spend time thinking about what I thought about in high school my friend is in the room right now he is a friend of mine from elementary school he went to the provisional program but didn't make his grades he goes to ORGNAME now and I think he is happy there the classes aren't too difficult, I hear I wish my classes weren't so hard I feel too stressed if I don't make good grades, my parents are going to kill me one thing I just noticed is that I noticed that I am randomly using punctuation I don't know why maybe I punctuate the things that I think are more important to me I guess that's why I'm in psychology maybe I will understand these things one of these days I think I will learn a lot in psych. as well as all my other classes they are all very interesting to me they are all liberal arts classes that will help my degree actually I don't even know my degree yet it will probably be in either government or history because I want to go to law school and my academic advisor said that those majors would be most conducive to my acceptance to a prestigious law school but the thing they said that matters most was my grade point average he said that anyone with a high GPA can get into law school regardless of their major so that was good to hear it took a lot of pressure off of me to make a decision I do not really want to make for a little while anyway both of my parents are lawyers I wonder how much that affected my decision to pursue a career in law I guess I will discover that as well sometime during this course I am very excited to be enrolled in this course I think I will discover a lot about myself well, my twenty minutes is about up I think I am going to order a pizza now I still have not eaten lunch and I am starving. 
__label__label0 I have no idea how to start this, so I'm just going to start typing and discover what happens!. I just got off the phone with my boyfriend, PROPNAME. I miss him a lot, a whole lot. We've just been going out for 0 months last Saturday, but it feels like we've been together forever. I can't imagine my life right now without him. He still lives at home, near LOCNAME, and I don't get to see him as often as I would like, but if it's meant to be it will be. It will be hard, definitely, but it should be worth it. He tells me all the time how he loves me, and how he will marry me. He even asked me last week, well not officially, but he did ask me what I would say if he asked me to marry him right then. I had no clue what to say I was really confused. I'm so unsure of what to do. I miss him so much it's unbelievable. Sometimes I wish I had stayed home to go to college because it's going to be so hard for the next 0 years, maybe 0. All of my friends love him and his friends love me, it's almost too perfect, if that is possible. His parents are my parents and his brother and I have become very close and get along great. I can imagine having them as inlaws. I was always brought up knowing that you never get along with your inlaws, but I don't see how that could happen. This weekend my roommate and I are going home. We've grown up together. I've known her since the second grade and we've been close friends since seventh. I'm glad that I know her. I don't see how people can come to a place like this and get a roommate they've never met before. That would have added a lot of stress to my life. Not like I don't already have enough stress. Actually, college hasn't been as stressful as I imagined it to be. However, I'm sure that will all change as soon as we start having exams and finals. ugh. I'm not looking forward to that! I've always been the kind of person to put more stress in my life than is needed. A couple of my friends pick on me saying I "freak out too easily". But it doesn't feel like it to me. I don't know, maybe they're right! I was raised an only child, until recently. My mother and biological father divorced when I was four and my mom remarried the man I call dad when I was six. My stepfather has 0 sons and one daughter (who is my age). But, they never lived with us they would spend the occasional weekend at our house but not very often was it longer than a weekend. My entire life changed about 0 months ago when my stepbrother PROPNAME moved in. He took over my life. It was crazy. Suddenly he had all of the attention. I know I sound like a jealous brat, but really he did. Not even just from my parents, suddenly he was my boyfriend's best friend. I could not get away from him. I have worked for my dad's company for 0 years, and then all of a sudden he started working there too. My entire life changed in the past 0 months. I gained a brother, left home for college, lost some friends by leaving, gained some friends by coming, and I am now living a totally different lifestyle. 
__label__label0 I wonder if anything is going to come to mind as I am supposed to do this assignment. It is really hard for me to do something when I am put on the spot, such as this assignment asks me to do. What can I possibly write about the 00 minutes I have that will be enough to satisfy the professor. I wonder why there are Braille letters on drivethrough ATM machines. It was a coincidence that I mentioned that to my friend and then in Family Relationships the professor mentioned it. What do I have to do today? I have a crapload of Math that I have been putting off that is due Wednesday. I still have half of it to finish and I swear to myself that I will finish it today, but I know that I will keep on putting it off until I have to stay up most of the night to finish it the day before. I never stay up to late though, unless it is a project that I am really into and I will spend the little time that I have to really do my best on it. On other stuff like Math or something I am less passionate about I won't care what grade I will get, I won't stay up past 0:00am on a project I am not interested in. Ah, a procrastinators life. But well, I am not sure if it will work for me in college. In high school I did just fine, but I am not sure about college. I guess I will have to wait until my first tests to decide if I should change my ways, but looking at it realistically, I probably will not. I always tell myself to do this or change that, and I do for that week but I always know I will go back to being the same thing I try so many countless time to change. I really want to be like my roommate. She studies all the time, but like my friend PROPNAME said yesterday, she is one of those people who really has to try hard to get good grades. She doesn't think I am one of those people, She isn't. But honestly I would not want a doctor that never cracked a book open until the day before a test and made all As to be my doctor. If she ever decides that is what she wants to be. She is always changing her major, but she is going to med school, at least that is what she says. I don't know what I want to be. I am confused. I tell her I want to be a vet, and then she reminds me of the day I almost vomited when ORGNAME, my dog, took a crap in my room. If I can't stand dog crap, how am I going to be a vet. I just realized that I have to pee, but I still have 0 more minutes to write and then check my spelling, I think I am just going to submit it like this, he said so himself that it will be graded if I have done the assignment, not my spelling. I just realized that I have changed the subject. I always to that. Somebody could be talking about homework and I will bust out saying "Look a my new sandals. " I think aloud too much. Oh, yeah. ok. I also said I wanted to be a marine biologist and she reminded me how afraid I am of sharks. I don't know what she is trying to do to me. 
__label__label1 I would guess the only thoughts in my head right now are on weather or not I doing the things I should be. Is the sorority right for me? I really don't like my pledge class that much but I like most of the other girls in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I don't know I'm just so afraid that I've totally missed God's plan for my life. It worries me. What if Pharmacy isn't where I'm supposed to be. I love listening to people's problems and just being there to help them but I don't know what to do with that. Where are my thoughts headed I'm not exactly sure I let my though wonder lots of times and they just kind of go in every direction. Sometimes the end up to will I ever find the guy I'm supposed to marry? I really do wonder that sometimes. He has to be out there somewhere but where? I don't know. I hate watching PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Its really kind of stupid but its not that its stupid its that I want that too. That guy has to be out there somewhere and I just haven't found him yet but I always want a boyfriends it just seems like lots of time I have bad luck finding one. And it seems that everyone here has one all the freaking time. Its annoying I want to find that PROPNAMEtian perfect guy out there for me. Maybe it is Chris but I doubt it. We're just way to different. I don't know. Its crazy being here at college things are so different. I don't know exactly where I'm supposed to be. Hopefully I'll find it soon. I like the things I'm doing but something's wrong. I have doubts anytime I'm not doing them if that what I'm supposed to be doing but then I'm with those people and I have a great time. It's really confusing. I just need to find that close best friends that I haven't quit found yet. And I really can't wait for next summer its going to be a blast. I think God is putting me there for a purpose but what it is I'm not sure. I just can't wait. I just hope by that time I'll know what it is I'm supposed to be doing here and be totally happy. Its like I feel sometimes I'm putting on a show. It's weird. I hate that I'm kind of in a group who went to high school together. It makes it really hard to fit in. I just need to find my group but hopefully I have now with joining PROPNAME PROPNAME. It'll be all good. Its weird I think that with all the moving I've done it changes things here because I'm used to being on my own and finding new people but it seems so far everyone does stuff with people they already knew or stuff. It's weird. I can't wait though to see some of my old friends. It'll be great fun I miss them lots but then I don't either. I just need to find my new group its what I've been waiting for for a while now and I know that group includes a boyfriend. I guess I'm more ready to find that guy than I wanted to admit. Its not like I'm ready to get married just to find him and start getting to know him better. I just want to find my best friend and that best friend will be the man of my dreams who I will marry and I guess I'm just being impatient to meet him. Very quickly. Because it'll be so neat to find him. I can't wait for tonight because I"LL BE going back to church and that's always fun its my favorite thing to do. It's a good thing. And I don't want to go home this weekend but I know I need to so I'm not to happy about that. Its really weird as I am wiring this I'm seeing more into me of feelings that I've tried to hide but I guess are there more than expected. Its funny I don't know what I'm looking for but I need to find it. I have God and I really want to deepen my relationship with him tremendously. I think I'm on the right path for that. I'll get there soon. I just don't know when. I'm so glad though that I found my church home that makes me feel lots better. Really it does. I just know I have a home now. And my Impulse group is great. I know that will be tons of fun. I just can't wait until Wed when we have it again. I think that will be something I'll look forward to each week because its so much fun. And I think I will get along with my group very well. I really miss my grandma lots. She was like my best friend last semester and I could tell her anything. It was nice and I still can except she doesn't write me long email back. I wish she would it would make it better. But that's ok she's still getting the hang of the Internet. Some day she'll learn how to use it and become a pro. I know she will. I hope there isn't anything really wrong with her leg. That wouldn't be good. I'm sure there's not but you never know and she loves to hide it form everybody which is bad because what if there is something really wrong. IT doesn't do any good to hide it from everybody. She didn't let my grandpa do it so why should we let her do it? Not fair and it won't happen. 
__label__label1 Well, today is my second day as a freshmen at ORGNAME. My fist class was at 0:00 in the morning and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought I wouldn't be able to understand the professor at all, but surprisingly I understood him very well and I understood what he was talking about. It was a review over stuff we were suppose to have learned already, and it was all so familiar to me. I guess I really did learn something last year in Calculus. I did have a really good teacher and I did well on the Calc AP exam. I have to remember to write a thank you note to my high school professor. He was the coolest. He was so passionate about what he was teaching and he really got me into what he was discussing. I understood it very well and actually enjoyed it too. I wish I had teachers like him in other subjects I took in HS. M economics teacher was not to good. It was an AP course too and I really felt that I didn't learn much. Now I'm going to take an economics class in college. I hope I get the same relaxed feeling as in my business Calculus class. The professor seems pretty cool. And maybe others in the class had not so good teachers too, so they are at the same disadvantage as me. Either way I'm going to study hard and stay on top of things in my class, so I can eventually do well. If there's one thing I learned in High ORGNAME, it's to stick with it. Starting out in high school, all I wanted was the easy way out, because the experience was so overwhelming to me and it was too scary. But at the end I started to see the big picture that in the end it is all worth it. In the end I will get a good grade trough all the hard work I put forth and then I can have that satisfied feeling that I did good and all my work paid off, so I must continue it. So I got in the habit of working my hardest and hoping to see the good result that are so satisfying to see. I usually get to see those results I so desperately work for but if not I work even harder the next time so I can finally see the results I was looking for. My High School was extremely competitive and I managed to keep up and just make it in the top ten percent. I'm very proud of myself, and where I am today. Many hispanic females such as myself with the same background are not as fortunate as me. In fact, most of my girl friends are working or going to a community college where I just don't see as much as opportunity as that which will be revealed to me at the ORGNAME ORGNAME School. Already I've been hearing in some of my classes that students tried out for the business school but didn't get in. That makes me feel so proud and honored for the position I am in. Other students have told me how hard they are trying to get into the business school. Again, I realize how lucky I am. I can't see myself majoring in anything else besides Business, maybe psychology, but that would be it. Psychology was my second choice for a major. I was that close to being a psychology major. So, now I know it was meant to be. I've had an accounting internship already, and I 'v e been to numerous business programs, which I have enjoyed very much. It brings me so much joy to say that I just may have found my niche because I know that this major includes all things that I enjoy. 
__label__label1 I guess I'm just supposed to write what I'm thinking right now. I love listening to music. I guess it releases some kind ORGNAME hormone or something that can just totally change my mood. If I'm sad about something, which would most likely have to do with my boyfriend or my parents, I can listen to a song and it will totally relax me and make me feel so much better. It should a kind of therapy  I think that they have already made that up  musical therapy. One of my friends from high school that is going to ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME is majoring in that I think. I really miss PROPNAME. He's my best friend and my boyfriend all in one. I can't wait to talk to him today  I've already done all of my homework for today and I don't have any more classes today. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are my hard days. I had a rhetoric class that I was taking but I'm not anymore because the professor gave a really sour first impression  she didn't seem happy at all to be teaching. I think that that's sad when someone doesn't like their job. I want to be happy when I'm older  I want to be a child psychiatrist. But as of right now, the psych department isn't accepting any more psych majors so I'm going to have to wait on that one. I want to continue to medical school, but I don't know where I want to apply for that. I have a couple of years to think about it though more than a couple. Oh  My favorite song is on  one of those songs that you just want to turn up really loud. Okay I have ten more minutes. Okay, my shoes are too small! Have you ever had a pair of tennis shoes that are too small? It really is painful  I hope my feet aren't still growing because they are already a size 0 and a half and a 0 would make me look like I have clown feet. If you have size 0 feet I'm sure you don't look like you have clown feet so don't take it the wrong way. I'm just talking about me. I hate the people who walk around college like they are cooler than everyone else  you know they probably thought that they were so cool in high school. Maybe the star quarterback or the head cheerleader. But who even cares about that stuff now. Not me! But that's okay. I took an ORGNAME ORGNAME course last year in high school and I loved it. It's what got me interested in Psychology in the first place. I was going to be a photojournalist. But after taking the psych class I decided that I really enjoyed that a lot more than photography. Photography is great as a hobby though, but not to make a living. I also was watching a show on TLC on a family vacation to LOCNAME (dad's idea) and it was an ER show and I really thought that was interesting. I can be easily inspired. Okay my time is up. 
__label__label0 I really don't now exactly what to write. my mind is just blank. I met this really hot guy at my dorm and I want to keep talking to him. he doesn't remind me of PROPNAME PROPNAME at all but what can I say. my vision is blurred today probably because of the ozone warnings. I can't believe that it was 000 degrees the other day. I wish that I would have made the dance team, but I guess I knew that I wouldn't. I really want to change my major. I hate ballet with a passion and today I felt sick to my stomach in class because I hate it so much. brandon makes me so mad because he acts gay all the time. what is up with him and jennifer, why don't they just date or something. I wonder if jen really likes jansen or what. I really want a boyfriend. I dreamed about kevin last night and it was so weird because he was actually being nice. I was sick and in the hospital or something and he was taking care of me. I want to meet justin timberlake so bad. I just want to have sex with him. I miss my brother and I can't believe that my father hasn't called me in over 0 months. And he didn't even come to my graduation. ugh. I really don't like my classes and I already have trouble getting myself to class. I am such a bad student. I wonder where sammy is today? I really want him back but that will never happen. I pretend that there is a chance but I am kidding myself now that he is with mrs. perfect. jen lovey. I don't know that pisses me off so much I want to scream. I think it was the same guy in class today that said mating choices that asked who was single the first day. I will have to go and meet him. I'm hungry and I feel extremely fat. I was thinking today about why people swing their arms when they walk. that reminds me of seinfeld and when PROPNAME makes fun of the woman who doesn't swing her arms. I think I like patobut I'm not really attracted to him. I wonder if you can actually like someone as in love if you aren't attracted to them. maybe I am and I just don't want to admit it. the mind is so weird. It psychs you out to think one thing but then you get all confused because you don't know if that is what you really think. that was complicated. I feel bad that I have not made time for God in my life and I want to but then I find fun things to do and forget. I need to pray about that. I can't wait to meet the man that I'm going to marry. I'm looking at this picture of my best friend from high school and not one thought comes to my head. sometimes I think that it was good we went our own ways because we were getting tired of each other. I feel bad for casey and I really need to call daniel. patrick is the rudest boy in the world. I don't think he has ever been nice to me. Oh well his loss. I am so broke right now. I need to get a loan but the stupid texas thing is gay and won't work. I wonder if my finger is broken or not. I can't decide if I want to try out for the ut dance team or not. what is up with all my homework. I never have a life anymore. I think I'm really going to hate school. maybe I will drop out and go back home and work at heb. my life is going nowhere. its not like I'm actually going to dance on broadway so what's the point of even trying for it. I hate writing journals for dumb modern class. That's a bunch of crap. this school is so messed up with all its procedures and freaking lines that are always miles long. my feet are killing me. I need to go to the chiropractor. where is melissa. what is she doing? I'm thinking that this is the easiest writing assignment I've ever done. my English teacher mrs. dillard ran away with another teacher and got married and I never saw her again. that was strange. and my dad did that too. he told me in a mexican food restaurant and I wanted to kill him. oh and the orange drink that we used to drink and the wasp that was trapped in the house and I started crying. my dog died when I was little. I miss my cat at home but I don't want to go home and see my mom. she will drive me crazy. brittney spears is such a hoe. if she slept with justin that is gross. I want to meet him and ask him. I think I will. LOCNAME is going to be tight. the drive sucks but to meet him I would do anything. man I just want to know what it would be like to kiss him. ohhhh, dang I can't wait. I want to talk to zal. I wonder if he is back from paris yet? I think I'm don't know so yeah. 
__label__label0 Okay I guess I should begin this by mentioning a little bit about me I guess that's one thing we can I mean I can talk about. I was wondering when I was going to put a period in. That's one thing I'm bad at, I forget to put periods. I hate computers especially when they act up I mean I don't hate them it's just there so sensitive almost like people. People are sensitive to things like for instance today this guy I was talking to. I brought up why I had only seen him say hi to hispanics. Because I feel that you should be as friendly with every sort of people. However I know he's not a racist but I just wanted to bring that issue up to him to hear his response. This question was what my other friend said had made him mad. But hey I'm just frank like that I can't help it. I think now that I'm getting into the mode of things I'm starting to realize how my old self is coming out of me but I told myself that I was going to be me. Not to stop or halt to my small voices in my head. Actually its just one I don't want to give you all the idea that I'm schizo or anything. However I wanted what drugs can do to one. Is there any positive effects from psychedelic drugs? But I'm too afraid to find out that answer. That is something that I've noticed here in campus. It seems to be the main issue at hand but I also think that I just may surround or interact with people with a drug background. Like the book said you group yourself with people like yourself. That's so great about college, no matter who you are you'll find someone like you or for you. Right now I'm working on the female part of that companionship. I read somewhere that right now at this age one is in an endless tireless search for love even to the extreme of promiscuity. But I guess its pretty lame talking about my love life on this assignment but "hey" no one said I was confined to a set of topic. In fact, as I understood it. it's pretty much what we want to write about it. Is that not true, I think so. Notice how I'm burning time writing about nonsense. Or B. S. as some might call it. I'm really glad that I didn't procrastinate this to the last second. The scary thing is that I'm doing this assignment at about twelve thirty or so. In that vicinity. I guess. I guess my time is up. 
__label__label1 I came back to my home town for Labor Day. I didn't really want to, but my friend talked me into coming with her. I've only been gone a week and I'm already back. Why? I'm not home sick. I guess I just didn't want to stay in LOCNAME when everyone I knew was leaving. I hope PROPNAME made it to the airport. I'm really worried about him right now. I pray for his mom to get better but I just don't know. I want to promise him everything is going to be alright but I just can't. I wish he would stop drinking to make the pain go away but I guess if it makes him feel better right now. Who am I to tell him what to do anyway? I wonder what time PROPNAME's game is tomorrow. My mom told me but I forgot. Maybe I should have gone to LOCNAME this weekend. I don't know? I think anything's better that being in LOCNAME. Football is such a big thing here. Of course the first thing we do is go to PROPNAME's football game as soon as we got here. I'm glad PROPNAME doesn't do anything as dangerous as that I already worry about him enough. I really think we are maturing in our relationship, learning to work through problems that most couples don't ever have in their entire lives. I don't know what he's going to do if he loses her too. I know she wants to be with his dad but isn't it selfish to leave your children. Catherine just came in here to ask me what time I was going to get up. I said 00 but that wasn't early enough so we decided on 0:00. I am very happy with my schedule because I don't have a class before 0:00 and I like all of them. One thing about school I hate is that I'm always so tired. Why can't I check my stupid email from my house? You would think a major computer system at a major university would have some way you could check it without having to download this and that. You should be able to enter your IF or UTEID and open a link site, but no. Nothing is that easy. I hate computers and if I never had to use one I wouldn't mind a bit, but if I didn't know how I couldn't pass any of my classes. That is another thing. Why is everything I need for a class on the internet? I feel sorry for people who have no clue how to use it. I thought PROPNAME was never going to hook up her computer but she finally discovered she had no choice. Computers are our lives these days. What would the human race do without them? It's scary you know, our whole life is on this thing and if they know what their doing, anyone could find some thing you don't want them to have. 
__label__label0 I am tired now. I don't know what I should talk about. I like this assignment. Wonder when it's due? PROPNAME PROPNAME is the most beautiful person I know. I love you. I mean I love her with all of my heart, mind, body, and soul. I like psychology in high school. It was very interesting and personal. That draws people in or so I think. Psychology is the food of the sea. My roommate's a weirdo. He wears a hat to watch PROPNAME PROPNAME. My other roommate got his computer from ORGNAME today. I like PROPNAME. I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is. Someone's going to be sorry, like all you witches and all you slime and all you whitewigged pinheads who make screwing a big crime. You twistedup my life and spit on all my dreams and made me hate myself. Now come on shoot me set me free. I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts standing in a row. I don't like boy bands. I love food. I love my computer. I love the Internet. I have had a computer for four years+. I view myself as an expert in computer engineering. I don't think I can think anymore. My brain's broken. I'm bleeding internally. I'm a nervous wreck. I deserve respect. I'm walking a tight rope without a circus net. I was invited to my first frat party tonight, which I didn't attend. I don't think my girlfriend/fiancee would have liked me to go to that so I didn't go. Cased closed. Time's up! 
__label__label1 wow! I'm not much on typing for 00 minutes, but I love to write emails to my friends. so I guess that that counts. I miss them so much, they are my friends from camp. I get to see them this weekend, and I cannot wait. my roommate likes to listen to music while she studies and that is the only conflict that we ever have, I guess that I just need to say something to her, cause I'm sure that she doesn't care. well, actually, I know that she doesn't. I hope that I can fit everything into my schedule that I need to, cause I have a lot on my "to do list". haha, I'll try! that's all I can do. this whole new responsibility thing is something that I thought would be less than it is. I mean, I thought that I was pretty responsible, but I'm guessing that now I'm not. you learn new things about yourself everyday. but, I'm glad that my parents raised me that way that they did. I miss them. but that's ok, cause I have so many new friends down here that I don't know what to think. I've had some dates, but nothing GREAT and way exciting so far. I guess that I'm picky but that's a good thing. maybe God will just bless me w/ some amazing guy while I'm hear at school well, it doesn't have to be this year cause I have too much going on right now. haha, ok. my phone rings way to much. and people are always stopping by, like about 0 people just walked in my door. I need to catch up on my quiet times. yep, I do. I wish that I could control how much I eat, well, I guess that if I keep on telling myself that, then I need to take some action. well, self, listen. I hope that my interest grows stronger in my nursing major cause its kind of vivid right now. anyway, all this nutrition talk makes me think about eating right and working out and stuff. I need to shave me legs. ok, all this homework is quite an overload. I really like my room, I think that it reflects my personality. I change my thoughts a lot. I expected that when I would write this, that I might just write about one thing, but I keep thinking about a lot of things. I guess that I didn't think about it too much, cause I get distracted very easily. they are in there talking about brittney spears. most people don't like her but I like her. haha, weird for a girl, but I love to dance and sing. I think that she's talented. I hope that I don't have to go back and capitalize all the beginnings of my sentences cause I haven't done it this whole time. now my roommates are joking about their dates. I love to talk to people, they make me happy. well, yea, I really like to talk to people and get to know them. its so much fun. I feel that I'm rambling about absolutely nothing. I wish that I could see the stars here in LOCNAME. but I love when I get to get away cause that's one of my favorite things to do. maybe I'll get a chance to this weekend when I go to a&m. I love how people tell me that they are praying for me. cause I know that pray works. GOD IS THE DEAL! yea pray makes me happy too. being happy can keep anyone going in life. different things make different people happy. I like to find that out about people. God fills me w/ my joy! I really like typing this cause it makes me think about what I am really about. I feel guilty when I make some smart remarks and then I cussed today. which, I never do. that just makes me feel like a piece of junk. ok, I have to go, byebye. :) 
__label__label1 As I begin to write this essay, I am thinking of what my mind is doing in preparation for writing. I began going through ideas that have come to me earlier this day, trying to find one that I might be able to write about for 00 minutes. I can hear the TV on in the background. It's Monday Night Football, so my mind continues to convince my eyes to look over to my left and look at the teams that are playing. However, I know that I need to write this essay, so I have made a pact with myself not to look over until I'm done. I am occasionally checking my watch to see how long I have been writing. I started at 0:00pm, so I will be done at 0:00. PROPNAME PROPNAME's voice is somewhat distracting since he doesn't sound like the normal, professional voice of a sports announcer, and I laugh at his jokes only because they are not that funny. Now I'm trying to think of something else, only because I know this essay was meant to show what my mind thinks of on it's own, and not my personal opinion of the football game on TV. I temporarily blanked out, and there was nothing I could think of to write, so I stopped and stretched my hands and neck. Even though I am concentrating on the computer screen in front of me, my ears have nothing better to do than listen to the ads. I don't think it's a good thing that I am able to tell there was a car ad on just because of the music playing in the background. However, I suppose that is why advertisers pick certain kinds of music. They're hoping that it will stick in the minds of the viewers and they'll buy that certain product. I do not know the specific car that was just advertised based on the music, but I am sure that it was some sort of truck that was being advertised as a tough, strong vehicle. The idea of advertising reminds me that I want to go into the college of communications. I know I am a creative and artistic person, so I want a career that will utilize my abilities and something that I can personally enjoy. I would love to be involved with an advertising team coming up with ideas for companies, or a sports photographer. In high school, I was the Photography Editor for the school newspaper. I took many photos for the sports section, and I truly enjoyed standing on the sidelines at the football games and taking pictures. By being so close to the players, I got to understand their true size and feel the emotions going on during the game. Now that I've seen what that's like, I know that when one watches a game from the stands, they are missing out on some of the action and emotion. However, after going to the UT game this past weekend, I realized that the crowd has its own vibe that is also fun to be a part of. As that streak of thought came to an end, I glanced down at my watch and noticed the time was merely 00 seconds away from 0:00, so by now my time is done. 
__label__label0 I'm somewhat in question with the purpose of this assignment. I'm in a hurry, with places to go and things to do; once again I leave things to the last moment. My 00 minutes will be up and then I will find myself fleeing out the door to make my next objective of the day. Duty from 00, and then the notsoceremonious, colors ceremony. I wonder who codes the script for these pages. Is it Dr. PROPNAME himself who makes the web pages for his own classes; I doubt that all the professors are even somewhat proficient in HTML, needless the mention all the complicated CGI scripts that must be involved with all these online forms. So long as you have a working understanding of how CGI/Java/html works, with an updated WYSIWYG web page creator, it is not all too difficult to create and publish your own web page. My topic flows from one to another as quickly as the minutes roll by while typing this assignment. The lectures of this class are interesting, even entertaining (imagine that), though I'm worried on the difficulty of the test. We have covered a great deal of material from the book, most of which was only very vaguely covered in class. Most of the concepts so far are somewhat familiar to me. I took psych my junior year in High School with a very good teacher. He used every moment that was allocated in his classes to make sure we absorbed as much knowledge as possible. He was dedicated to his work, and would compel us to be dedicated to ours. This is of course Friday, and while I was supposed to be free after noon today, I find that my ROTC obligation will keep me occupied at least until 0000. I'm beginning to realize just how much time this is taking up from me; it will be a struggle to maintain any academic performance that I have begun in my classes. I have taken either tests or exams in all but this class. The computers are down so I don't know what my grade is yet, and I don't have enough time to check with the correction sheet on the website to calculate my grade myself. Well, my twenty minutes is almost up, just a few more to go. I haven't really written much, nor has my writing kept any cohesive thought or substance to it, but I suppose that's what's to be expected from something like this. I don't know what this is supposed to convey about me or my personality, but whatever it is, I probably wouldn't want to know anyway. And now I'm off to finish the rest of my day. 
__label__label1 Right now I am realizing how tired I am after such a long day of work. I worked all day today and I think I have sneezed at least 000 times. I wonder if I have allergies. My kitten is crawling across the keyboard. Man, do I type really slow or what. I probably won't be able to type very much in 00 minutes. I am really frustrated with by boyfriend right now. I think that must be a "woman thing. " I don't know. Maybe I am a little hard on him. I don't know. I just really wish he could be more open with me a communicate with me better. I really wish he would tell me how he truly feels about me and about us. I am so frustrated with it all. I be psychologists get a lot of complaints about men from us women. I am really sure of that. I am really realizing that men don't communicate very well about relationships. Unless you are talking about football or cars, you might as well forget. it. I really don't know how to take his comment this weekend that he likes cars better than he likes women. I really take offense to that comment. I really think that that is personally directed to me. I don't know. I know he is not sure about us and I pray all the time that he will know how he feels about things and us, but so far that prayer is sill out there. I really don't know what to do now. I am not trying to make him choose me or hit the road, but I just don't want this to drag on for five years of my life and then end. I just don't want to waste any more time in my life. I know if I would have stayed with my high school boyfriend, we would probably be married by now and maybe even be happy, but things never felt complete with him and I am so glad that I realized that back then. With PROPNAME, things feel so much more real and I really think that is why things have seemed so much harder. We have been through a lot this past year together. With my whole surgery and illness, he sure was great. A lot of men that might have to deal with a sick girlfriend going through surgery and IV treatments would run and never look back. Not him. Thankfully God gave him the patience to put up with me and stick things out with me and help me get through such a trying time. This past year really has been a trying one. I was in the hospital numerous times, had about 0 inches of my small and large intestines removed, went through a four month new IV treatment and all at the same time tried to find a medication that would help keep my body in remission. I am thankful that I am now in the remission that I have longed for and I think my doctor has found a successful dosage and mixture of medications that are helping keep me stable. God has answered so may prayers and is continuing to watch over me. Being sick has really opened my eyes to a lot and helped me grow so much as a person. I really have had to grow up dealing with such a horrible illness. Its really hard being 00 dealing with a chronic illness that you know there is no cure for and having to deal with it daily, either by pain or medications or doctors. I think I am down to taking about 00 pills a day now. I was taking about 00. PROPNAME said I would jiggle when I walked. I think I still do. My doctor is continuing to decrease my medications thankfully. Looking at the clock my time is up. Hope this doesn't bore you too much. Take care! 
__label__label0 well. how do I start? I suppose I'll just start by saying that I am very tired of school I don't even know why so soon I mean my classes aren't all that bad yet but I'm tired of waking up so early to catch the crowded bus and always having to walk everywhere in the heat one thing I am excited about is my boyfriend coming down in less than 0 days to visit me. he's from texas tech and I miss him so much the only bad thing is that I think that I'm hiding myself from the world because I feel safe enough with him that I block out the rest of the world and therefore I am not quite as social as I should be. but I'm really worried that I'm going to lose him and then where will I be? who will I have? oh well can't think of that right now. I'll enjoy my life with him for now long distance relationships are very hard. I don't quite know what will happen but I do know that he is very special to me and every guy I go out with in the future will be compared to him enough about the mushy stuff I'm living with my sister up here its really convenient she takes care of me and we don't really fight a lot she's sick right now I don't know what to do except for buy her medicine I'm a bad nurse oh wells I can't believe we have been in school for bout 0 weeks now. it feels like 0 months everything is moving by so slow I miss LOCNAME I can't wait to go back and visit my family and friends ill be going back in bout 0 weeks or so I hate it that I'm easily distracted when I start on my homework the tv usually gets to me because we have cable and so some really good movie will be on and ill sit there and watch it instead of working on my homework. that's really starting to become a habit and the thing is when the show is finally over and I start on my homework its already 00 and I'm pooped I need better study habits I'm currently a biology major. I don't even think that's what I'm going to follow through here I don't go out partying like most college students I think I should take advantage of my college years here but I really don't like the whole clubbing experience I'm full and I feel like vomiting. I think I ate too many chicken wings. oh wells I hate the computer I'm on the internet connection is really slow and I hate tying on a laptop computer. I'm use to the normal ones I still have a lot of reading to do I have to finish reading in this class and in biology. I hope I don't bomb any of my classes my parents expect me not to since my sister is here and will show me the ropes. do you know how much pressure that is? I feel as if I never seem to make my parents proud enough it comes with the territory. being the middle child is really hard anyways. I miss chili our chinchilla ill get to keep him for about 0 weeks so I'm really excited our apartment is so messy we live like boys I'm getting really tired already. I think ill be up late yet again tonight ill shower tomorrow morning I've dyed my hair 0 times and yet it wont give me the color I want I'm so frustrated I'm frustrated with life with school with love everything when I took the pretesting thing I felt so depressed. everything I was answering about myself was so negative. in some way and so I felt really bad once I was done. that reminds me I have to go check out that bulletin board to check out some experiments I could to do obtain my 0 hours actually now 0 0/0 which is great. I hope they don't make me do anything really weird I'm kind of hesitant to do that stuff oh wells I haven't been out a lot since I've been here in LOCNAME I'm kind of homesick. I miss the simple life I lead when I was in LOCNAME everything has changed things are not so simple anymore I fell as though I'm not as happy here I don't know why though. don't worry. I'm not suicidal or anything I just wish I knew what was bugging me I think. actually I hope things will be fine soon this year is moving by so slow. and its so hard making friends I have at least one friend in each class except for chemistry that really bad because you should really have a study partner in that class I think ill have to make friends in there soon I feel stress stress from the world everything I hate it I get stressed easily sleep is overcoming me. I have to stay awake. I'm already behind in my readings can't get even more behind. I need a major massage my shoulders are so tense. my whole body is tense I like these kinds of writing assignments because it helps release some of my emotions hidden inside some stress has lifted but there's still a lot there well. my time has ended. its been 00 minutes 00 minutes that have flown by ill end it on this note. I need some sleep. I'm going to sleep goodbye. 
__label__label0 Sitting to write this assignment, I feel I have lots of other things to think about. When will I find time to get everything done? I still need to unpack boxes, get things organized. The days pass, and more is left unfinished. I thought I was off to a good start, but I need to find a way to organize myself so that I can meet daily goals, weekly goals, and monthly goals. My problem with procrastination is always adding unnecessary stress to my life, and if I could only stay on top of things, or work a little more each day, I would feel less stressed, with a better sense of accomplishment. What do I want to get done? I want to finish unpacking, decorate my room  that requires that tickytacky stuff, since nothing sticks on these stupid walls. Need to find more little pillows, and little desk and drawer organizers. Little stuff like that. I need to organize my pictures, decide which I want to hang up, which are best in frames, where I will display all my frames. I also have to decide which stuff I really don't need, and pack that up, and ship it home to LOCNAME. I need to organize my school stuff, still buy my aerobic book, and the right edition of the Odyssey for that freshman seminar, plus get some three ring binders. I know I brought some, but have no idea where they are at the moment. It seems impossible to loose something in such a small space, but I've managed to do it quite a few times. I need to balance my checkbook, pay my cell phone bill, and call my bank about my debit card that is not working. Did I not activate it right? I know I have enough money in the bank. I don't understand what the problem is. I have to remember to get cash; I have borrowed money too much from people in the past couple of day, not because I was out of money, but because I kept forgetting to figure out the problem. Until I do, I can't get money out of the ATM machine, I'd have to go down to the bank, and get money out, or write a check for cash, or something. Still trying to figure out all this bank stuff. I wonder if that cell phone bill is right. There seem to be some unnecessary charges on it, or ones I didn't know about. Why is my mom not calling me back? I know they are busy with soccer stuff, but I left a message saying I needed to talk, and asked those questions on the answering machine, you would think she would call back immediately. Especially since she expressed so much concern recently when she didn't hear from me in only a couple days. I need to get on top of my reading, and studying. Want to find a better place to study than my room. Too many distractions, my computer, my music, my phone, my ongoing room decorating project, unpacking, the TV, email, the neighbors, the stupid smoke detector, that is low on batteries, and is constantly, constantly beeping, relentlessly. And the person on the floor above us who never stops banging on the floor, it is so annoying, between the beeping, and banging, they are enough to drive my absolutely insane. I went to the point of stuffing cotton in my ears last night to try and block out the high pitched beeping, it is so shrill, it's painful, especially terrible when you're trying to sleep. My roommate doesn't seem to mind, she can block out almost anything. I don't know how she devotes so much time to studying. I wish I could be more disciplined like that. I would be much happier with myself. But, I am having so much fun. Will study later tonight at LOCNAME and Noble's with PROPNAME. We'll see how that place is for studying. It's hard not having my car, although most people have theirs. It's nice not to be the responsible driver, and to have to pay for gas parking, or worry about getting lost, the ridiculous one way streets, and no road signs hardly to help you out, but still at times it would be much easier if I had it here. Next year, I will but what car will I have? What are my parents going to decide about that? What about molly? What will she drive? Will I get my prelude? Will that be too hard on my parents? How are they handling sorority costs? Should I get a job soon, to help with all that? How are my bills going to be this month? I'm sure the long distance bill on my regular phone line will be out of control. Try to use my cell phone more, free long distance, but not sure exactly how long I have the extra minutes for. Will john go by my parents' house tonight and set up his ticket? It makes me really nervous, not quite sure why. I know he want to come, and I know he's planning on it, but I want to see him so bad, and miss him so much, I don't want to get my hopes up too high, in case things don't work out. How will things be when he comes, how will be people like him?. Will they be accepting of him? What about the whole tattoo thing and the way he dresses? I want him to bring all his long sleeved shirts and nice clothes, but I do not not want him to change for anyone, nor do I want him to change. I love him exactly the way he is, and wish there were more people like that here, but I don't want him to be uncomfortable, or other people to judge him or make him feel uncomfortable. I want everyone to like him and for him to have a good experience. Even though I know he's not coming to go to a bunch of parties, or meet a bunch of people, he'll be here to spend time with me, but I still want to take him out, take him to the game, show him how big and fun, and cool the parties are here. Definitely won't be going to any SigEp functions, I know how they are about outsider guys, especially someone like john. I could never be embarrassed of him, but it might be uncomfortable, especially if any guys give him a hard time, and then I'll feel like I brought someone who wasn't supposed to be there, like with PROPNAME the other day. That was a really bad experience. I don't want anyone to make john feel that way. Having a car would be nice for when he comes, could pick him up from the airport, take him to cool places, the oasis, the lake, mt. whatever where the ORGNAME girls ate tonight. There are so many pretty, cool things, three days is not nearly enough. But, the time will be spent well, and will either make it easier than waiting until thanksgiving to see him, or make it harder, because he'll be fresh in my mind. They say out of sight, out of mind, and I believe that to be very true. Same went for mike. But, the longer I'm away, the less I think about john, and the less I truly miss him. I think the same goes for him. It doesn't seem as urgent for him to see me the way that it was when I first was here. But of course that should be expected and it was. I don't like the way some things are here. I want to get out and meet some different kinds of people, or meet nonfrat type boys, because I'm not liking the conservative style that much. It's not what I 'm used to. I definitely don't like how money and status are such an issue. It's ridiculous, it reminds me of the movies. I didn't think people like that really existed. I left LOCNAME thinking I was getting away from all the selfabsorbed, selfimage, stuff, that I was really growing sick of, only to come somewhere and feel as though I'm surrounded by an even worse kind of snobbery, based on money, family name, status, having not really anything to do with how good looking you are, as is the LOCNAME snob, but how much money your dad makes, or what kind of car you drive, or whether or not you buy an $000 shirt to wear to a frat party. It's all very ridiculous to me, and it makes me sad, and homesick for a place where it's really cool to be laid back and extremely casual all the time, and where you're not judged by how much money you have. I do love how the boys always hold open doors for you, and pay for everything; those are aspects I do very much enjoy. I would not want to raise my kids here, I'm not even sure now if I want to live here after college. I love a lot of things about it, and I 'm having so much fun, meeting lots of wonderful girls, the guys are a problem for me. I went to college thinking that it's funny knowing this is probably the place where I'll meet my husband. I highly doubt it at this point in time. I'd have to find a diamond in the ruff, like PROPNAME did. It makes me miss john, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, LOCNAME, PROPNAME, even so much more. It makes me miss all my guy friends, and the fun and comfort of guys who are not polite, but funny and perverted, to a certain point of course. I can't wait to see john, I wonder how things will be. I've decided to tell him how I really feel, knowing his reaction will probably not be to admit he feels the same way. I think he probably has an idea of the way I feel, I've probably hinted at it before. I do have a glimmer of hope, since he's been signing his letters with the word love, and wrote, "love, john on the picture he drew, and he is spending at least $000 to come out and see me, which unlike all the stupid rich boys here is money that he has worked his butt off to make, doing countless hours of work, and now is throwing it all into a three day trip. It really is incredible to me. It touches me to think he would do something like that for me. I wonder what PROPNAME and PROPNAME think about that, especially PROPNAME. What about PROPNAME, I wonder if mike will find out. What will he think about that? He once said, regarding the necklace and earrings from PROPNAME, that he would never spend that much money on a girl ever. Well, he knows john never ever has any money, never has a steady job, and mooches off of everyone else. How would he feel if he heard that john was spending every penny he had to come and see me? Maybe then he would open his eyes a little. Probably not though. I hope someone will be willing to pick john up from the airport, I know PROPNAME won't want to miss any of her classes, for him of course I could, it doesn't look like I have any test or quizzes that Thursday or Friday. I do have a psychology test the day after he leaves. How will it be when he leaves? I wonder if I'll be really depressed. Probably, I'm probably making it harder on myself. Probably harder on both of us. 
__label__label0 Be able to describe the kinetic theory of matter and explain what kinetic energy is. Distinguish between movement and net movement. Be able to describe the factors that affect the direction and speed of molecular movement and net movement. Define and distinguish between: selectively permeable, plasma membrane, dialysis tubing. Explain how the following transport mechanisms work. For each mechanism, also discuss the factors that affect the rate and direction of transport: simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis, dialysis, and solute pumping. Explain how chemical indicators can be used to test for the presence of starch, reducing sugars, and sodium chloride. Distinguish between isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic solutions. Also explain what happens to cells, with and without cell walls, when they are placed in each type of solution. Distinguish between independent and dependent variables and be able to identify both types of variables in an experiment. Procedures: First, obtain the following materials: 0 room temperature agar plates, labeled A and B,0 refrigerated agar plate, labeled C, Potassium permanganate solution, Methylene blue solution, marking pen, ruler, and pasteur pipettes. Turn the agar plate labeled "A" upside down and make two small dots on the bottom of the plate with the marker. Each dot should be at least 0cm from the edge of the plate and at least 0cm away from the other dot. Next to one dot write "potassium permanganate" and next to the other dot write "Methylene blue". Mark plates "B" and "C" the same way. Remove the lid from agar plate "A". Using a micropipette, withdraw 00 microliters of potassium permanganate solution and use it to make a small, neat droplet of dye solution directly above the correspondingly labeled dot. Place a similar dot of potassium permanganate solution on plates "B" and "C". Use the same procedure to place small, neat drops of Methylene blue dye solution on your plates. Keep plates A and B at room temperature, and place plate C back in the refrigerator. Every 00 minutes, determine the diameter of the dye circles. Record your measurements in a table. Now, label five 000mL beakers 00. Fill the beakers with about 000mL of the solutions listed in the table below: 
__label__label0 Why do they make us do this? Do they want to figure out what thought leads to the next? Like the autistic people where their thoughts lead them to the next, but only one leads to the next, perhaps a smell or feeling or emotion. I wonder what those people feel. I wonder if they are deprived of some of the things we are. I remember hearing that they can do brilliant things, compose symphonies and paint incredible things, but need help to button their shirt. Wasn't that movie starring PROPNAME PROPNAME who tried to no that wasn't it. I don't remember who starred in it. Maybe it was someone who looked like PROPNAME PROPNAME  didn't we watch that movie in eighth grade? The one about the people who didn't react to normal stimulants? The ones who tossed the ball around from one person to the next, but didn't engage in conversations? Engage that's a good word. My roommates and I were talking about funny words the other day. PROPNAME thought that "fib" was a good word, and there was something else I said by the elevator. It might have been. enthralled, That was it! I remember now. I love great words. If I could have an extensive vocabulary, I think perhaps I would be taken more seriously. There was a cabdriver tonight that knew a lot of big words. I asked him to write one of my papers. What was he doing driving a cab? Can't he find some other occupation that suits him better. Maybe he likes to meet people. Perhaps he finds it interesting to encounter different personalities. Why can't he get a better job? There have to be much better things to do. But what about that movie American Beauty where PROPNAME PROPNAME quit his job and started to flip burgers that was a good movie. Maybe that's what made him happy. To do jobs that don't require a truck load of thought. But then again he found out that his wife was cheating on him. That really sucks. I would never do that kind of thing to my boyfriend. That's downright mean. What kind of girl would do that? There's no way in hell anyone would ever find me doing that and speaking of stupid things, what about suicide? Why do people do that, or rather why would they ever think about it. That is so selfish. If I ever found out my friends were thinking about it I'd beat them into the ground. What would make them think that there is nothing left in the world for them? Do they think no one loves them or cares for them? I just don't get it. What a stupid thing to think or consider. Some people have real problems. I had a conversation like this with my kickboxing instructor one time. It was after the cardio kickboxing class and I was talking with him. I don't know how we got on the subject, but he told me this story about one of the guys that used to go there a first degree black belt and he committed suicide. In fact, I knew the family. The mom actually helped me with this paper I was writing for my really tough English teacher. Little did I know that not only was my English teacher tough, he was brilliant. I have such a great respect for that man. Some day, when I make it big  and the word is "when" because it will happen  I'm going to send him a shit load of money for retirement. I have so many plans for when I get older. I'm going to start a scholarship in my name and all this other grand stuff that I can't think of right now. Oh look at that, the time is up. catch you later. 
__label__label1 At this present, I am feeling a lot of stress. I don't know why. There is so much going through my head right now, that I sometimes get confused. Maybe I'm just worrying about my grades and how my four years will come along at ORGNAME. I am concentrating at this screen, but feel kind of dazed and a little lonely. Come on now, hurry up and get through this. I am very strict on myself when it comes to following through with things. A few days ago, I took a quiz in my Bio 000 class. I don't think I did very well on it, and it's still nagging on me like an itch on my back that I can't reach. I have very high expectations of myself. I guess that's because of the way I was brought up, and the way I handled myself through my other years of schooling. In my high school, I was second in my class. I was that type of person who always had to get straight A's. Making a B was absolutely unacceptable in my mind. This had nothing to do with my mom. She really doesn't care what I get. I and only I brought on this extreme pressure that I put on myself. I guess if you're in a habit of always making good grades, it's a habit that's very hard to break. That is how I come to terms with my behavior and attitude towards work. I hate feeling awkward. I am very selfconscious. I don't know if it has to do with me being very shy, or what, but I get nervous easily. Sometimes I feel everyone is looking at me waiting for me to make a mistake. This happens to me wherever I go. Well, I'm getting a little tired and my head is starting to hurt. Maybe it's because I've been staring at this screen already for about ten minutes straight. I don't know. About my opinions about UT: I think it's a good school. The only complaint I have is the heat. It is very hot here. I don't remember it being this hot in LOCNAME. I always wonder when the next cool day will come. When I first came here, I felt pretty homesick. Everything was new to me, and when I thought of the new responsibilities that I would have to grasp during the next four years, that really made me sweat. Not literally, but you get the idea. Now, I'm feeling pretty good. I am a very detailed oriented person. I write everything on lists, which includes my shortterm goals, my longterm goals. Everything. And every time I think of something else that I have to do in the near or distant future, I put in on a sheet of paper. I am really nervous about my future. I hope I will live beyond the expectations I have placed upon myself. I am really getting stressed out just thinking about it right now. My head feels like it's filled with cement at this moment. I got to relax and not take the mistakes I make too seriously. I am always serious. I am not a flamboyant person. Well, my twenty minutes are up now. Time to study. 
__label__label1 I'm going to be late, why did I schedule my classes so late in the day? I heard it was better to have later classes, but isn't 0pm for my first class a bit too late? It's too much trouble to change it, and oh my gosh! How am I supposed to concentrate in a room of about 000 people with my Microeconomics professor being so plain and boring. It reminds me of my U. S. History class junior year. it was crazy, I could barely stay awake. 0pm is generally when I take my afternoon nap as well, you know? Now it's twice as hard to stay awake in that class at that time. And today I've got a 00:00pm class, which I guess is a better time, don't you think? Yesterday I had a lot of time to spare before class, so I woke up early, and went to go work out, which worked out ok. I'm going to go workout to day as well. I'm going to try to work out as much as possible. you know how they talk about the freshman 00? That scares me. I mean I can see how freshmen can gain that weight. For example, I ended up skipping breakfast yesterday, and had a big lunch, which is more that I generally would eat for a lunch. SO I end up eating more than usual. But for dinner I had a sandwich and some cereal, so I think that was better. At home I just constantly snacked, which I heard is actually better than eating full meals. But at home, I actually had food lying around the house that I could just pick up at any time. IN my dorm, on the other hand, we've got ants, so I can't just have food out everywhere. And while others have a whole pantry full of food in their dorm, I've got a box of crackers, cereal, some soup, and fruit snacks. I haven't had milk in awhile, maybe I'll have milk for breakfast today. should I? Because if I do that then I won't really have a lunch, but breakfast for lunch you know? Uhh. I don't know, Everything is pretty new. This whole college lifestyle. Oh my gosh the first couple of days I was here I was really depressed. I didn't see very many of my friends, and the friends that I was seeing weren't my closest of friends. But we went over to one of my friend's dorms the other day, and just hung out and talked about old time. now that was fun. It's hard getting all together though, because everyone's got their own schedule and things to do. It'd be nice to get together again. One day at lunch I got together with a whole group of my friends, it was a lot of fun. better than just having a boring lunch with some friends that barely even talk. And my dorm room. I mean I like it, but when you compare to other peoples dorm rooms. oh my gosh! Some people really went all out. I on the other hand, just put up a few decorations and some stickers. Well some will bust out with poster and a billion frames surrounding their bed. I mean that's cool and all, but I guess I wasn't prepared to do all that. That's another thing. A lot of people already have siblings who are going here, or have previously gone here. That's why they know so much about the organizations and the things around LOCNAME. They also have access to a car, another thing I don't have, which can get kind of hard. What if I want to go back to LOCNAME? I don't really feel comfortable asking just anybody for a ride, and the bus? I don't know. I haven't actually sat on a bus to go from city to city. And I don't want to make my family drive three hours to LOCNAME, just to pick me up, and three hours back to LOCNAME, then all over again to drop me back off to school. I don't know. they say there's so much to do on campus and to get involved, but in what?? There are so many different organizations, and the one I want, I can't find. I heard that there was an Armenian cultural association in LOCNAME, and that'd be really cool if I actually found the members and joined. I tried to look them up online, but apparently the web site doesn't work. I'm not really open and just start talking to people, so making a whole new group of friends is not challenging, but not so easy either. My suitemate is real comfortable just talking to anybody. I on the other hand, don't find it so easy. I'm hungry. should I get some lunch? I haven't really had a real breakfast. Did I already say that? Hmm. so should I just get some cereal, because I'm not all that hungry, or should I get a lunch? I don't know, I'll just see what they have for lunch, and then I'll decide from my options. how does that sound? Uhh. and our elevator doesn't work. oh ya! There's another elevator. I walked three flights of stairs for nothing then? OH well. good exercise right? I didn't realize we had two elevators because I always just take the one I'm used to, but it's "temporarily out of order. " Does that mean the other one will be out of order too? Hmm. I'll go see. ok. I guess that's about it. Maybe I should start another diary. I finished the first one I had. I've had it since I was about 00. It's kind of funny looking back at all the things I wrote about. 
__label__label0 Right now I'm feeling relieved that I was able to get here  the last couple of times I tried to get to this site the computer told me the site was unavailable. Very frustrating! I like this assignment, although I'm not sure why 00 minutes are necessary; it seems to me that 00 or even 0 minutes would do. I'm really not sure what to write next  I haven't done this kind of thing since seventh grade, when I was home schooled. It's weird how your mind goes blank sometimes. I still don't know what to write. My thoughts are mostly involved with ORGNAME, with classes and so forth. I like them, in general, but only one has been intellectually stimulating so far (no, I am not going to tell you which one!) I have great hopes for the rest, though  sometimes it takes a while for a class to get into gear. Don't know what to write. Don't know what to write. Feeling frustrated, I guess. I was afraid I wouldn't think of anything to write. It's not that I have a sluggish or inactive mind  quite the opposite, actually. It's just that sometimes I don't do well when I have to write it down. Which is strange, because I love to write. I keep a journal (which you, Prof. PROPNAME, would probably find interesting) and enjoy writing in it my gripes, hopes, fears, joys and other important stuff. Maybe I'm just not good at this kind of structured work. I'm lefthanded, Prof. P  does that have anything to do with it? I have a vivid imagination, and am inclined to daydream. Hey I just remembered, you said these were confidential. I can write anything I want! I don't feel any freer with that in mind, however. I'm stuck again. Still stuck. I wonder how many of my fellow classmates have the same trouble I do with this. Stuck. Now I'm thinking of the guy I like. (I'm not going to give his name, because I'm serious about him, and I'm not sure just exactly how confidential this really is. ) I wonder if you actually read any of these, just to see what kind of people are in your class. I know that if you really picked my brain you'd have some interesting stuff (interesting in a good way, of course!) This is a tumultuous and crazy time in my life, although most people would think it tame. My beliefs are undergoing an overhaul, and everything seems to be up in the air. That's not a good feeling, but it's never dull! I think in the last few months I've learned a lot about prejudice and tolerance, and I'm glad I'm learning what I am, even if it destroys my plans for perfect happiness (sarcasm there). What kind of a world is it where people who search for truth risk having everything they want taken away? This can't be right. But it's true, and there's no denying it. This makes me feel apprehensive and sad. I feel some anger at the world, and at God too. (Yes, Prof. PROPNAME, I believe there is a God!) But real religion requires immense amounts of faith, and I have to trust that everything will end up ok. Now I feel slightly reassured. If only everything weren't so uncertain! But do I really want a world where you know exactly what's going to happen next? What if you knew when bad things were going to happen, but were powerless to prevent any of them, because everything was predestined? It's possible that everything IS predestined, but that we don't know about it. Maybe you don't admit that as a possibility, Prof. P, but I do. Anyhow, I would much rather not know what's going to happen next in most cases. But in some, like who I'm going to marry, I can barely contain my curiosity. I guess that's due to a lack of satisfying relationships in my life, that I so strongly feel the need for another one. But whatever happens, I refuse to worry  if everything's predestined, I can't change it anyway, and if it is, then I can still change things for the better. 
__label__label1 As I walk down the middle ORGNAME campus with thousands of people rushing by me on their way to class, I feel like a star in the huge night sky. With so many stars scattered throughout the sky, I seem to go unnoticed and lost. This is a feeling that I have seldom felt. As an allstar volleyball player, the student council vice president, and the homecoming queen I have always been one of the brightest stars. Just a month ago, I seemed to have my entire world in order and what seemed to me perfection. I now feel lonely and intimidated as I embark on this new phase in my life. I feel like I no longer have control, and perfection seems harder to achieve than ever. Knowing that if I do not obtain a B in Chemistry 000, my dreams of becoming a nurse are next to impossible. Can my life long dreams honestly be shattered by one college course? As I search for answers, I question whether or not I made the right decision to choose to attend the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, or if I'm even college material at all. What am I saying? Going to college was never an option for me. I want a good life for my family and I, and I've always dreamed of becoming a nurse and helping those who need me. My parents have always taught me to do my best and work towards my dreams, but words are often easier said than done. However, I could not have made it through my first week at the university if not for the love and support I have received from my family. Throughout my life, I would probably have to credit at least fifty percent of my accomplishments to my family, because they are my strong hold. Though I regard them so highly, I also feel that in this instance they are somewhat of my downfall. The transition to college would not be such a struggle for me if my ties to my family and friends that I have left behind were not so great. It is incredibly hard for me to accept change, because I accept my surroundings and others and become comfortable with them and do not want to leave my comfort zone. I feel that this is somewhat peculiar because I realize that even if I was to remain the same, with the same friends and circumstances, the world and people around me would continue to change and grow and expand. Eventually I would be left behind. As I work to achieve and to be the best I can be, I hope that along the way I will find the happy, positive person that I once was and know I still am. 
__label__label0 Must I write for 00 minutes? Why? What exactly does writing as I think, called my "stream of consciousness" prove? I suppose magical thoughts that exploit my deepest darkest secrets will arise or something. Of course they could if I really got bored because my mind does jump sporadically from idea to idea but who knows? It never stops and I can never focus on one thing for very long before I get bored. I think I have ADD or something because it is hard for me to focus for extended periods of time which I'm sure if that's a fault of mine or genetic or experience because of TV and how LOCNAMEn society has raised me. LOCNAMEn society is crap. Everyone blames violence on TV as the problem with the current "violent" America. Kids watching violent shows does not make a kid violent. Rather parents not telling their kids that violent shows are fake or parents that are violent or parents that tell kids violence is ok is what makes kids violent. It's stupid to blame entertainment, of course there are some cases where the TV is too blame. We cannot simply say it never does but we also cannot say that it's the root of the problem. The problem is parents and society today. 00 years ago parents would never let kids do the things kids do nowadays. Drugs, alcohol, sex and everything else has become much more liberal. Lets face it, all these things sell and so now we have corporate America where only the strong survive, or get rich, whichever. How the hell can you call this country so great when there jobless, starving and homeless people everyone, including children. Yeah sure for the 00% of people with jobs, even then I'm sure a good % of those people with jobs still struggle to make it. They bust their butts day in and day out to get what they can for themselves and their family yet we're experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in however many years like it matters to those people who are still unemployed or working crappy minimal wage jobs. Yeah, great country America is. I'm listening to this nice piano soloist on cd on my computer as I type for this long 00 minutes and it's quite pleasant. Whenever I listen to this I think about the girl who gave it to me, PROPNAME PROPNAME. Even though she's getting kind of fat, I still find her attractive. It's very unusual for me to find an asian attractive, well at least in the past. I find a lot more attractive here at LOCNAME nowadays because I think I just had a town full of ugly asians or something, who knows eh? Well anyway, I was so "in" to her, never could get her off my mind. I think I have a problem with obsessing over people, well girls, when I like them. I've never had a girlfriend and I've never even had the courage to ask a girl out. I'm so insecure it's not even funny. I wish I could suddenly build up courage and ask a girl out or even get a little kiss or sex or something. I'm no different than any other guy and one good thing is I rarely masturbate so luckily sex doesn't drive my mind and life. I can focus on other things such as watching tv, playing video games and talking to people. I think I want to be a psychologist, the PhD level, so I can do research or get paid lots of money to advise people. People and their pasts interest me a lot, it's freaking amazing what you learn about people when they actually open up to you. You hear about traumatizing experiences and good experiences and stories of best friends and family and deaths and everything else you can imagine. It's all fascinating to me, I love to hear about it and try to piece together how these experiences have made the person the way they are. It's pretty cool to also, for me because I keep being told I'm really easy to talk too. Be it guys or girls, I hear the same thing. So I feel as if I have some sort of gift or something that allows people to talk to me and sometimes that's all a person needs is someone to sit there and listen to another person talk and they will feel so much better. Given I don't know what to say many times but I know how to empathize and sympathize with people because I feel that I've experienced enough pain, hurts, injustices throughout my life so I'm not totally oblivious to everything. I, for the most part, understand that not everything is black and white, there is always a gray area that cannot have a simple answer. There must always be a compromise that comes from both sides or else it will be black and white and life would be boring. Life is boring as it is, why make it more so? A few thrills here and there but life usually is one big long path to death. How you live your life makes who you are and how you are in the end. Is there an end? Well there could be but that depends on what you believe in. Whether it be christianity or Buddhism or Hinduism or any of the ism's, you know where you're going or think you know where your going. So what about atheists?. Well you simply cease to exist. Isn't that a scary thought? You die and that's it, the void. You don't exist anymore. You are no longer conscious and it's like you were never alive. People remember you but you are forgotten once they die unless your a martyr or a hero or king or anything of that sort, but for the most part you are forgotten within 00 generations. And my 00 minutes is up so I'm done. 
__label__label1 Last night around 00pm or so a friend of mine from high school came knocking at my door. She told me that a guy I went to high school with had just committed suicide on Friday. Apparently he had a fight with his parents about his drug abuse (which I had no idea was even an issue with him) and he stormed out of the house. No one knew where he was so they went looking for him. They found his body by a creek in a neighborhood near mine (some of my friends still live there, too). It still hasn't hit me yet. I have been at school with him since the first grade. I know that at the funeral, it will definitely hit me. After last year I thought everything was going to be better. At the beginning of the school year (actually the summer before my senior year) PROPNAME committed suicide by hanging himself. After getting over that, PROPNAME was killed in a car accident. After coping with PROPNAME's death, I thought nothing else was going to happen. I mean, two deaths (not to mention the death of teacher) happened within the span of about three or so months. The rest of my year was going great until April. That was when I found out that one of the girls who I had been best friends with in elementary and junior high had committed suicide. She overdosed on her medication and died in her sleep. I couldn't believe it. For years I would talk to her and hang with her and played sports with her all through middle school. Going to her funeral was the hardest thing that I have EVER had to do. I cried the minute I got there and didn't stop crying until days later. Seeing her parents made it even harder. I mean what can you say to them. Nothing you could ever come up with could make them feel any better. Nothing could make you feel any better either. She had an open casket, so as we walked out after the service was over, we had to pass by her. I absolutely and completely fell apart. I couldn't see where I was going I was crying so hard. Even now as I am writing this assignment I'm getting tearyeyed. I still don't understand (and I probably never will) why anyone could take their life like that. I mean, don't they know how many people need them, how many people depend on them, or how many people just love them for who they are and how they make us feel when we're around them. PROPNAME is the second one to kill themselves from my elementary/junior high school. Everyone always talks about how things like that come in three's. Now I'm just wondering if the saying will come true. Will there be a third suicide or death that I'll have to deal with? I really and truly hope so. I sure as hell can't take another death or another funeral for that matter. When I first started this assignment I didn't think that I'd have much to say, but that doesn't look like the case. This is kind of therapeutic though. I'm tired of talking and thinking about a gloomy subject like death, so I've decided to start typing about something better. I really excited to be here at the university. I really love it here. My classes and professors are great. I am worried/anxious about final exams though, but I still have awhile before those come around. I'm still getting used to the fact that you pretty much get one grade at the end of the semester. Unlike in elementary through high school in which every 0 weeks you got a progress report and then every 0 weeks came your report card. I'm also getting used to being alone a lot. Sometimes you have to eat by yourself, or sit in class by yourself, etc. But then again you meet so many new people. Well, my time's up. 
__label__label0 It's too late to really be writing anything I think but then again I'm here aren't I? Hard to believe I am if you were to ask me where I was going to be twenty years from now it wouldn't be here. I miss my Mom and Dad though I'm not supposed to be there either. Isn't there a time when you're supposed to stop writing about your mom and dad. I'm worried that I'm not writing what I'm supposed to or that I'm not doing this naturally What is naturally anyways I mean it seems like kind of a cop out really. Naturally is a lot harder to accomplish than it looks wouldn't you say oh whoa is me I keep messing up my words and I'm not sure if this is even supposed to look pretty or what the thing with this stupid laptop is how stupid it really is It keeps on jumping up and down to the thing or in the middle of this it so it is impossible to get things down. Is natural easy for you? I wonder if that is true It's even harder to believe it is only 00 00 Whatever happened to going to bed early? I was going to attempt to do that you know Go to bed early It seems that whenever I am away from home these things occur The thing is I do this all the time. write without thinking except I do think about how things are spelled and I can't do this now Or it would take way too much time. Are you guys actually going to read this? I'm sure there are many others who are writing more fascinating things than me. I wish I could think of something funny to say then maybe I'd get an A what's funny I wonder. I wish I was in bed I'm sooo tired I haven't slept a wink I'm so tired my mind is on the brink I wonder should I get up and get myself a drink oh oh o oh I'm so tired Oh who will save your soul to me that means everything you know the songs in your head have nowhere to go except leaving the words on the page an I supposed to be speaking in poetry here? Or will I get counted off ? Are you supposed to be wondering what you get counted off for in college I wonder? My fingers are starting to hurt but the only way I can write this stream of consciousness is by lifting my hands off the keyboard because otherwise the problem arises. I've been thinking about ORGNAME lately and how much I miss it? But do I? What is here for me that ORGNAME doesn't have Why friends of course yet do I have friends? I have PROPNAME I guess though I wish more than anything I had more maybe he'd like me better Shoulders are always cramping up do they do that in others ? In tours Whose reading this anyways? Are my thoughts interesting to you I wish I had a yewl leaf or a yule log Yule that's such a cool word reminds me of Christmas I sound like a goddamn Theater major being all dramatic. What is so wrong with being dramatic I wonder What is so wrong with wanting people to see you/. anyway/. I look at all these people and I criticize them all the time I even criticize scott and I wish I didn't because then I think life would be much easier to live in I don't think anyone's as negative as I am Has it been twenty minutes yet? Oh I have ten left. I wish I could get in side the teacher's but then would I really like what I see. sounding like a theater major again and the roses are blooming outside but they'll be dead soon because they are so lovey all the flowers I have die it seems. I got to get out of this place but then where will you go You want to go to another body but you know the problems will be just as frightening there PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME what happened to you all? How come I never was on your crowd? How come you never thought I was cool enough to include in your circle? To respect? To invite? You know I think I would have stopped being so goddamn nice if you had invited me not made me feel like I had to try so hard to be your friend but I don't understand why I had to try so hard? What was wrong with me? I guess it was just sitting down with you all. I couldn't think of anything to say to you and now I can't think of anything to say to anyone? Does that mean they all think of me the same way? Am I doomed to be uncool forever/ Will I ever have that group of friends that I love to watch from afar? I keep trying and trying. I wonder what I would have possibly have done to be happier at SmU? I wanted to be their center of attention. I think I could have handled it if boys hit on me,. but they never did you know. I think I could have handled it if they had come up to me and said hey. you know were going to a movie tonight do you want to come? We really want you too,. I really want you too. And have it not be on a school night for God's sake. I mean that was half my problem I never went to anyone's house on a school night. I wanted to study. Was that so bad? And I guess I just felt very intimidated when I went over there because all I could really do was watch. I could never really join in because they didn't think it was worth listening to ? Or was it my fault because I just didn't try? Now I'm here and I don't feel any different at the coop except at this point I really don't care if they accept me or not because I have tons of more important things to do. I have my time school you know School take up like PROPNAME's work and your theater and everything. , ORGNAME is my life now,. ,. my best friend I guess. What is a best friend anyway? Everyone has their faults I guess a best friend is someone oh times up. 
__label__label0 Hello, I am so stressed right now with school. I am swamped with things to do. I don't even know where to begin I have so much. I am trying to get everything done because I am going home this weekend I don't want a lot to do. This is the first time for me to be home since I have been in college. I am really excited. I cannot wait to get away from everything. I wish I could have one day where I didn't have to do anything. I want to workout but I don't even have the time to do that. I don't see how people have jobs or be in a sorority or fraternity in school. I barely get everything done and I am not in them. They do stuff together almost every single night. I can't think of anything else right now except about what I have to do. I cannot wait until the LOCNAME and ORGNAME game, it is going to be so much fun. I also cannot wait to see my family. I think I am a little home sick. I think I keep pushing the submit button when I am writing I hope that's okay. I don't mean to do that, but my laptop is messed up or something. Anyway, I have been so busy that I haven't had time to call my friends or family. I have friends that go to this school but I never see them and hardly hear from them. I am so glad that I got a ticket to the OU game because I am one of the very few who doesn't have to wait in line. This reminds me of an assignment we had to do in high school. It was called power writing and we would have to write for two minutes about a topic and whoever had the most words at the very end won a prize. I was always the winner. People in the class would try to beat me and they never could. I guess I am just a fast writer. I really hope that it is okay that I pushed the submit button. It was an accident. I just figured out why that was happening and I think I fixed it. Just disregard the unfinished versions of this. I can't believe that I still have more than five minutes to keep typing. After this I still have so much to do tonight. I can't wait until this weekend so I can shopping and wash my car, but I still have to write a paper sometime during this break. also want to go out to eat while I am there. I haven't done that in a while. I accidentally pushed that button again I hope that it is okay. Anyway I am so tired and I really want to take a nap. I haven't gotten much sleep lately although I got more than I ever did in high school. In high school I got less sleep and did more physical work than I do now. I think my time is already up. 
__label__label0      I am really hungry right now. I think I'll go eat lunch in about twenty minutes or so since that's how long I have to sit here. I hope my classes this year won't be so hard. I want to be somewhere tropical maybe LOCNAME or LOCNAME. The weather here is ok but it's so hot. Like the other day I think I was going to pass out because I had to walk like 0 miles across campus and then I found out I was in the wrong building. Some of the people who work here are real jerks. The girl at the library was no help and she was rude to top it off. She told me to go to the help desk when I asked her how I got an IF account. I dont' miss that many people in LOCNAME. I do miss my parents and my dog Frida. I wonder how tommorow will go since it's Sept. 00. i hope no one pulls any stupid pranks or anything like that. I really wish I could be with my family but thats no possible since they live 0 hours away and I have classes. My cousins are so cute. I am looking at t picture of them right now. PROPNAME is a so elegant looking and PROPNAME's the quirky one. I feel bad for PROPNAME becau se she is losing her job. ORGNAME was bound to go under once ENgron did. I never kep up with that guy PROPNAME PROPNAME, the CEO for ENgron, or I think thats what he was. I miss seeing my dad and visiting him at his work. I wonder if I am depressed. Sometimes it's hard for me to sleep at night, but who knows. I have one, two three four, five six pictures in frrames in my room. My roommate just left for class. SHe is cool, but We have some conflicting religious beliefs. Being a mormon must be hard. I know the are ostracized alot. I justdon't get the spirit child thing about how we were spirit children in heaven with God before we were born. . or the part I read somewhere about how you have to wear holy underwear and things of that nature. TO me,that's just crazy,but I have to respect other people's religions and beliefs because that's what I expect from them in return. I am so hungry. I want to go eat. I wonder if I have gained any weight since I've been here. When I played soccer in highschool I was so much more muscular and toned. Now I have to find time to work out. Where is PROPNAME? I think is in her room or doing laundry. Her room mate is so nice, but I feel bad for her because of that PROPNAME guy she dated who just broke up with her. SHe is too nice. SHe's to pretty for him anyways. Some of the food inthe cafeteria scares me. I always hear horror stories about people eating food and finding things in what they are eating. Ughhhh. Now I'm not going to be hungry anymore. I don't have anything in here to eat except for fruit. I am sick of getting up at 0 in the morning to go to Spanish. My professor is ok, but he can be too sarcastic at times and I just want to yell. Yeah. so I am debating on whether I should do the Diamond Dolls. PROPNAME is in it and she said it was fun. PROPNAME would get mad though. I don't know. He may play baseball here next year, or thats what I think now. but I hope he does. My cold is annoying. What time does the mean lady at the front desk work? SHe is gripey. PROPNAME and her boyfriend fight alot. PROPNAME shouldn't tell them what to do but Ithink she just feels authoritative because that's how her stepdad seemed when I met him. Where am I going to eat tonight? Is Uncle PROPNAME back in town. That birthday card PROPNAME sent me was really sweet. I'm glad we have become closer than we used to be. I used to think we would never be close because we don't have that many of the same interests. SHe has lost weight. I wish I could lose 00 lbs. I am going to work out at 0. Then I will be back here at 0. take a shower, call Aunt PROPNAME and see when we are going to eat tonight. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are coming. that's good since I never see them . How far is PROPNAME from here? There is a really loud annoying girl who lives in my hall. She talks about crude things. I wonder if you can tell how smart I am by reading what I'm writing. I hope I don't sound like a fool. Who reads these things anyways. I like listening to PROPNAME. where is he? When is lunch over? Gosh I need to stop thinkng about food. That's not good. I don't want to be fat when I get olded. How many students does ORGNAME's law school take every year. I wonder if I could get in. I need to send those checks off so they don't expire. I am so wasteful sometimes. I need to get a book rack so my books and folders aren't thrown all over the floor. How fast does the fastest typer in the world type? I think I type like 00 words a minute. maybe I'm off. that was like years ago in BCIS. Tomorrow better be safe for everyone. I am cold. THe ac is on high. . yeas 
__label__label1    Yes, I'm finally in college. It feels wierd because ever sinse elementary school the teachers were trying to prepare you for college, my parents were trying to prepare me for college and I'm finally here. It feels good to go home every now and then because I feel important. Just hearing the girls in the hallway joking around and laughing outside of my dorm right now makes me love the sweet old college life even more. The smell from my basketball shoes brings back great times I've had in high school on the basketball team and makes me want to try out for the basketball team here at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME all of my clothes thrown around in my dorm give me the great feeling of independence from my mother. There is no one here telling me what to do like clean my room. I'm feeling really good about my classes and I'm trying to get over my habit of procrastination. I can't wait until the weekend comes because the music I'm listening to makes me want to go to the club and check out the girls and dance. I'm glad I'm in college because I here that it is going to be the best years of my life and so far it has been pretty fun.     
__label__label0 Well, lets see . . . I guess the foremost thing I have on my mind is moderate confusion about what exactly I'm supposed to be writing about. I guess that doubt and lack ORGNAME confidence about what I'm suppose to be doing is a part of my thoughts and what not and thus is appropriate to write about. Hehe, now I feel confident and more sure of this whole writing assignment. Wow, how quickly my entire psychological outlook can turn 000 degrees. What else?  Im not hungry or anything, not really tired tomorrow. Im a little worried about whether Im going to be awake enough to pay attention in my 0 o'clock class tomorrow. I'm also a little preoccupied by something someone said to me today, labeling me as too quite and inaggressive in committing myself to just about everything. I guess they might be right, I am a little hesistant to get involved in anything I think might not work out or turn out as I expect. I was thinking about rushing for a couple of frats, but then I realized I didnt even know what they were about. I was caught up in the promise of brotherhood and having fun and being a part of something special, but then I realized I didnt know what I was getting in to and that I might not be able to get out if I changed my mind. Thus, I decided not to rush, perhaps because of the fear of commitment and unfulfilled expectations that someone stated dictates most of my actions, or perhaps because I had a valid thought in suspecting I really don't know much about what precisely the fraternity actually did or stood for, who knows?  What else am I thinkin about?  How about how much longer Im suppose to be writing for. I've been writing nine minutes and I havent really noticed. This assignment isnt as bad as I thought it would be and is actually kind of nice. Almost like a diary of my thoughts; definately good for venting. Man, I sure hope this is what I'm suppose to be doing. I hope I didnt entirely miss the purpose of this assignment and not ger credit. I mean, Im writing about my thoughts and stuff, which seems to deal with Psychology and the human mind, so I think Im doing good here, but Im really not sure. Man, I'm getting a little behind in my reading. A lot of the lectures in many of my classes seem to cover the text exactly so Im a little unmotivated to read. I know I should and I know there is some extra information in the book, but really Im just lazy or something. To be honest, Im unsure of what I need to do to succeed in college. I've yet to take a test or quiz so I don't really know what the deal is. I know it is suppose to be harder than high school, or so many people tell me, but then again some people tell me its about the same as high school but with more reading. I don't know . . . . I know I should prolly be more focused on my studies but Im really cocky when it comes to academics. I know the ORGNAME of ORGNAME is a fine school with many intelligent students, but I still feel Im more capable than just about every one of them. I guess its part cockiness and part confidence. I don't think my attitude about the matter will be altered until I take my first test and totally mess it up. But if I just coast and do fine on the test, Ill keep on coasting. I mean, I pay pretty good attention in my classes and remember a lot, so I think I'll be okay. Ouch, someone just snuck up on me and smacked me. Can't they see Im trying to do my assignment?  How inconsiderate. I guess I would probably do the same. PROPNAME wants to hear that someone else is busy studying and doesn't have time to do anything even though all of us at some time or another must do the same and decline some invitation to some undoubtedly riveting event or activity in order to tend to less exhilirating, more educational ventures. Hey, only one minute left . . . maybe not, hehe, maybe I can still have some fun. Man, this writing assignment was tyte. It flew by in no time. Actually, I think I feel better now then I did before I started. How cool, if anyone ever read this, these writing assignments rock!

__label__label1 I have never been asked to do anything like this before. It is actually hard to think of anything to think about when you are asked to. This class seems as though it is going to be very interesting. Many people act in strange ways. Maybe this class will help me better understand that. I have a friend that acts in strange ways. Well, actually he use to be my boyfriend. It is so intersting to sit back and watch how he reacts to different things. He sometimes is so hateful and so mean to people for no reason. He has said so many mean things to me and the next day he is sorry for acting the way he did. But the funny thing is, he always ends up doing it again. My dad is somewhat the same way. But he seems more like he has a split personality. It is sometimes very scary. He can just snap sometimes and be a totally different person then he really is. Most of the time it is for no apparent reason. Maybe him being a heavy drinker has something to do with it. I also have a friend that doesn't know how to deal with her emotions too well. She goes literally crazy sometimes. One time I didn't answer my cell phone, and she left the most hateful voice mail. If you would have heard it, you would have thought she was crazy too. But when i confront her about it, she says sorry and can't explain why she did it. I seem to always be stuck in the middle of everything. No matter who is involved or what the situation is, my name always some how pops up. It is pretty aggrivating actually. And I have always lived my life to my dads standards. I never really get to worry about pleasing myself, because i always have to worry about pleasing my dad. My dad wanted me to be a cheerleader. So of course i worked my butt off to become one. He also wanted me to get in to UT. Don't get me wrong, i love it here. But the more i do want he wants the more he ask of me. None of his other children are asked to live up to his standards. 
__label__label1 I just had lunch, they actually had good cookies at the dobie cafeteria today. i'm really happy i found out that masha lives in dobie too, she kind of bothered me in high school, but i think i might like her now better than almost anyone i met. she's very sincere. i've been more happy than ever since i've been at ut only because i'm on my own. i feel no sense of homesickness at all, like most people are talking about, i'm the way i like myself without my mother who drives me crazy. i don't understand sometimes how in the world we're related. someone just came in. i love that feeling when you feel like your stuffed animals have personalities, the two dogs on my bed could easily be taken for real ones, well kind of, if one of them wasn't blue, maybe. but not really. alex and arif came by last night, two of my good friends from high school, it made me really happy; i was literally bouncing off the walls because i thought it was nice that they just came by unannounced; i don't know why it surprises me because i know they care about me, but when people i care about do something nice; it kind of surprises me. i could never keep a diary, i absolutely love writing more than anything in the world. i want to become a writer, but i always start with something and never finish or am honestly too lazy and that pisses me off a whole lot. i love it and i want to do it, but i don't know why i won't just do it. but diaries drove me crazy; i found myself being fake in them, i think it's easier to show your true self through other words rather than blatently posting,   i'm writing this about myself to understand myself   it doesn't work like that for me. you can see the real me through other writing i think . i downloaded this song called   forever   by ben harper. it is so good; it has the sweetest melody. it's very wierd; i sometimes write poems and just little phrases and i've noticed i use the color blue a lot. like the ocean is blue and once a poem about my parent's divorce and i used something about a blue world or something; i don't know where it comes from. my mother really drives me insane. her friends were in this past saturday and they came back amazed at my independence, how i looked, acted, just my persona and everything and they weren't like that  before about me. and i know that i do seem a little different; like a relief has been lifted off of me ; it's great. i like the person that i am. i spent too much time babying my mother, making sure i didn't say something to offend her or be upset because she was being ridiculous. and she told me how they though all of this and said it in such a way as to take credit for my development and for me being the way i am, sounding great and all. and i just wanted to scream that it is the opposite; it's only because she's not around. she can't seem to figure anything out for herself like that; she thinks she understands so much, but she doesn't at all and i think deep inside she knows she doesn't get it, but it just makes her feel better about herself to think that she understands it all, whatever it may be, just that she's in control, otherwise she wouldn't not let me stay out after ten some nights when all i did was go to a mmovie with my friends; she just does it to be in control and i wish she would see that she's only pushing me away and she already has; i don't think we will ever have a great relationship, not if she tries to understand me and herself. i just wish she could at least understand herself first. i don't want to be like her when i get older and that's partly why i don't want to agree with her on anything because by doing what she thinks she became the person she is and i don't want to be that person. that's sad and i don't like it, but it's just the way i think it is. i really want to go dancing. a song is playing that's called   just dance   and i want to do just that. 
__label__label0      i don't know well, why do i start with i don't know? i still don't know, haha. this is kind of fun, just like i'm typing with friends. but anyways, it's gona be a stressful day, or week next week, cause, well, schychology, however u spell that. it's gona be tough, 0 for the price of one, where's my other   A   then??? hehe. anyways, it's gona be alright. i think anything can be turned into a song, or just regular poems, they r lyrics. all lyrics are is that they have a tone to it, or a beat, or something like that. they are fun, and good way to show off little talent =) well, i guess it's kind of weird, first time when i have to type what i'm thinking off for a grade. what's up with that? and while i'm doing this, i'm thinking what to type, and what not to type, things that's too personal definatly can't be on here, but seriously, who's ever gona read this   crap   anyways? stream of concious, i'm gona wear my fingers out before   some body stop me  --Mask. haha. thinking about movies, it's kind of cool, thinking about girlfriend, and all the relationship i've had, which is quite interesting. and now back to school work, i guess. bus. major, tough deal, don't really know what i'm gona do, i really want to travel, make money, ofcourse, can't forget about the girls. but how am i going to succede when there's tons and tons of people just as talented as i am if not smarter??? what advantages do i have??? advantages, intersting. well, i'm smart, a little bit, and thoughtful, not too much of that times to times. adaptive, then whateles? i do love people, still think it's gona take a little time for me to acually get into the social scene. i'm built, have a good sense of humor, like to dance, a little bit of a   show off   and well. i'm thinking, it's kind of hard to be so complimentary towards self???. is my concious getting me??? haha. never!!!  what's concious anyways?? is it the things which never been said out of mouth, but knows deep inside? or is it   personal truth   of somewhat??? then questions come up, does everyone have a concious??? or is it just me having too much, haha. oh my. i looked up, and i can really type, or i can really think, or i can really think and type at the same time, and i make really terible jokes!!! haha. i laugh at myself, or such confidence yet pockets of insecurities. now i'm thinking, am i revewling too much on this thing? well, again, to emphasis on this point, NO ONE'S EVER GONA READ THIS!!! i do like psch, but never thought it be this way, i think i like philosophy better, yep. but then, it's kind of fun to know how i think, because i'm human, and i'm interested in everything about how it works. well, guess i'll take a break now, then to color, what color do i like? black, it's cool, it's dark, mysterous, and it's just a sense of honor, and sharpness to things. why am i talking so much about myself? am i self centered? am i selfish?? why!!! no. . . i don't want to be like this, i'm not, i refuse to be. . haha. well, why don't i use the rest of times to write a song,     it's raining outside  my mind suddenly flies  across the mountain  and over the ocean    well, maybe not, only 0 mins left. let's just leave it as that. to sit at my rhe. class, looking at the trees outside, i ask myself, are the branches moving, or is it this building. basically, i'm questioning my own truth, and my belief. or is it just that it's fun to be weird times to times??? but think about it, how do you know that water   
__label__label1 Well, you can tell it's Friday because there is no one in this computer lab. I'm very tired and ready to go to my car and go home. I don't know why I am so tired because I didn't do anything last night. I just got finished with my communications class. I am kind of worried about the interview because I'm not really an expert on anything. And we have to dress up. I walk around this campus all day and get gross, hot and sweaty. I don't want to dress up. My parter is little genius boy with a plan II and finance major. That kind of depresses me because I like to think of myself as smart, but everyone elses major seems much harder than mine. It's still a lot of work, but I just don't think I am as smart as I used to be. I am supposed to go home this weekend, but just don't feel like driving for two hours. Then next week we are going to LOCNAME for Dad's birthday. PROPNAME is thinking about going and I just know that PROPNAME is going to cause a big stink about us staying in the same room. And then what if they don't like PROPNAME. I know they won't like the earrings and they'll think he's too old and he works at the bar. It's just one thing after another. Never ending. I gave the lady that hit me the estimates for the damage. six hundred or fifteen hundred dollars. Which one would you choose?  That's another thing. I just got my car back, barely had it for two months, and some country club bitch that can't drive has to hit me. I don't even care about my car anymore. I don't feel like waiting for it to get fixed. I used to obsess about my car, but too many things have happened to it.   Today is Friday the 00th. Kind of spooky. Sometimes I am more superstious than other times. I still want a black cat thought. Wednesday was the Sept. 00 World Trade Center anniversary. It was a sad time of course, but I'm getting tired of thinking and hearing about it. I know we just can't forget about it because it's on every t. v. and every newspaper cover every time you turn around, but I think people are too worried about it. I know I was somewhat scared that something was going to happen on wednesday.   PROPNAME keeps calling me and I haven't answered the phone yet. I feel bad because he keeps saying that he just wants to see how I'm doing and if everything is going o. k. , but I really know what he wants. Booty call. It's a good thing to still have those connections, but I so over that right now. Right now I'm into PROPNAME and I don't want to do anything to hurt him. I've  already done that enough. I'm still shocked that he was married. I knew it in the back of my mind, but now that he admitted it, it's different. That was such a long time ago. When he was 00 years old. I was in the seventh or eighth grade. Sometimes you just have to make mistakes and learn from them.   PROPNAME wants me to call him this weekend while I'm home. I might. I'm not sure about that either. He's a great friend, but he tries to hard sometimes. Of course, I have't told him that I'm seeing any one either. We'll see how that goes.   I'm really worried about my essay for my art history class too. I haven't read any of the book yet. It's a really boring book, but I have to do it. Add it to the list for this weekend.     
__label__label1 Man, i have to do this writing assignment. what a waste of time. i could be sleeping right now. i am so tired. stupid 0:00 classes. i don't want to go to class anymore. that door is really loud. i wonder if the cleaning woman is done cleaning the bathroom. i really have to go. oh well, i can wait 00 minutes. i wonder why 00 minutes is so relative to this assignment. sigh. i can't think of anything to type. pretty blank right now. what's on tv. looks like some big guy doing a hefty exercise. OH MY GOD!  that guy's huge!  picking up kegs. that's strength, right there. i wish is was that strong. that would be really cool. too bad it takes forever to develop that. results would be nice. all that working out at the gym. that's a nice looking road. oh, union pacific. oh, lindsay's responding to my aim. she fell asleep. figures. she's always tired. why am i so bitter about this breakup. i mean we said we were going to be friends. if we're friends then why do i find myself mad at her all the time. i think she doesn't like being around me anymore, despite what she says. girls are so complicating. she could at least be up front about it if she didn't want to hang out anymore. i think this whole ordeal is destroying our chances of getting back together. whatever. i miss her though. or is it her that i really miss?  maybe i just miss having a girlfriend. someone to hold and appreciate. i wonder if. what are you talking about josh. whatever. where was i. oh yeah, girlfriends. world's strongest man. raise your hand, you kow it. raise your hand. damn, this tv's too loud. i can't think. raise your hand. 000 percent. if you're sure. chicken tenders. kick out of dinner tonight. tonight on sports center. what makes realationships so complicated. i see my other friends who are couples and they appear to be fine. steven and katy look like they'rein love with each other. that'll never last. steven't shouldn't be treated like that. and katy needs someone more independent, not a luzy hobo. whatever. at least they have a relationship. man, PROPNAME's got it good. he just picks up girls so easily. people like to be around him. plus he's got erin back home he can go back to for some loving. i miss loving. those were some good days. that's prob why things never worked out with lindsay. she prob wanted something more in the relationship. but what?  i always took her out on dates. . made her feel special. and i slip up one time on my birthday. damnit. why did i have to act that way. i hate when i do that. but one mistake was all it took for thing to go sour. pennebaker?. yeah that's his name. uh. damnit!  i'm so bitter. i really should cool down if i'm ever going to get back in another relationship. who knows how long that'll be. there's a couple girls in band. my gracious!  they are hot!  that would be some sweet loving there i must say. but then there's the guilt of lindsay. there's a neverending trap. what if she still wants back into the relationship?  i know she told sarah that it's a possibility later on this year, but should i really wait for her?  did she really mean that much to me?  of course she did, or i would've broke up with her a long time ago. but why do i feel differently now?  what makes now so different than the past. i guess things get old over time, and changes must be made. looks like i took the first step by breaking up. i guess i should just move on. we'll see. oh, time's up. oh but i can still write. hmm. well i guess i'm done. i want to sleep before band practice anyway. man, why do we have to go off campus. they make things so difficult. 
__label__label1      Today is a dreary day. The clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. I think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. I almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. I don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if I just think it is because that is what i have always thought. I want to be quiet. silent. Reflective because I need some time to think and not be social. I don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. I think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. I need to go to that church that PROPNAME went to , but I don't know how to get there and I feel bad that I didn't go today, even though I went to bed at 0. I need to do a better job next week. I really am begining to miss PROPNAME and my family. Living in LOCNAME is fun but I think I am going to get sick of it if I don't take charge of my life now. I want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. I want to be different and I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for. I still haven't found what I'm searching for. It is really hot in here. I wish I could turn the air down. but PROPNAME is asleep. She is so crazy. I guess I like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. But i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if I am not careful. I really want to go shopping but I don't have time. Maybe tomorrow. I want to buy so many things. I have so many ideas but I have no money. Whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. I could have so much fun if I had a whole bunch of money. I would go to all the vintage stores in LOCNAME and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. I think then I would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? I wish that I was bulletproof. I wish PROPNAME was here. We could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. We need each other. He can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. And i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. It would be so great. Oh well, i don't think that will happen. Last nite was soo crazy. But I am glad I went, just because I need to experience all that I can so I can really know what I stand for and am comfortable with. If I just stay here and do things I know, then I will never be sure if I am really being real, or just what I think is real. I need to try everything so i will  know what I'm not missing. or what I need to get more involved in. I hope PROPNAME, ORGNAME and I can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. I think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. I can't belive I cut myself on my bed today. That is so retarded. And it really hurts. I think PROPNAME is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how PROPNAME and PROPNAME live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. Haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. I can't belive it. I love ORGNAME. it is so comforting. At least I don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. It is a strange feeling but I really like it. It's like, i can do anything and no one will know if I don't want them to. That is a eerie and almost scary feeling. Sometimes, when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. I am tempted to think there are no little things.  I hope PROPNAME will write me a song sometime. He really needs to. I can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. I wonder if I just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. I would think that naturally he would, but then again I can rarely predict him. He would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. That is sad. I really wish he would be different . He has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. Ahh. ohh well, it will work out. I am glad i have him, because I don't want anyone else,. . no one. I a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. Well, this is almost the end. The end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. I have so much to do today. I love this music. I want to paint. I need to create something beautiful, and be productive. This is actually the beginning. not the end. Here I go. this is going to be one great year. I have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep. 
__label__label1 It's late and the fan is on it keeps spratically blowing on my arm. My arm is getting kind of cold. I have been reading for about an hour now and my eyes are kind of lazy. I have some catching up to do on my homework and i need to go get a book tomorrow, the one i got online was the wrong one. today was a long day, i'm glad it's over. three classes and a long work-out session. i like it though, the working out, it make me feel. . . good. i like to feel good. tomorrow is going to be an easy day. ony one class. my nails look bad i sure need a manicure. the fan is really relaxing with the blowing and the hum sound it makes. there is no other noise, usually there is a radio playing but not tonight, homework was the important thing. i want to do several things this week, attend some meetings for soccer and for this business fraternity that i want to be in. i think it will be fun to be involved with the school. i sure wish i could find some information on the football or baseball spirit groups. thats really what i want to do. i love watching ut play no matter what sport. i was athletic in high school i wish i would have listened to my dad when he said   you should practice, you could get a scholarship   i could have, the demand for girl golfers is pretty high. i didn't listen oh well can't cry over spilt milk. i miss my parents, i know they miss me. my mom calls alot but im glad she calls me because i would fell kind of foolish is i always called home. you know, everytime i visit i get teary eyed. i know that sounds stupid but its getting better though. i love this school though, the only school i ever wanted to go to. been a fan forever. everyone else in my family is an aggie. i will be the first longhorn in family history. pretty cool i think. i wish i could do more with my room. its too small and my closet. man i have no words for that. but i like it here, its close to school and everything else for that matter. the walking across campus kind of sucks but thats ok because its ut campus, that makes all the difference in the world. i can't believe i got into the business school. i still remember finding out like it was yesterday. i was completely speachless. literaly i had to go outside, it was one of the most liberating and self gratifying moments of my life. i am smiling right now. i have alot of pictures of my friends in my room, i miss them too. mainly my best friend PROPNAME, she is getting married in november and i hate that i am not there to help her out with all the wedding stuff, she calls and i always do what i can while i am at home but its not the same. we were neighbors you know. for the better part of out childhood. i am usually not this depressing sounding. i guess its the long day and all the prior homework setting the mood. my arms are starting to hurt because i am typing with my comp on a stool by my bed, sitting on the edge. its a strange position but i havent yet got me a desk. . like i said the room is small and well my comp desk was big. well good night.         
__label__label0      It comes easy just to type out what I am thinking, I am used to keeping a thourogh journal. It didnt necessarily have written sections like a   dear diary   but had many ideas and thoughts expressed in art. I really do love art. The communications school has a fantastic creative program which I hope to become a part of. It a rigorous comittment that i feel fully qualified for. That is my own concieded thought. Anyways, college has been everything I expected for and more. My professors are interesting and the social scene is very entertaining. I still find myself getting sad at nights because I am not with some of my closest friends. PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME. . some kids that are really special to me and its really sad not seeing them everyday. I also see myself getting sad that i can not see my parents everyday. I talk to them quite alot but its not the same. It kind of scares me too since my mom is going through alot, and batteling cancer, and my inconsiderate brother takes no responsibility in the family. It was supposed to be my year at college my time to be   off duty   and my brother thinks its appropriate to go and work in the LOCNAME. I have such ill feelings for that boy. Besides that. I mean life goes on. You can't get stuck in a rut. you got to live each day as it comes. There has been some drama in my   new   life here at LOCNAME. It is all a bunch of dumb girls who think they know what they are talking about and they really dont. I am a pretty chill, I am not a competer. ill quit before the race begins just because i don't care about things that much. And especially with guys, I am not the type of girl to be a homewrecker. And for Petes sake I am only 00- a freshman- its not like the people we have found this week are going to be our soulmates for life. PROPNAME- the girl whose giving me the worst vibes in the world thinks she can call dibs on every guy- who is she to do that??? whatever- again i don't compete- take them all and be happy- i am too worried about my grades and other things that are improtant to me. This writing assignment is actually pretty cool. Its like a way to vent out whats on your mind and get a grade for it. It is really hot in my dorm room right now, and the cd i was listening to is over, PROPNAME PROPNAME, what a good cd. I think my car phone is broken too and its like the fourth one i have gone through- I got these cute pictures today at tops photo. i am really getting into the swing of things here at LOCNAME and its really comforting. I came with alot of friends. some who i didnt reallly want to hang out with some I did- I have met alot of cool cool peeps and i am definatly having a good time. Its really hard to find something to talk about with there is one minute left----  
__label__label1      Today is Friday and I am feeling sad because my I had been hoping to see my boyfriend PROPNAME this weekend. Actually, originally I had planned to see him next weekend because this weekend he was supposed to be going to PROPNAME PROPNAME. But then his trip to PROPNAME PROPNAME got cancelled and I was hoping that he would be able to come up and visit me. But it just wasn't going to happen in this short of notice because we had too many other things going on this weekend. But next weekend I will see him because I am driving down to LOCNAME next Friday. I am so excited because by then it will have been three weeks since we last saw eachother. Next Sunday, September 00 is his brothers' birthday. He has two brothers, they are twins. Their names are PROPNAME and PROPNAME. They will be turning 00. This weekend I am going to buy them birthday cards. The only problem is that I'm not sure which name to put on one of the cards because now PROPNAME wants to be called Hunter for no particular reason. So I want to be nice and call him by the name he wants to be called, but I also think that those kind of nicknames are dumb. By that I mean nicknames that are derived from nowhere. A nickname should contain at least some semblance of the person's actual name. But I want to be nice to his brother. I am very tired right now. I didn't get enough sleep last night, I stayed up late talking to my roommate about the most random stuff. I had planned to take a nap after my 00:00 class, but I got sidetracked, and I had that guilty feeling that I should be studying. So I went to the library and studied a little bit. And now it is 0:00 on Friday afternoon and I really have nothing to do. That has been a common theme during my two-week college experience so far: having nothing to do. My roommate is one of my best friends from high school, and all senior year we were so excited about coming to college. And I really like it here a lot, but I guess it takes awhile for things to pick up. But I have been meeting a lot of people in the dorm and some people in my classes. At first I was unbelievably homesick, it came in waves. I'd be ok for awhile, and then all of a sudden something would remind me of PROPNAME or home or my parents or something and I'd feel like I wanted to cry. Now that things have settled into sort of a routine I feel better. And I know it just takes time. I can sort of gauge everything that happens to me during college to what happened to my brother, because when he started college he was in the same situation I am in - he was in a long distance relationship. But he went to ORGNAME. Also, his girlfriend was still in high school, and my boyfriend is the same age as me. But he was miserable, I remember how sad he was. He used to come home every weekend. But he was in College Station, only about an hour from home. Anyways, I wouldn't even want to be like that. I don't want to seem like I can't handle things and I have to run back to PROPNAME all the time. But I really miss him and I have this lost feeling, like I'm not sure what to do with myself. My roommate went downstairs to get her laundry. She had a little package slip in the mail too. PROPNAME said that I should check my mail today and I did, but I didn't get anything, so I don't know what he's talking about. It's a very cloudy day today. I am supposed to do this homework assignment for my astronomy class where I have to observe the sky and measure the angles of different stars. So I hope it clears off later. The other problem is I can't find a place from where I can do it. At first I thought I would just go to the top of the Jester parking Garage, so I did that last night, but it wasn't tall enough - I couldn't see the horizon behind all the tall buildings and stuff. So I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do about it. It is actually stressing me out, because I just don't know what to do. I hope I will figure out something this weekend. The homework is not due until Thursday. But I'd rather get it over with. My roommate just came back and said that I did have a letter from PROPNAME. That is weird because I checked the mail earlier and there was nothing for me. So I'm excited now. Now she is folding her laundry. I did my laundry yesterday. It is so expensive, 00 cents a load. That is why I'm going to take my laundry home next weekend.   
__label__label0  yes, here i am, finally. I never thought i would be doing this, ever. This is so weird. it's so weird, whenever i'm under any type ofpressure, i can never type well. it's so weird. but it's probably pretty common. everyone gets underpressure. i hate it thoguh. because i never feel like i'm  a good typist. i never was though. even when first started learning in 0th grade. i was always the last one to finish my lines, or whatever. 0th grade. that was so long ago. i was just thinking about that the other day. i remember that was a grade of so many changes. i just realized that i'm very nostalgic. i constantly look back on my past. maybe that's becasue i was sexually abused as a child. it's weird. i just read a quote a couple of weeks ago that said   life can can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.  That's so true. because i believe that everything in anyone's life, the way they are, their personality, their mannerisms, their characteristics, everything- stems from childhood. if someone is abused as a child, they will either become an abuser themself, or even worse, a serial killer, or they will spend the rest of their life dealing with it as best they can, praying to god that it will never happen again to them, or anyone else they love. that's me, i think. i'm obviously not going to abuse myslef, nor bacome a serial killer. i don't think. haha. no, i'm just kidding. don't worry, it's weird how one's thoughts wander, isnt it? i could never picture myself being a serial killer. i just hate dead bodies. they make me have nightmares. well, not really. but after i saw that movie, seven. . oh my gosh. i think my brain even squirmed. it was a good plot, though. i will admit that. that's another thing. you know how people criticize people like eminem and marilyn manson, and other outreagous people in the media? sometimes they can't help their success. sometimes they are just stopped on the street, and some exec says, hey i wnat to make money off of your emotions. and that's just what they do. they make huge names out of these people just so they can money, and then the stars themslves are happy because they can express themselves and they make money. so tehir success is just plain luck ,a lot of the time. so you can't always blame those peolpe for their success. blame the people that signed them. . okay, my 00 min are up, so i'm going to go now. wow, this was very theraputic , in a way. i'm goi g to make chicken parmesan tonight!! yum!!     
__label__label0      No heather I did not put your picture up, I don't know why! No I didnt wash it. I really like Fight club, I don't know why, actually I do. Why did I even say i don't know why, itsd amazing the things you get use to saying so that you will fit in. Anyways, I am trying to meet people, and its cool. I use the xcuse that other people haven't been open and maybe they were not, but at the same time, I knowe I am not as openas I was last year. Ireally liked my senior year, it went by pretty fast, and I got to do alot of the things that I like to do and wanted to do. I also have really wanted to see my girlfriend and, yea, Im debating wether I want to stay at our status of going out exclusively, or whether or not, we should also see other people. Would marrying her be all that bad, maybe, or maybe Im just sexually attracted to her. I have been playing computer games alot and I have also been studying alot more. You know something that interesting, is that people are always looking forward to stuff and never enjoying the present. Do we ever really enjoy the present. Sex is cool in the present, and I guess you look forward to that and you also look forward to eating, so maybe we are more like animals than people think. Maybe we really arent that advanced. I wonder how much different we are from animals. Which brings me to evolution, evolution makes so much sense to me, doesn't it to you? Do i need peoples approval on everything?!! we are very gregarious creatures, how can therebe a GOD, how can there not be I don't know, but I doubt it alot of the time and take things that people might set aside as miracles as simply co incedence. I wonder if Im studying enouph, or is there such a thing. Do I just want to mak the grade or do I actually want to learn. I think knowing, I mean really remembering all that you study would be aswome. I think the coolest characters in story are highly intellegent. Like Grand adimeral thrawn, the most intelegent, incredibly intellegent bad guy. HE could wipe out whole civilizations and even galaxies, by simply outhinking them, by studying their psychological weaknesses and then exploiting them to take control of them, He did so by being incredibly knoledgeable on his subject matters. He knew something on every topic, and wasd therefor nearly undeafeatable, he didnt need to see the future, he could see it through their minds and the way they reacted to different sittuations. Are women evil, is all they care about is guys, I mean really what is there purpose in the grand scheme of things. All they ever do is complain, there is always something wrong with them, they only care about themselves, and they backstab each other all the time. They're frekin evil. They're all about appearences, nothing is as it seems with them, I mean what the hell is wrong with them, don't they have any loyalty towards each other, all they evercare to do is kill each other over. Are people only angry at the people like them, because they can see through them, they see what these similar people are doing, and hate that they exploit people the same way that they do. Is that all we do, exploit other people, is there such a thing as love. Or is it just made up, or is love just a selfish thing to benefit yourself. I mean I want to be unselfish and I want others to be unselfish, is that even possible. Is everyone like everyone else, are there any individuals, or is it just a giant struggle to be unique and cool. Why are we here, is there a purpose to this big mess, I mean what are we supposed to do, what is the purpose of having life if all you will have is eventuall death, why did life create itself, and how is it that your cells retain thoughts. I mean how do your cells keep your thoughts, I don't understand that. I mean how do they work together to keep your thoughts and memories. The brain is such an interesting thing and it is very amazing indeed, and I would like to know about everyone elses brain sooo I could, use that information, I would like to have as much knowledge as grand adimeral thrawn, but then again who would'nt isnt that interesting, how alike we really are, and that we are in deed a product of our parents enviroment. 
__label__label0    I'm not really sure what exactly I'm supposed to do with this. There is some guy in my room that keeps trying to talk to me and I don't know him. I wonder why he's in here. Theres a really old song playing on the radio. I havent heard it in a while. it reminds me of 0th grade. Every song does that, takes me back to a different place in time. Now this song reminds me of my friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wonder what they're doing right now. I miss my old friends. I'm really excited about this weekend. LOCNAME is going to be a blast. I just hope that everything works out. I really want to suprise PROPNAME, but if I have to tell him I'm coming I guess I will. I really don't want to. That guy won't shut up. I'm thinking I might just take a cab from the airport to the university. My dad said theres a tropical storm. I sure hope it disentigrates before I get there. I hope everything works out with PROPNAME, though. I think this weekend is going to be the deciding factor of our relationship. Things are so tense every time we talk. I want to go back to that last night at his house. . it was so amazing. We stayed up the enitre night watching the meteor shower and talking out on his balcony. one of those moments I will never forget even when I'm old. I wonder what I will be like when I'm old. I want to be a cool grandma. I want to live in a big old house on some land but drive a really badass car and cook good food for m grandkids and spoil them. I guess b efore I  have grandkids, I have to have kids. which I don't want to do. I was watching the learning channel and MAN having those babies has to hurt. I could just have a c section. Thats what my aunt did. But then she died of cancer. Maybe I shouldnt have one. This cough is getting really old. I always get colds. Last time I had one was before me and John met though. HE brought me flowers for the first time. White dasies on the red tahoe outside of my room. I miss that. The note said he didnt have any soup. flowers would have to do. I love that. If I could right now, i would fly to miami and marry this boy. i remember the day my sister got married. It was the most beautiful thing i've seen. OF COURSE I WOULD DO IT DIFFERNETLY IF IT WAS MY WEDDING&gt; OK NOW MY COMPUTER IS FREAKING OUT&gt; UMMM I don't KNOW WHAT I DID BUT IT won't QUIT! OK THIS IS GOING TO BOTHER ME SO MUCH&gt; I HATE THAT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU don't KNOW HOW TO FIX IT&gt; SOMETIMES THESE THINGS ARE JUST TOO SMART FOR THEIR OWN GOOD&gt; MY EYE ITCHES BUT I can't ITCH IT&gt; WIERD&gt; I WONDER WHY YOU can't ITCH INSIDE&lt; BUT IT ITCHES ANYWAYS&gt; HMM&gt; I WONDER WHY YOUR FOOT WILL JUST FALL ASLEEP ALL OF A SUDDEN AND YOU can't WAKE IT UP&gt; WHY DO THEY SAY IT FELL ASLEEP? IT SMELLS LIKE PEANUT BUTTER IN MY ROOM BECAUSE MY ROOMATE IS MAKING A PB&J SANDWICH&gt; I  M HUNGRY NOW TOO&gt; I COULDNT EAT AT OLIVE GARDEN EARLIER BECAUSE I WAS COUGHING TOO MUCH&lt; BUT NOW ITS A LITTLE BETTER&gt; I SHOULD TRY TO EAT SOMETHING&gt; I WISH THERE WAS JUST A PILL THAT YOU COULD TAKE THAT WOULD BE FOOD&gt; IT WOULD BE A UNIVERSAL THING&gt; FOOD TAKES UP SO MUCH OF OUR TIME AND LIVES&gt; WE WOULD LIVE CHEAPER&lt; HAVE MORE TIME TO DO OTHER THINGS&lt; AND PROBALY WOULDNT HAVE SO MANY OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE&gt; THATS A GOOD IDEA&gt; I THINK IM GOING TO COME UP WITH ONE OF THOSE&gt;&gt;&gt; 
__label__label0      My roommate is throwing gummy bears at me. My favorite flavor is the pineapple ones. My roommate is rambling. Pineapples make me think of he beach. The LOCNAME. White sand, clear water. I am thirsty. I don't drink enough water during the day. I hear slaming doors, faint radio tunes threw the walls. My window is huge and the view is of a tree. I hear water flowing. My feet are cold. They are always cold. The enter key keeps getting stuck on the keyboard. I need to grease it I guess. I hate greasy fried foods. Dinner tonight was not to great in LOCNAME. I hear a cell phone ringing. I wish I had more minutes on my cell phone. I see the room phone ringing now. The door just opened. Tulips are my favorite flower. They only grow during certain seasons. I with I had tulips. They don't last as long as roses or carnations. PROPNAME O's flower is a carnation. Carnations are funeral flowers. Why does it always rain at funerals. I haven't been to a funeral in several years. I can't spell. The shift key keeps getting stuck too. I hope I get to be on the Diamonds. I need to apply. I miss PROPNAME. He is coming soon. I hope he gets here early. I wonder how PROPNAME did on her interview. I am sure she was fantastic. I hope she liked LOCNAME better. I hear cars outside. My feet are freezing. I have socks on. my socks are dirty. There are grammer mistakes in this writing. I hope I get to go to church Sunday. I miss my old church. I need to pray more. Man Im glad we are still friends. The game is going to be fun. Do i need to get there early. I wonder where my cousin lives. I wonder what he would have cooked for us. What ever it was, I'm sure it would have been better than what I ate. I can't believe he called me. When will I go home. When will I find a place i like to study. When will this place feel homey. I need to cut my nails. It is hard to type. I need a pedicure too. Ther're my favorite. I like the chairs you sit in. They put me to sleep. I never know how much to tip the woman that works on my nails. My back doesn't hurt. I can't believe it. This chair is hard. I liked stud    
__label__label0      I feel tired and sleepy. I feel that I just want to go to sleep right now. I feel this assignment is making me sleepier. I also feel pain in my stomach and want to do something about it. I feel that I just want to get up go to sleep. I feel that this assignment is boring and really unnecessary. I feel like my stomach is going to explode. I also feel a little stress because of all the things that I want to accomplish today with the little time to do it. I feel that this assignment is never going to end and that my thoughts are just blank right now. I want to get up and go do the things that are really important. My body aches from moving around too much. My stomach still feels like it's going to explode and I can't do anything about it. I'm thinking that I want to call my sister see how everything is going. I talked to her yesterday and it made feel good because I have been feeling kind of homesick and depressed. She is like my life advisor because she is always helping me out with stuff. I feel like I've through a whole semester of school work and I just want to take a vacation and relax and play basketball all day long. Playing basketball is the only thing lately that makes feel good. I play a lot but I get tired quick so I can't always play to my full potential. Sometimes I just don't want to do anything else during the day so I could just play basketball I work on my game. I wish that I could play all day long and never have to worry about anything else. Right now I'm thinking if the major I chose is the right one for me. I don't know if I'm cut out for business. Sometimes I feel like I want to devote my time to writing screenplays and playing basketball. I feel like the whole world is holding me back from doing so. Sometimes I feel like doing something drastic and just drop out of school and live in southern LOCNAME, a place that I absolutely love. I also wish I could transfer out of here. I never really wanted to be here. There's too many people with far different attitudes and goals than mine. I wish I was attending college in the northeast, but I would only pursue that if I were sure what I want my major to be. I don't a like a whole lot of things here now that I think about it. I was hoping my attitude about this stupid school would change once I got here but it hasn't. I knew I was going to feel depressed when I came here and that's exactly how I feel. Things are moving too slow and I want them to move fast. I'm impatient right now because I feel I have been patient for too long. Having an anti-social, computer nerd for a roommate doesn't help much either. His attitude and introvertedness sometime irritates me. I wish I had a different roommate. I feel that school screwed me with this. Now I feel that I really wish that I could transfer. I just want to be in a better environment, hopefully somewhere I could find people like me.   
__label__label1 Today I woke up feeling completely gross and sick!I knew it was a mistake to go out and party last night when I knew I was coming down with something but I couldn't stay in my dorm room for another second~! My roomate is already driving me crazy and I am sick and tired of all men! where do they get off thinking they can use me and other women at there disposal. Does ben really think his life is so much more important than mine or more difficult because he is going to med school. His life  could be a lot more rough! Aah, what was I thinking he's not really even my type I don't have time for another boyfriend/heartbreak! How could he sit there and tell me I am the perfect woman for him but just not right now! Like I am supposed to sit around on my ass and wait for him, I don't think so. Gosh there is so much to do this weekend. Laundry, homework, visit with PROPNAME, suck up to my Dad and if that's not enough we had to add being sick and on my period to the list! Like I don't have enough to deal with. I wonder If PROPNAME is ever going to quit smoking, you think that the prospect of having children would be enough to make her quit but it's not. I wonder why thats the case. HOw can smoking be that addictive that it can stop you from bringing another human llife in to the world? I wonder why she started smoking in the first place. It will be cool when she has kids of her own to see what they turn out to be like? I wonder if I'll be there cool Aunt PROPNAME, I kind of like the sound of that! I'm still typing away in my dorm room it feels like such a sauna in here. Our suitmates our constantly turning off the air. What's wrong with them? Do they like to sweat. My roomate is such a rotten brat! It's so obvious she is an only child suffering from   only child syndrome  . She acts and talks to me like I'm her mother/maid. Oh well, I won't be seeing to much of her starting next week. Swim lessons start, and I'll be really busy studying and working. I still have a lot of reading to do for my children's literature class. It's such a fun class. Getting a grade for reading childrens books! The teacher cracks me up you can definetly tell she used to be a librarian. When she danced the other day in class I thought I would exploded! So my times almost up and I feel like I am rambling now, and my hands are begining to hurt. I'm not used to all of this typeing! I should probably call the woman at the ORGNAME after this I have been meening to do that and just haven't gotten around to it! Gosh so many thigs to do!                                 
__label__label1     Today, i started the day with a serve headache. All day long this feeling has been with me from my first class to work to homework. In the early months i was told that i had a tumor near my pitutary gland. Ever since then I was put on some medication to help dissolve this tumor. Friday, i was schedule to have a MRI done, well today the result came back. As the doctor reported, i the medicine is working well. I just have to keep taking the medication. What a big relief. I felt great that i will not have to have surgery to remove the tumor. But lately, i have had headache that hurt realyy bad. When i toldmy mother, see thought i sgould get me eyes checked. She thinks that i need glasses. Who knows? I hope not. MAn, my brother is in the 0th grade and they required him to buy a recorder. Yes, he does not know how to play it. So it just sounds like a bunch of noise. This is what I hear in background as well as the loud tv that is showing commericals. I feel sleepy. Actually i don't know if there is time in which i am not sleepy. I work alot as a server and then get to come to do some homework before i fall asleep. So not much gets done. I wish there was just a day were i could relax, do something fun and not have to worry about what is due tomorrow, next week, in a couple of months get my drift. i know we just had a summer vaction. Well, i took summer school for the second half. so it feels like i have been in school for a couple of months. College is so much different from high school. Alot of responsibility is on the student. It is very easy to miess up. So far, i try to take one think at a time. It is hard to jugle 00 things at once, even if they are not school related. I deal with school, work ,friends, family and down time for myself which is usually the gym. One thing that i do miss is dealing with the boyfriend. After 0 0/0 yrs, i decided to break it off. I felt that i needed some breathing room. But there have been days were i miss  him. At those times, i just want him back but then i see that i can't just go and come when i want too. it is not fair to him. Lately i have been feeling lonely, very lonely. Especially since i don't see my friends as often because i live off campus, at home. Which means that i have some what of a curfew. Plus to travel from my house to campus is 00-00 way. Any way i really don't have time. This guy took very good care of me. I know, so why did i leave. Well he treated our relationship as we were, married. I could not even talk to friends with =out him geeting jealous or us getting a arguement. He wanted to spend all his free time with me and expected me to do the same. Well, i appreicate my friends and he did'n see that. 
__label__label1         Lately, I have been having all sorts of feelings. All my life I have lived in LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME and now moving to LOCNAME feels so different. I feel so lonely because I barely have any friends in LOCNAME and I am to shy to approach people. Hopefully my year will get better. I don't think that my roomate is too fond of me. I don't understand why she barely talks to me? I try to be friendly. All I do all day is read or call my friends back in LOCNAME LOCNAME so that I don't feel lonely. It's odd really that I talk to my mom quite often on the phone.    On top of that I have problems with my boyfriend. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I am having serious trust issuses. I have been with him for four years and I should be able to trust him, but he lives so far away and i don't get to see him much. How do I know if he's doing any thing behind my back? Should I even think like this? Does he trust me? I really do love him. Only recently did I discover that I love him. I wonder if the two of us will ever be together in the future. I really hate my culture when it comes to this kind of stuff. Why do we have to have arranged marriages? What is the point in that?       I hope I do well in school this year. Last year I got good grades, but i really want to make my parent sproud. I feel bad fo rthem really. They pay so much money for my education and living. I feel as though I owe it to them to make them proud after all that they do for me. I really should get a job, but my schedule really doesn't allow me to. I'm not done with class till 0 everyday and I start the day as early as 0. Hopefully next year my schedule will be better and I can get a job and take on some responsibilities for myself.    Living away from home is so different. It's strange really. I didn't think that I would miss home so much. I was so glad to finally leave and be on my own and have freedom. I don't even know where anything is in LOCNAME and I hate bothering the people that I do know in LOCNAME for directions. I don't know if it bothers them that I keep calling.     Maybe I should join a sorority or something so that I can meet more people. I wonder if I can even handle being in a sorority with school work though.      I can't believe I actually decided to change my major. From computer science to nursing, wow that's a big change. Well all I know is that I want to do something dealing with kids because I love kids and they usually love me. I don't want to be a teacher and not a doctor because that is way to much schooling for me. I think being a pediatric nurse will give me the oppurtunity to interact with children and help them. If only my mom would be happy with the decision I made. I don't know what her problem is anyways. It's my life, I should be able to do what I want and what make me happy.     To tell you the truth about what i am thinking at the moment right now, I am really scared about this writing assignment my hands are shaking and I have no idea why. It should be easy for me like writing in my diary . I guess it's because of the fact that I am going to be graded on it. O well, hopefully I do well.     I'm really tired and my back is hurting me and my time is almost up, so goodbye i'm going to sleep.           
__label__label1   I am so glad it is Friday. I am going home because my friend is also going home and his parents are out of town, so he is going to have some parties. I know it will be fun. I am also going to get to watch my brothers football game. He is a senior this year, and from what he has told me he is doing good in football. I only live an hour away from LOCNAME so I don't have a long drive. It could be long though if ILOCNAME00 is bad. I just go North on 00 until I get to Temple so I am happy about that because I don't have far to go. I also miss my boyfriend who I will get to see tonight also. We have been going out for 0 months now, which is definately a record for me. I sometimes ask myself what in the world is wrong with me?  All my friends and my parents also ask me that same question. I just tell them I have no idea. He is a real nice guy though, and will do anything for me. He pays for everything and takes me anywhere I want to go or do. I do not like LOCNAME much, but i love ORGNAME. I know that is weird but I'm not much of a city girl. I hate all the traffic and the weird people. That is why I love going home because it is out in the country. We have trees and ponds surrounding us and not huge buildings. It is also a lot more peaceful out in the country and you don't have the sounds of cars or big rigs. I like the apartment I am living in this year. I have three other girls as roommates and it is a lot of fun. They are also from a small town so we get a long really well. Last year I lived in the dorms and I hated them. I lived in LOCNAME LOCNAME and they were real nice for a dorm but I didn't like them because I didn't have a kitchen or my own privacy. It really just didn't feel like home. My apartment is a lot better mainly because it is bigger. Well I wonder what I am going to do this weekend. Probably go to Cole's and do some homework and read. I want to float the river, I know I can talk Cole into doing that with me. Cole is my friend coming into town because his parents are out of town.  He plays baseball for PROPNAME PROPNAME in LOCNAME. His sister also goes there and she plays volleyball, and throws the shot and disk in track. There is also a guy from my school that plays basketball there. I actually live in LOCNAME LOCNAME- LOCNAME. Which is about 00 minutes outside of Temple. We are a 0A school and we won the basketball state championship last year. It was an awesome experience. It was the first time we had won state in any sport. We got second place in 0000, we lost to PROPNAME by like 00 points. Well I think I am going to take a shower and eat and then leave LOCNAME so I can get home in time to go to my brothers pep-rally. I talked to him last night and he said he was going to get to participate in the pep-rally so that starts at 0:00, so I'm probably going to leave in about an hour. That way I won't have to rush. This also seems like the longest 00 minutes of my life. I think I am going to have chicken strips for lunch and fruit punch to drink. I am very excited about next weekend. I am going to College Station to see my best friend and we are going to go to Ag-Kickoff. PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and other bands are playing there. That will be a lot of fun and I am real excited. I went on the big ski trip last year with all of them and that was also a blast. 
__label__label0      Well I finally found the website for this place, and now PROPNAME not really sure what to say. Im sitting at my desk, and my room seems really warm. Im also very angry at my roommate PROPNAME right now. Sometimes she just isnt very considerate of other peoples feelings. I signed up for an experiment thing in my CSD class, and I have no idea where the room is! All it said was PROPNAME and the time and I have no idea what that means. I hope my teacher explains it closer to the time. Oh I also have to sign up for the experiment for this class too. I almost forgot! The ink on my hand is already wearing off, I should go write down the time on paper when Im done with this. I really like the class though, except my teacher is boring. But its cool because I want to major in communications. The lady from there never called me back! I should call her again soon. Well maybe I can get the application online or something. I wonder whats going on with the guys next door. They're always coming over here to say hi. I think Im going to ask PROPNAME if he wants to do his calculus homework with me! Hes pretty smart, and maybe he can help me. Poor PROPNAME. I can't believe hes sick now because of me! I hope hes feeling better. This chair is really nice! Yesterday was pretty scary, I get really nervous about stuff like that. The bells at the Tower were really pretty though when they were playing God Bless LOCNAME. I guess its a pretty historical moment, and Im glad I was here for that. Even though this wasnt my first choice I guess its ok. Its kind of big, but maybe I need that. Wow its been 0 minutes already. I don't know if this is due by 0 today. wait what is today. Ok I ha 0 classes so its Thursday and oh ok Sept 00. Thats tomorrow. This is crazy. I should get started on that map too. I wonder who will be analyzing this, or if it even gets analyzed. Yeah I bet it does. Why else would I be writing it. I think it said it was going to give me a printout of what I wrote and something else too. an analysis? I don't think a computer could do that. Wow tomorrow is friday already yay I get to see all my friends back home! I have to go see PROPNAME and see how LOCNAME LOCNAME is! He said hes still going to work there until the end of the year I think. I wonder what college he'll end up going to. He could get into ORGNAME, I hope he does. If not hs coming to ORGNAME so that'll be cool. Uh I can't believe this morning! Im so mad at her! I wonder when shes getting back! Should I act mad or just let it go? Its probably better if I tell her. Yeah I will. I think its bad to keep your emotions bottled up inside for a long time, or at all. Simply type continuously tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 00 minutes. I guess Im doing that. Kind of just whatever pops into my head. Oh feelings. wasnt I supposed to write about my surroundings too. I hate messing up and having to backspace! Well I still feel warm, but not as much, it was probably because I had just gotten home and had walked outside a lot. I wonder what chapter Im supposed to be on for this class. Oh man Chapter 0. Ok well I have 0 done so that shouldnt be too hard. Those notes took me forever! I need to think of a faster way. Well I could highlight like in my geography book, but I think I might want to keep my psychology book maybe for future reference or something. I hope nothing happens today! Thats just really scary, and who was it that told me that something would probably be hit today since everyone expected it yesterday. Its hard to type out all my feelings because I think faster than I type, so as soon as I think something, I start typing, but then my thoughts switch, so a lot isnt being recorded. Plus I think my mind doesnt complete thoughts all the time, so maybe Im not really recording exactly how I think. Hmm. gosh Im hungry. That breakfast was really good this morning! I thought it was going to be weird since I went down there by myself but everyone was there by theirselves. Thier Theirselves. that doesnt look right. Hey I have 00 seconds left. Uh! As soon as I finished writing that the time was already off. This is annoying. Ok well I guess Im almost done, this was pretty cool, it will be interesting to see what I actually wrote nonstop for 00minutes. 
__label__label1      right now im sitting here listening to dave matthews and my roommate is eating fritos with bean dip so i can smell the bean dip and its pretty nasty- ruffles with french onion dip is so much better but whatever- if thats what she wants to eat then thats fine with me. i think im going to go to the gym and work out tomorrow- the navy stuff hasnt been very much running or working out or anyhting so its kind of pointless to call that my workout for the week. i think maybe its because were just coming back from the summer and maybe people are out of shape and stuff or something because the navy should be a,little more hard core than its been. i think the new dave cd is kind of weird but its pretty good- the type of stuff you can listen to over and over without getting sick of it or something. this keyboard is so weird to type on- im used to my desktop keyboard and this one feels so weird because i like have to reac across it or something- i don't know what is so weird about it. i really wanted chick fil a for dinner today but it closes so early at the union- its pretty annoying- so i had to get wendy's which is good but its not what i wanted. when i was little i lived in north carolina and i used to get a number 0 with sweet tea- the sweet tea in the south is so good- and then i moved to new jersey and you can only get unsweetened tea and you have to put sugar in it and its pretty gross because then the sugar doesnt even really dissolve into the tea so you get nasty granules of it in your straw. i don't even know if you can order sweet tea down here- i havent tried but i doubt it. you have to dissolve the sugar into it before its cold because its so much better that way. now i want some sweet tea but theres no way im going to be able to find any right now so maybe ill have to figure out a way to get it for tomorrow or something. i think my cd is over now. no its not. i don't know why i always think its done right here but i always think that and its pretty annoying. oh well i guess its a nice surprise to still have a lot more left on the cd. my stereo stops after one cd instead of just going on to the next one. maybe i should figure out how to program it so it just goes to the next one. i feel like im typing really loudly and im distracting emily or something. oh well she can live. im really tired and its only like 0:00. probably because i woke up at like 0:00 this morning. this song is definitely the best on this cd. i love dave matthews- I've been to so many concerts and they were all awesome. ill have to find one down here to go to or maybe ill just wait until im back home and go to one then. that way i would be able to hang out with my friends back there. not that i wouldnt be able to hang out with them anyway. it doesnt smell like bean dip anymore- now it smells like air freshener. i wonder who thought of making up air fresheners- its so random. is this supposed to be in complete sentences and with good punctuation or anything?  i don't think so- so oh well. my knee hurts. i think i should ice it or soemthing but i don't have an ice pack. i guess ill have to get that sometime. an ice pack and sweet tea. if i wasnt typing right now i would write that down somewhere but hopefully ill remember it later. this song sucks and im thirsty now becasue i was thinking about sweet tea. you can't even order sweet tea in the north because they look at you like youre retarded and then theyre like um are you retarded and then youre like no give me iced tea and some sugar packets but im not going to be ahppy because its going tp be nasty. i could go for some pizza- liek the good stuff you can get in real pizzerias- is that how you spell pizzeria?  i guess it doesnt matter. i miss the italian food from up there so much. i can't wait to go home for christmas just because the food is so good up there. not taht the food isnt good down here- its just all mexican or tex-mex or barbeque adn who can live off of that all the time?  i need more pasta. penne ala vodka is possibly the best food ever created. i think ifigured out the problem- im too short for this desk or something. you have to be like really tall to sit here and type forever because if youre not then you start getting all pissed off because its weird to type here. or maybe its just me. i doubt it. ill have to ask emily what she thinks at the end of this thing because i swear this is just a weird position to be in. hmm. im thinking about getting some phone books to sit on or something. haha how funny would that be?  and im not even abnormally short or anything- its just weird to be here like this. im so 
__label__label0      I was thinking about college and all the stuff that comes with it. college will be so hard yet so easy, i wonder how i will control myself. i don't want the fun factor to totally overrule the work factor. but then again, the classes seem pretty fun and not so hard. yet again, it has also only been a week of classes, so i could be sorely mistaken. we will just have to see what happens as time unfolds. i'm also a little worried because i have a boyfriend that goes to stephen f. austin state university, and driving distance that is 0 and 0/0 hours away!! how will i manage this?? we have been together for over a year and a half, so i can't just throw the relationship away, he means a lot to me. what do i do?? i guess i will give it time and see what happens. college is a lot to handle, and managing it all with a long-distance boyfriend is not easy. i don't know what i'm getting myself into. i'm also really pissed that i decided to stay at dobie, because after visiting friends in towers today i realized how much better it is, and what i rip off dobie is. the food sucks!! it drives me insane how bad it is and what a rip off everything is. towers is way better. i'm just glad that i'm rooming with my great friend PROPNAME in a badass apartment next year. yay!! we'll have our own rooms and all we'll have to do is take a short bus trip to campus every day. not that bad. plus we'll be more familiar with campus and won't get so lost, as i do here constantly. but it is my first year after all, so it can't be that bad. i'm also kind of nervous about my freshman seminar class, it sounds so ridiculously hard! a lot of writing and sharing your   feelings,   and all that stuff. i had to read like 00 pages just on how to   listen   correctly to other people. i'm 00 years old! i know how to listen! this is not kindergarten. it just makes me so mad. i'm really glad i met my friend shara, i knew her slightly my senior year in high school so we come from the same background and have a lot to relate to. i've gotten to know her so well these past 0 weeks that i feel like i've known her all my life! she's such a great girl. i like how she does not hesitate to compliment her friends for ANYTHING. great character trait to have. and i'm glad about all the parties that are here in austin, and the unique culture. walking around even with a friend at night is a little scary though, but i'll never walk by myself anyway so it's all good. and i love the music scene. i'm afraid i'll go too shopping-crazy though because urban outfitters is so readily available down the street and back home in houston it was like miles away towards downtown. i'm obsessed with spongebob! i have three spongebob squarepants posters on my wall in my dorm room, and i have spongebob band-aids. he's so cute! and the show is hilarious, totally my type of humor. i have the dvd as well, is that scary or what?? and you know what makes me mad? i got a heat rash here a few days after i moved in! that sucks! why here of all places? i think houston is MUCH hotter just because of the huge humidity factor. but NO i get a heat rash here. sucks. at least it's not visible, it's only little bumps you can barely feel. AND i got a popped blood vessel in MY EYE. what more could possibly go wrong? i guess a lot but it's so much to handle right when i get there! makes me so self conscious! i guess that's a psychology topic--why people get self-conscious. interesting topic. i would like to talk about it sometime in class. i think when i'm done with this i will do some physics problems and then just watch zoolander on dvd or something. yay. i'm so glad i have a tv, vcr, and dvd player! my room is totally pimped out, how great is that. i feel so exhausted. walking isn't easy in this heat, no matter what time of the day it is. i'm actually getting really hungry. i might fix myself a peanut butter sandwich. crunchy, but of course, what else? crunchy is the way to go. should i feel guilty about making plans to go to a party on a thursday night? is that bad? i don't really think so, seeing as on fridays i have only one 0 hour class from 00-0. wow that was a lot of 0s. god i'm so hungry, is this thing over yet? my hands are shaking. need food. aagh. peanut. butter. crunchy. does it matter if i'm coherent or not? it's just that when i get hungry, WHAM it hits me like a train and i get all hungry and can't help it. oh well. i hope this thing was entertaining for you, or whoever is reading this thing. i'm glad i got this over with early. yay im done. 
__label__label0  It is a rainy  grey day and i am enjoying just hanging out around   my house. just lazing around feels good. the print on my computer   has broken. I tell you what there is always something. more money   more money. i have always worked and being unemployed feels so   strange and makes me feel like  I'm walking on a tight rope. I hate   the feeling of being cheap and worring about money. but so it goes   the money chase. I will be getting back to work very soon. Its been a   strange summer hit over and over.   It feels so good to see PROPNAME out of his brace!Man he took that whole   thing well. I think we both took it very well. Its hard to see someone   you love in pain also it can be plain hard just being around   someone who is trapped in a brace. i know it would have been a   nightmare to kick-it with me in a back brace! I would have been a   emotional rollercoaster. anyway we made it through those 0 months   pretty well. Free again,yes!   my house always seems to become a mess, I just cleaned a day   ago.  It's been along time since i just sat down and wrote. I never seem to   keep up with a journal  I only write in them when I'm sad or   depressed. What a shame i could learn so much about myself . my   grandmother says you just have to force yourself to write a 0 pages   a day. Speaking of my grandmother i need to write her she is such   an amazing women. i feel guilty because i have gotten 0 letters from   her and still have not  written. ok,ok, don't talk about it just do it! Less   talking more doing. That is so like me, I'm working on it but I love to   talk about the things I need / want to do instead of just going for it. like   working-out its silly . Ok I am just yapping about nothing and already my time is out. 
__label__label0      As of this moment, I am thinking about my boyfriend and if he truly loves me like he says. I don't think it's possible for him to love me when he gets so angry, but oh well. I notice my textbooks which are collecting dust and have these bright stickers on them. I am also noticing a blinking at the bottom of my computer, which is an instant message from my boyfriend. I wonder what he has to say. I have this funny taste in my mouth after eating ORGNAME ORGNAME food. It isn't too pleasant. My refrigerator is making lots of noise. I think it's broken. Maybe I should get it fixed. No, I'm too lazy. I'm thinking about my boyfriend again. I think he'd make a good couple with his best friend, but I don't know why I am thinking that because I love him or atleast I think I do. How do I know when I'm in love?  I ask myself this question everyday. I don't think I should be because if I was in love I would know. Love is very confusing. My boyfriend makes me really angry sometimes. I haven't had this bad of a temper ever. I think some of his temper rubbed off on me. The refrigerator is making so much noise still. I feel nauseous. I want to join a sorority, but I am not sure which one to join because I have heard bad things about the ones I am interested in. I also want to join a service one, but at the same time I want to join a social one. I think I'm just going to join this service one I heard about today and maybe join the social one next semester or next year. I miss ORGNAME ORGNAME. I used to work there with my best friend. I wish we were still good friends, but now she's weird. Sometimes I feel like she's only friends with me, so she can use me. She tends to do that. I'm worried about her though because she's madly in love, but I don't think the guy she's in love with loves her back. Well I know for a fact that he treats her bad, but then my boyfriend treats me bad. The refrigerator stopped making noise. Yay!  I'm paranoid about me not being able to spell refrigerator properly. I'm confused about the directions. Are we supposed to write until the 00 minutes are over or when we finish?  That is what I ask myself. I'm really sleepy. My eyes feel like they have big, black bags underneath them. I haven't gotten much sleep in a while. People keep staying in my dorm room and I can't kick them out because my roommate, my cousin, wants to chill with them. Sometimes I wish I could just tell people how I feel straight up but that never happens. I think it's because of my relationship with my ex-best friend. She used to get mad just because I told her the truth, so I feel like I'm scarred for life and can't ever speak my mind. Well this assignment was good. I got to speak my mind and release some stress. 
__label__label0      I'm super tired but I don't think i'll be able to sleep. I have a lot of reading to do too but I'm afraid I'll fall asleep if I crack open a book. I'm really wanting some candy right now but I already ate a huge dinner and I don't really need anything else. If you eat 0 hours before you go to bed it makes you fat so I shouldn't eat anything now. ER's on and I hate that show it's super cheesey and unreal.  Now Will and Grace is on and that's very funny. My younger brother just came out of the closet this summer so I watch it from a different view point now. He's only 00 and I'm wondering if he knows for sure that he's gay. I worry about him, I'm already super protective of him and this just makes me even paranoid about him because it's already such a crazy world out there and being in the gay community just makes it crazier. There are girls being loud outside my door, I don't really know anyone in my hall since this is my second year to live in the dorm I haven't really made any effort to meet anyone, neither has my roomate, we're justy very apathetic towards the whole dorm life now. I need to call my friends in a little bit and see what they're doing tonight anbd then decide if I should go out with them or not. I can read tomorrow during work, but that never seems to happen on Fridays. I also really need to work on my packet for spirits and figure out what project I'm going to do for it. I'm not sure if that's even really my thing. I was very involved all throughout highschool, but now I'm kindof worn out of all that stuff, and I would hate it if it turned out to be similar to a sorority because I hat ethat kind of stuff, it's so fake and i HAVeenough friends without having to pay for them. My roomate and best friend rushed this year but she didn't make it and I'm actually pretty relieved because it would have really changed her and I'd probably never have seen her anymore.  
__label__label0 Well, it's been a long day. I'm really tired but I am not very excited about going to my last class, just because right after I get out I have to rush home, change clothes, and go to work. I can think of a million other things I would much rather be doing, ya know?   But, hey, that's just life, right?  It actually feels good to be working again. I always seem to get more accomplished in school, when I have a set routine. Last year, I was just a huge mess. All I did was party, never go to class, wake up and feel like crap all day. I'm only 00, but I feel like I'm already finished with my days where I don't remember anything or have a clue as to what's going on. It makes me laugh. Anyway, so it really annoys me in the library when people have their stupid cell phones on and they start ringing and then they answer it and just start chatting in a regular tone. Or on the bus!  I don't care to hear everyone's conversations they have, but they talk like they want everyone to know what they're doing. I just thought about that because it just happened a few times in a row. But I'm not really anal about anything. I'm already thinking about what I want to do when I get off work tonight. It's the weekend, yea!!  I hope PROPNAME comes into town. I haven't talked to him in like almost 0 weeks. It's really weird. I can't even understand it myself. I'm crazy about this guy and I have been for about 0 months. He says that he thinks about me all the time too. It's just like some sort of connection I felt with him from the first time I sat down and talked to him. It's weird because we just hang out and are just like the same person. He's so funny too. But we never talk or tell each other how we feel unless we're just trashed and then we vaguely remember what we said. I'm usually not like that with guys as far as not being straight up, but right now I think it's just maybe not worth it to try to get involved because he lives in houston and I am obviously here. It's like, I know it's a mutual feeling, but I wouldn't want anything to ever mess up between us, I'd rather just wait until I know the time is right and then we can be together. Anyway enough about all that. I want to go home and hang out with my family. I love them so much. They're all just so cool. I would rather be with them than any of my friends I grew up with back home. My shoulders are so tight. It's from lugging around this heavy backpack all day. The first couple of weeks of school, I didn't even have a backpack so I hauled around this little pink ORGNAME plastic kind of hand bag with all my books. That was funny. I always had to laugh at myself, I'm laughing right now. I can just picture myself walking around campus. This cute guy just walked by. Well, I really just liked his hair. I love kind of long, messy hair with curls coming out of hats. They're so sexy. and dark eyes. I love dark eyes. They just seem to be so seductive. I have no problem whatsoever staring at anybody directly in the eyes. Sometimes I think I might even scare people. I feel like I can just see right through people. It's not because I think they're necessarily cute, or even that I want to talk to them.       
__label__label0      my roommate is gone once again. to class i believe. he's a strange sucker it   really befuddles me how he denies having whey protein and instantly changes the   subject. i wish my hands weren't so swollen it might make this easier. speaking   of psycology the professors lecture today was interesting to say the least,   especially finding out that scientists sit around shocking rats to make the ejaculate   and pass out, very strange. also strange is how someone whom i thought was   one of my most hated enemies or deemed me as such is sitting next to me in that   class . and how the girl that sat next to me comes off as much more a    city   person   than she really is.      my floor is really strange, they all just sneak around, the first week i only saw one   other person that lived up here other than my roommate who is strange himself as   previously noted, i feel compelled to change my major to pys so i can deconstruct   him and make him paranoid of the world, mostly cause of the whey protein   incident. grrr and he plays video games non fucking stop it's driving me insane,   and he's s junior. i t hought he was s freshman the way his mother was helping   move him in and such, my folks didn't even help me pack back at home, they said     see ya next weekend     we're coming down for the game'    i do'nt want to do my economics homework, so i'm doing this instead as a more   viable excuse than just sitting in front of the computer chatting and checking the   weather. leastwise i'm getting something done cause i won't be here thursday or   friday on account of me going to  a horse show in springfield ill. where i'll be   competing for 0 national championships and as i think in contention for both, so it   could potentially be a very good weekend. i'm also excited about seeing some   girl friends i haven't seen in a yr and i'm hoping they are equally excited, but we'll   see. and i hope our trainer doesn't mess the horse up before i show considering   i'll have zero practice because i show right after i fly in    speaking of flying i hope that planes will be in the air and a similar thing to last   year won't happen. we had to drive 00 hours as opposed to flying since all flights   were cancelled for an indetermined amount of time. and the show's bad timing of   starting on the 00th. and of course it's the same this yr too    i hate it when my brother's girlfriend tries to talk to me and i hate it when people   ask what i'm doing, if i'm on the computer i'm on the computer i'm not doing   anything elsewise i'd be out doing it. man coke is good, the beverage of course.   so much better than pepsi and r. c. and that ripp of stuff you get at supermarkets   that have stupid names. i hate pigeons  they really bother me   the seem so unclean  especially when you are swimmin in the pool and they are drinking and bathing in   the other side  i hate that  and those grackels they just look dirty and so annoying  but the squirrels are cool i've been tempted many a time to just grab one  but i think that wouldn't be wise especially since i don't plan on visiting the health   center any time soon, so i refrain, but it would be cool  especially to see all the out-there animal rights and weirdos faces, those people   drive me insane and all the christian rhetoric don't they have something better to   do than harrass me when i'm walking early in the morning or if i'm carrying   something the bastards set it on top, ggrrrrrr, very aggrivating, and the newspaper   what up with that if we want one we'll grab it ourselves, they'd probably get rid of   more that way because the second you call out to someone they instantly take a   defensive posture even if it is free. it's this damn culture of telemarketers and   wackos, you're constantly berrated to buy something or not buy something on   grounds that somebody else or something else will benefit, without regard to the   purchaser, but one day i hope to exploit that just like the other guy because with   the right mind set and marketing ploy people will buy anything you tell them to and   that my friend has been proved over and over again. . 
__label__label1      Hey, well, I am really very nervous, writing down all of my thoughts and feelings on this computer and not in my own personal journal. Because, atleast there I know I will be the only one reading it. But I guess I 'll start writing about what I really have on my mind. My boyfriend and best friend just took off on a long truck ride back home, which is about six and half hours away. They (PROPNAME and PROPNAME) came to visit this weekend and even though they have only been gone for an hour and fifteen minutes I miss them like crazy! PROPNAME means everything to me and I can't stand the thought of him being five hundred miles away. But then again I decided to come to LOCNAME and not to Tech. Right? Well, that is one thing that is bothering me, the other thing eating away at me is that my new step-mother, who is only four years older than me, is causing some major problems back at home. And on that note it really ticks me off that as soon as I left home she has been on a rampage and really screwing up everything. I feel really helpless because I am over here in LOCNAME and I can't help my sister or my dad go through their problems. I usually stuck up for them when I was home and now I just get to hear about them over the telephone. Which is even more bad because they may or may not be telling me the whole story. I know my dad can handle it but its my kid sister I'm worried about. PROPNAME, my step mom is such a pain. She is very very, immature for her age and I saw this coming the whole time. I just wish my dad did so he doesn't have to be going thru this right now. I really miss home. I even miss my dog, Homie. I bet he feels like I abandoned him. I was the only one who paid attention to him, but I hope PROPNAME is taking good care of him now. I've only been in school for two weeks and it feels like it should already be november. Sounds pathetic, right? I'm wondering if this was the right decision. I sure hope so. I am a firm believer that God will never give me something that I could not handle by myself. So I just have to take this with a grain of salt and leave it at that. I just wish it was as easy as that. Gosh now it has been one hour and twenty minutes since PROPNAME has left. I keep looking at the clock like he is fixing to get here instead of him being on his way back home. We have become closer ever since I moved. It seems weird saying that but I really mean it. We actually have conversations on the phone, we talk on the internet, and when we see each other it feels like it did when we first started going out, four years ago! It feels great. I love him and I can honestly say that I will marry him one day. Heck, I'd marry him tomorrow if he asked me. He is my best friend and I can tell him anything. He is smart and funny and really good looking. Better yet, he is perfect. He has never cheated on me and always makes me feel like a queen. Sometimes I'm not sure if I deserve him. But I do love him and I always will. It still feels like I'm writing in my diary, although if I was I wouldn't be as consious about typos and mispelled words! I really like this assignment though, it sure beats the chemistry homework I really should be doing right now. I hate chemistry. I hate homework! But it has to be done, right? I often wonder what would happen if I just said to heck with it all and quit. My family would freak. They are so by the book. If anyone was to go out of the norm their whole world collapse. I hope I'm not like that to my kids. I want to be different. I want to make a difference not wait for someone to do it and then say hey I helped them get there. I want to be the one to do something, something special. I just figure out what. I just know that whatever it is PROPNAME is there with me when I do it. You know what? Its hard to type when your nose is running! But I'm almost out of time so I'll keep on typing. I can do it, I can do it! Ha, ha thats kind of funny. Speaking of funny isnt if funny how when your onthe internet you mispell words on purpose and here I am trying really hard not to misspell anything, even when it doesn't matter if the words are mispelled or not. That is bizarre. Remember that song   How Bizarre   I hated it but PROPNAME always sang it and it drove me crazy. Thats funny 
__label__label1 Gone with the wind I am and away I look out into the empty space of eternity with nothing. I awake into the morning darkness hearing the buzzing noises and look at thee ORGNAME ORGNAME alarm and press snooze while i squeeze in 0 hour of extra sleep. I watch tv and walk the whole day and then i go shit in my public restroom with feces flowing from my colon down to the toilet. Oh yeah i say as I struggle. I often have a tough time. No, i don't. I don't know why I am saying that. I brush my teeth and develop anger and excitement at the same time. Anger for what i ask to me as i am me but do not know who you are. Who are you and why do you exist i say? Then i look out the window and see big yellow neon lights expressing ORGNAME ORGNAME. I take a shower with no showerhead pressure and I get pissed off! I want nice warm water and a nice showerhead. The force is strong as I see red marks become apparent on my not so hairy chest. I get the urge for herbal essence but see to see that I do not have any. Do you have the urge to say   oh yes?   I am away and out of the blue and in the light of things there is nothing. Darkness exists as a prerequisite of life. What is this   doh   PROPNAME PROPNAME says. Donuts and coffee i must have soon. Soon enough to satisfy my craving for ORGNAME pancakes and a nice morning breakfeast at a nice restaurant. I go down the elevator. Stupid ignorant people who live on the first five floors are too lazy to walk down the stairs. I had a firedrill today. How annoying the pulsating noise was. And how tiring. I could not imagine how firefighters climbed up to 00 floors on that clear, but smoggy morning on September 00, 0000. My love for skyscrapers has grown more and more. Everyday, my passion and desire to see new and taller buildings arise grows larger and larger! I wait to see what will be done with the hollowed ground-zero. Perhaps nothing will be built, but i hope for something. Tennis is a very vigorous sport. The agility and the swift hits of the nice yellow ball that i throw around to my dog with. Oh I love my dog. Nice gold fur blows in the wind as i see a slow motion love seen in the mix of progress and then he starts to hump me. Humpty dumpty sat on a wall. but then he fell off. I forgot how the riddle goes. The itsy bitsy spider climbed up to window is it? Who cares? Not me, for I am no longer in kindergarten but in college, the LOCNAME's largest college-UT! WhoohooO! I have the urge to get drunk perhaps maybe have fucking good sex. Perhaps smoke something illegal or not? My room-mate has just farted and he says sorry. I don't care. The smell is of essence. Nice allure should be made into such a fragrance and entitled El Natura. Body works in different ways. My stomach is hurting. I have been having a bloating stomach the whole day. It is like a balloon filled not with oxygen, but with helium. If i could only float in the air and swim in the sea. Fly up in the air. Perhaps the ultimate luxury would be to eat tabasco flavored cheeze-its when I am perhaps   high   in the sky. Oh yeah. good 'ol times rock on forever. Forever i must live like that. Drunken little bastard i must be during this year. Ambitions thrive to do well, but will I? Parents constantly pester me with Do well in class viju-baba. Please do well. Of course the usual response is the usual for almost everyone else.  I will,   comes out of my mouth. Deep inside i have the heart to do whatever I want, but it is the concentration that I lack. I do not like being forced to do something that I do not agree with. It is simply at its upright most stupidity. Stupid is as stupid can be but who is stupider than stupid? Everyone is judged at different levels. Ignorance is bliss honey. Bee's fly around. I have never been stung by a bee or wasp. Speaking of being stung, I like the singer PROPNAME. He is a good singer. Anyways, speaking of other things, i think things are the way that things are and that things should be left to the way that things should be. WHY? because they are things that obey other things, not stuff. Yes. I need to pee, but must I? Flaming whopper commercial's thrive in the background of my head as i feel the urge for el penetrado. Oh yeah. The music is playing and I must go now. Bye bye and bye!         
__label__label1 Here I go, frist off let me think of a topic, how about looking at a country side in the LOCNAME hill conutry. Useraly the frist thing I notce are the ceder trees, and while I like trees, there is something upsetting about ceder trees; they are not native to this part of the country, however they are well adattined to this climet. Sence ceder trees are evergeens they can feed themselfs all year round, which gives them avantivce over the trees that grow here naturaly, such as oaks and jupaters. Oaks and jupaters lost thier leaves in the fall, and both species of trees grow very slowly; aposed to ceder wich grow very fast. Thus the ceder trees have drowed out most of the oak and other native trees. This is upsetting to me because, while ceder forest is nice to look at, it is no where as impressive as an forest made up of old mujestic oaks and jupaters with there beatifull puple and white blossmues. Another thing about ceder is they grow close together and low to the ground, which makes it very hard to walk around in a ceder woolden area. Just think how great it would be to walk aroud in a forest of huge old oak trees over your head, that pervade shade, while still leting a cool wind througt. Yes, it would cerncely make the rolling hills of the hill conutry more beatuifull, and would surely enhace my beatitude, while walking through the woolds.      
__label__label0 Twenty minutes seems like an enormous amount of time. I really don't mind it though at least this assignment isn't as boring as the majority of my other homework. oh, so much homework i don't think i was prepared for such and overwhelming firt week . i thought it would be a little more like lee college. Oh, PROPNAME how i will miss your size and the personal connection i made with people there. In fact that could be one of the most significant places I've ever been. I mean after all that is where I met PROPNAME. He is so very important to me. Even more so know, being in this big city alone, I need him more than ever. That really worries me, I just thought I was beginning to not need him as much in my life and gaining a little more independance and now here I am falling back into the agonizing rut that was my sad little life for two years. I need a job, I feel badly that I've rejected offers that I've gotten, it makes me feel unappreciative of the little extra cash I could be making. It's just that i don't want to be stuck in some meaningless job that makes me miserable i can't help but want something exciting and interesting. I've been doubting my major choice lately and that is really troubling. I've never done that and it was one of the only things I thought I was sure of in my life. The doubt in that area of my future makes me want to question everything else. I need to just take a step back and calm down and try to enjoy the little things. Remember don't worry about the little stuff, and it'e all little stuff. This is a whole new life for you and an opportunity for you to find out who you are and hopefully grow to like that person. PROPNAME is a growing place for you and the chance to discover new things. This has really turned into a depressing journal entry. Mom is probably going to call again while I'm writing, and God forbide I don't pick up the phone. I really do type quite a bit faster than I used to. It is really cold in here and I need to go running. I need to work on trying to improve myself again. Iwas doing so well for a while there and then I just stopped. I guess I felt satisfied for the moment or just became frustrated with the lack of results I was seeing. I hope Dad starts working on my bike, I would really like to live closer to campus and the take my bike wherever I wanted to go. I really wish he didn't hang out with PROPNAME and PROPNAME whatever her name is. I don't want to be jealous but I can't help it. He should be jealous. I wonder if that was why I wanted PROPNAME to come and visit, for the simple reason of a childish cry for attention. Most likely, but he's not coming so I won't be giving into that anytime soon. I feel like going home but I won't be able to until the 00th. I never realized how attached i was to that comfort and safety. They were right in wanting me to stay but then again I can't help but feeling maybe I needed to be here in this town at this very period of my life. I wish PROPNAME didn't sllep so much. I don't feel sorry for her and the things that happened to her. I don't think she would have been a very strong person anyway. She needs to try harder, things aren't given to people who don't try.      
__label__label0 I just got out of rugby practice. this is the first practice we have had with the veteran players. my body hurts and for some reason I can't sleep so i decided to do this. im too excited to do anything, but think about the next practice. it reminds me of playing soccer in highschool. we should have won state my sophomore year. we had the most talented team i had ever seen at that level. two of the players from that year actually play in the mls. I love rugby. I was never a very imposing guy until about my junior year of highschool and by that time it was too late to play football. so i kept playing soccer. but i've always wanted to just level the other team, and now I can do that. I missed biology this morning because is et my alarm for 0:00 pm instead of 0:00 am. I hate when i do things like that. I miss summer school at LOCNAME. It was so much more fun than the fall. Everyone hung out together, and we could all get in to any party no matter if we were rushing or not. Now I'm lucky if I see one of the people from summer just once a week. Fall was suppose to be better. A girl that was my best friend in highschool, and I am absolutely in love with is here now. we have been here about two and a half weeks and we have only spent time together once. All she cares about is her sorority. And when we did hang out all she did was talk about how she was   tired of dealing with it.   Why doesn't she quit?  What is her obsession with being a part of something?  I just wish that we were growing closer like we thought we would in college. Instead we are moving further and further apart. Every guy she meets ends up asking her out on a date. She always some how avoids it, and I don't know why. Suddenly, a guy with plans for a very successful career seems much more attarctive than just a regular guy that wants to have fun and hang out. I can't believe i just wrote that because I am one of those guys with plans for a successful career. Maybe thats not what she is looking for at all. She lives seven floors below me but instead of coming up to say hi, she just calls. We talk two or three times a day, and when we see eachother we always give eachother subtle compliments. She is the one person who can always make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I'm in. I guess thats what being best friends for five years will do to you. I never knew I thought about her as much as I do. I think I'll go and see 
__label__label0    How I am feeling right now is interesting. I have slept so long for the past few days. I think that it could be that I just moved here from LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. Walking all over the campus is extremely exhausting and tiring. However, this weekend I did not walk a whole lot. I have just been sleeping so much. I think that it could be that I miss my mother or family and my body could be going through some sort of physical depression. That, I have no idea about. I do feel that I am getting sick. I have had a minor soar throat the past two days, and I am upset with myself because I forgot to bring my Vitamin C chewable tablets. I really like the cherry flavored ones because they taste so much better than the orange flavored ones. I know that you can only purchase the ones that I like at SunHarvest. I am not even sure if there is a SunHarvest here in LOCNAME. I do have a large gallon of orange juice, so I will just drink a whole bunch of that until I start feeling better. Or at least until I get paid so I can buy my vitamin C pills. I just got finished taking the Pretest that is required before participating in the experiments that we students must participate in before the Thanksgiving break to receive credit for this class. I thought the test was extrememly interesting. Some of the answers I were a little sketchy. In this I mean, I was unsure if the answeres I put really reflected myself or if they were merely just answers of how I want to see myself. I have a fear of aligators. That is what I meant if I had a fear of any type of animals. I have had bad dreams about aligators, but not recently. There was one that I had and then had that same dream reoccuring the months and  even years following. Yet, I haven't had dreams of aligators in a long time. I anticipate this class, for I have always found psychology an interesting subject. Well, who wouldn't. My mother never wanted me to become a psychiatrist because she said that listening to other's people's problems all the time would make a pretty girl like me ugly. I hold my mother on such a high pedistool, that I never thought of majoring in the subject again. I am a biology major. I am still unsure if that is what I really want, or if it is something that I have been trained to want since I was a child because the field was promising. I am having problems in calculus, i really don't care for the subject in the least, but it is part of my major. I feel that if I change my major just because it has a subject that I don't care for in its curriculm, that I will quit anything, for that matter, when things start getting tuff. I feel I will be a quiter. I have never felt that way about myself before and I don't intent to ever feel that way. The class does scare me. I am terrified actually. I must keep an average of a 0. 0. This may not seem to be difficult, coming from an overall average of 0. 0 ORGNAME at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, ORGNAME ORGNAME. But then I was not on a Financial Aid Plan and I knew my parents would still pay for school even if my grades fell below a 0. 0 average. So I intend to persure my dreams with my mind focused and my thoughts secured on one thing, making an A in every class. Even though I know that it will be almost impossible in Calculus II, I am going to try my hardest and I want to make my parents happy. They have given my so much already. And to make myself happy, is to make my parents happy. I don't want to be the reason of my unhappiness. If I can't make myself happy, then who really can?  
__label__label1      Wow, I remember when my english teacher made me do this. It is kind of weird having to do it now. I don't think my teacher really liked english at all. What was the deal with the random acts of kindness journal anyway?  PROPNAME PROPNAME is a great musician. I should put his CD on now to break the silence. 00 minutes?  I think I might have to piss sometime in the next 00 minutes. I guess I should have thought of that sooner. I need some   my-size   chicks in my classes. I see them around campus occasionally, but never in my classes. Actually, there may have been some in Psy. , but there were 000+ people. Damn it! I don't need to install any more MS stuff. Quit popping up that update!  I said okay yesterday hoping it would cut me a break, but it is just like the ORGNAME ORGNAME . once you donate stuff, they never give you a break. Hoo Hah!  PROPNAMEe for some PROPNAME. Man, I love the woofer on my computer!  I have the best,   phattest   bass on my computer stereo. I think my parents miss me. When I call them, it is hard to get off of the phone ever. I hope that I don't get much homework in college. I like SNL, where Tim PROPNAME did that sketch with the SportsCenter impersonation.   Right about now, the funk soul brother PROPNAME PROPNAME!  Boo Yah!  Boo Yah!  Sweet sassy molassy!    I can't wait until PROPNAME PROPNAME comes back to LOCNAME. His concert was cool. I need to keep on writing. ORGNAME ORGNAME was a sweet film. I really like the girlfriend in that movieGoddamn update reminder just froze up my computer!!!! ORGNAME is an evil empire!  They don't even give you a way to close the reminder so you just have to leave it there. Crapola!  Don't even ask me when I want to be reminded of the update. Suck it, PROPNAME!  I bet I seem kind of screwed up if anyone browses this. I love the PROPNAME song   comfortable,   even though it is a chick song. I wonder if these shoes make me look gay when I wear them with shorts?  Oh well, they are comfortable, so whoa, I just spaced out there for a few minutes. I really should go change the punctuation of the previous sentence. I have always felt like I am missing out on something by never having a girlfriend. LOCNAME kind of sucked. Maybe it is like getting a car- it is cool for a week or two, and then it loses its glamor. I wonder why no one is sunbathing on Jester beach Damn it! I don't want to update my computer! I did it yesterday!  I miss the good 'ole DOS days. Go to hell, PROPNAME!  Man, for a multi-billionaire, you would think he could get a friggin' descent haircut. It looks nice outside, with the warm sun rays blanketing the gently swaying oak limbs outside my grimy window. I wonder why people say it is a nice day outside, when it is actually better to have cloudy skies to block UV rays and keep me from having to squint. I think the people across the hall are kind of strange. Not PROPNAME and PROPNAME, but their suitemates. They have all those slutty posters on their wall and whenever I walk by they are playing computer games. Dr. Pepper is the shiznat!  Shiznat . he he he he he!  I am such a friggin' loser! Criminy!  I just lost it again for about 00-00 seconds. I only have two minutes to go now, so I think it is time for a new paragraph.  My fingers are tingling a little bit, which is pretty strange since they should be getting blood from my typing. Oh, well. Maybe I should have kept playing guitar instead of biking. Racing is fun, but you can play guitar anywhere and you don't have to worry about crashing or winning or anything like that. You just can't screw up much while playing in front of an audience. I just copied most of my writing so I can see how much I did. 
__label__label0      Ok. . i;m sitting in this computer lab of this co-op I'm supposed to like and really bond with. Unfornuately, I don't like the people very much,it smells, and the kitchen always wreeks of too much garlic (like a disgusting amount. )  Oh well. But I really like this keyboard. I think typing on a good keyboard is very important. It can really effect your typing and writing experience. It also has this great squishy thing for my wrists to sit on. All I want to do is pinch it all day. But there are other things I have to do. :)  ok. what next. well some say I'm very neurotic, but my boyfriend was supposed to call around noon and I've called 0 times already and he hasn't picked up the phone. It kind of worries me when he's that late at returning my phone calls. THEN I think about this really great hair iron I just got a week ago and how wonderful it is. It's so wierd that something could make your hair look so healthy when it is actually so damaging for your hair. Get this. it get's so hot, that i've had serious burns on my hands from just barely touching it. They don't like to sell this iron to regular consumers (I guess I know why) but I got a special hook up. Now here's where I get neurotic. I'm really scared that I DIDN'T turn off the iron this morning before I left and I wanted to tell PROPNAME to check when he wakes up. BUT what if he hasn't woken up because the whole upstairs is on fire and he's lying there unconscious or even dead?????  See what I mean?  I'm a huge worrier. Sometimes I feel that I could strech my brain so far that I could litterly make myself crazy with worry. Well, my feeling is. what if it were actually true?  you know, bad things have to happen to sombody. Why does everyone think they won't happen to THEM????  Well, technically, If I were to leave the iron on, it would probably just deconstruct itself and melt the plastic tub underneath it. But it could get hot enough to start a fire, I guess. you never know. Well now I'm getting hungry and I'm trying to decide how to spend my time before going to Psychology at 0:00. I have to put a note on this girl's door so she can help me find a replacement so I can get out of the god-awful place and then I have to check my labor assignments and then I have to check the phone book for the nearest cell phone provider so I can get a phone charger replacement. Whew!!!  quite a day. Oh, and I have to cancel an appointment with my dad because I just want to spend a few hours with my boyfriend. It that so wrong!!!!????  I saw my Dad for 0 hours yesterday and he still wants more time the following day!!!  Sometimes people just drive my crazy. 
__label__label1 My name Is PROPNAME and I am a Freshman here at LOCNAME. Moving away from home has been a difficult task. I have really been lonely here. I have noticed that it is getting easier though. I do have two brothers that live here in LOCNAME. My oldiest brother also attends ORGNAME. He is in his second year of law. My other brother PROPNAME doesn't go to school, but hopefully he will decide to one day. Classes have also been getting more difficult. I have been really stressed out because of all the reading. I am really nervous about some of the upcoming tests. Hopefully I will have prepared myself for them. I have a boyfriend named PROPNAME. It was really hard to leave back at home. I miss him very much. This coming weekend is our year anniversary. I really want to go home to see him, but I don't think I'm going to be able to. It is very difficult to be here in LOCNAME without all of my friends. When I'm bored there really isn't anyone to hang out with. My brothers are working a lot so they don't have much time to hang out. My  parents were sad to see me leave for college, my mother expecially. I am the baby of the family. My mother is extremely emotional. She often cries and gets depressed now that all of us are gone. She also calls us a lot more and e-mails me all the time. I feel sorry for her!  The only person she hangs out with is my dad. My dad isn't too bad, he just is set in his ways. He sits in his recliner and watches nascar all the time. My poor mother has to sit there and watch it with him. That really doesn't sound too fun to me. Anyway, I know that I will eventually get used to it here, but it will take some time. I just try to keep myself busy so that I don't have time to think about how homesick I am. At least I have my brothers here. I couldn't imagine being here all alone. I would drive myself crazy!  My roomate is really cool. I got really lucky with that. We have soo much in common. She has the same since of humor as I do. Also, we have all the same classes together, which is really helpful. Now it doesn't seem like I'm alone all the time. I have her there going through the same thing. Another thing is that the bus stop by my dorm takes me straight to my brother's aptartment. This makes it very convinient. I can get off campus and try to get away from it all. Well, I seemed to have come to a block. I can't think of anything to say. I'm trying to keep typing though. Oh, I really am enjoying psy. class. It is really interesting!  I know it is only going to get better too. Psychology is my major (at least for now) so this is my type of thing.           
__label__label1      My nose is really stuffy right now and I had a fever earlier today but I think it's gone now. I hate not being able to breathe. I can hear the television right now. There's a commercial about honey barbecue wings. I can also hear my room mate typing and clicking her mouse. It's really cold in my room. I'm glad I decided to put my sweater on or I would be extremely cold. I can't really smell anything because of my stuffy nose. My stomach is growling. I have a craving for pizza. Maybe I'll go get some as soon as I finish this assignment. My room mate seems to be frustrated right now. I just heard her sigh. She has a test tomorrow that she needs to study for. She is mad because we weren't able to get football tickets for the OU game in LOCNAME. I kind of wanted to go and was getting excited about going to it. The television just mentioned something about getting pizza. Now my craving for it is increasing. I can taste it now. It's hard to type for 00 minutes straight. The phone just started ringing and distracted my train of thought for a while. My room mate just left the room to go open the door. I can watch the television from where I am sitting in front of my computer. My room mate's brother just walked in. Now all I can think about is what he is saying and I can't arrange my thoughts now. I just gave my room mate's brother my graphing calculator and showed him how to use it. I can't think of what to type any more. I am quickly running out of ideas. Time is passing really slowly. Typing for 00 minutes is really hard. My room mate is still talking about the OU football tickets. She is getting rid of her wristband and now I am thinking how I need to take mine off too. What other homework do I have?  I don't feel like going to my calculus class tomorrow. It is the most boring class I have because all we do is work out problems. I should go to the discussion session today, but I would rather go shopping with my friend. I keep sniffing. I still wish I could breathe. I think that not being able to breathe is the most annoying thing in the world. I feel as though I want to chop off my nose just so I don't have to feel congested any longer. Is this feeling normal?  Wanting to chop off my nose?  Everytime I get congested I feel the exact same way. Now I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me for wanting to chop off my nose. Oh well, I bet it is a perfectly normal feeling when you are sick and frustrated. I wonder what caused me to become congested. I heard that a lot of people have been sick today. Maybe something is going around. I always get sick. I have the worst immune system. My stomach keeps growling, but I am not sure if I want to eat because I feel as though I shouldn't eat because I want to lose weight although all my friends say that I am crazy for feeling this way. They keep telling me that I am perfectly fine the way I am. I still don't believe them because they don't see what I see in the mirror everyday. I've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees. But isn't that true for a lot of people?  Don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. What isn't normal though is acting upon it. Oh well. I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial. I can't think of what to type again. I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. My room mate just laughed. I wonder why she laughed. I can hear the people out in the hallway. These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside. The refrigerator noise is really annoying. It's so loud. I feel sick still. I just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. I never get enough sleep. I always end up staying up really late and then I feel dead in the morning. My foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. I have the worst circulation in the world. Why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position I put them in. I think it has to do with the fact that I don't get the proper nutrients. My hands are starting to get tired now. I can't wait until I am finished typing. I have about 0 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 00 minutes consecutively. I wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. I bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than I can. Oh well so much for that because it's too late now to start typing faster. I could try but then it would just seem pointless. My contacts are getting dry and it's getting hard to see the screen. I hate sitting at my desk and now my arms are starting to hurt because they are in a weird position. I am almost finished now and almost time to stop. The window just appeared saying that I am finished now and I can stop typing. 
__label__label0 I'm currently thinking about what I just finished writing to Dr. PROPNAME about, my broken relationship. It was so beautiful, and the worst part is that the feeling, that beautiful feeling is still inside me. I feel it everyday: in class, before I go to bed, when I wake up. I remember the feeling of being with him, and I miss it. I miss him so much. I hate having taken him for granted. I hate the fact that things could have worked out, had I simply admitted to myself that I had fallen for a guy. That's all I needed to do. All I could do was ignore him, laugh at him, all this while trully knowing there was something else. I did all of this knowing that I meant none of it. I was fighting it! I was doing what my three older brothers had instilled in me from time of birth, All guys are the same. They're all jerks. Be careful who you fall in love with. Don't fall in love in high school, it's too soon. You have your whole life ahead of you. " I knew they were only trying to protect me, I knew they were saying this because they themselves having  been guys, knew what it is guys were after. But no, not PROPNAME! He was different. He wasn't horny or all over me, or asking me weird sex stuff. Not once did he do this. Not once did he push me into something I didn't want to do. Not once! We dated for a year, and the most he got out of it to brag to his football friends was that we held hands and we kissed each other on each other's foreheads and cheeks. This was it. And God did he do stuff for me. I hated saying I needed something or felt a certain way in front of him, because he had always go out of his way to help-ALWAYS! For Valentine's Day, he designed a shirt that said, "PROPNAME, Will You Be My Valentine?" I remember that morning, walking into the school and knowing that he was going to do something, knowing he wanted to celebrate such a special holiday with me. I hugged him, nodded, and smiled. That was all he needed. I don't know what I wouldn't do to have those feelings all over again-with him!?! I dream about laying beside him, while he has his arms wrapped around my shoulders. and just watching him breathe, watching his chest rise and lower, as he breathes. WOW! Such an amazing sight. Now, all I have are our memories, most of them of me being a 'bitch' to him, treating him so unfairly. Maybe he does deserve better than me, maybe this is all part of God's plan. But you see,  I know God knows me and he knows I have a big heart, but am just afraid to show it. He knows this. He knows how sometimes, it's hard for me to show my true feelings for fear of loss or rejection, or something or other. But what now? Should I wait? I guess so. Deep down, I have this feeling that it is not over between Hugo and I by a long shot. I know it's not over by a lot. I remember how Hugo treated his parents, better than I've ever seen  anyone treat their parents, with such respect and love. I've always had this thing that a  guy will treat his wife the way he treats his mother. His Dad also, that man is really such a good person. He really does have a lot to offer to his family, and I know Hugo too is this type of person. I only hope he knows this about himself. I only hope he knows everything he is worth. I only hope that he knows how I truly feel about him, how I've truly felt about him this entire past year. I hope he knows that behind every crude and hateful action or word,  there was an enormous amount of love just trying to get through. There was an enormous amount of love just trying to beat all the hate, and although it might have been a little late, it has been released. It has gone through all the hate. It lives in  me today, right now, right this instant as I am typing, and will live in me for a very long time, if not-eternally. 
__label__label1 Wow, the person next door has their music up too loud, but now they turned it down. I can't wait until the party tonight. I'm not normally excited about parties, my foot hurts, I moved it. Well, I'm at 00 sec. Hmm. there comes the music again. I don't like that kind of music otherwise it wouldn't bother me. What does PROPNAME's computer say?  She was playing solitaire. My wrist itched and I scratched it. Is that how you spell scratched?  It doesn't look right. It's funny how simple words often don't seem like they're spelled right. Words like of. I could think of where the o key was, there I did it again. Two minutes and 00 sec. The green light on my router box is flashing. I guess, it's supposed to, though I would think a solid light would mean it was working right. I want to know who actually reads this kind of thing, or if it is read. It might be interesting, I suppose. I bet people write some pretty crazy stuff. I almost wrote shit there, but then realized that might be inappropriate, which is funny since I just made a comment that people might write crazy things in these types of papers. Particularly if they're crazy. I make my self laugh inside sometimes. Oh goodness, I'm making jokes with myself and my stream of consciousness paper. I had to look at the top of the stream to remember how to spell consciousness. 0 minutes and 00 sec. Wow, this is going by pretty quickly. The scroll bar just started. My headphones are sitting next to my computer. I'd like to be listening to some music right now, but of course, not my neighbor's music. Maybe PROPNAME PROPNAME or Counting Crows, or Dave Matthews Band or I could get my new PROPNAME PROPNAME cd from my car. I really like every song on that cd. My dad called today. We haven't talked since I've been back here in LOCNAME. I remember last year we talked about every other night for a while. I guess we are both just more adjusted to being apart. I'm very close to my dad. Wow, I'm writing as if I'm talking to someone now, which I'm not. I should stop that. Hmmm. deep breath in and out. LOCNAME. I wish he was on-line, I'd really like him to come to the party tonight. It should be fun. PROPNAME will be there though, and he did say he might go to LOCNAME with me tomorrow. That's nice of him, but I guess, maybe he owes me because I did take him home at 0 in the morning last night (this morning). Wow, someone could find out all the crazy shit, there I said it, about someone's life by reading these writings. Writing, I haven't written in my journals in a long time. I have been writing some in the on-line diary though. so yeah. PROPNAME doesn't read it though. This is hard to not edit my thoughts. Every now and then, I think about something and then skip to something else, then realize I should be writing everything that comes into my head down. So, I am making a conscious effort not to edit, I had to look at the title of the page again to see how to spell that. I'm typically I good speller. Maybe it's the pressure of this writing assignment. 00min and 00 sec. Man, this semester, all my professors have really great websites for their classes. I'm so impressed. I wish I was good at creating web pages. Then I'd make one for myself, moved my feet situation again, and again, I'd let everyone know about my webpage and situating myself, I'd, scratched my eyebrow, I'd update my webpage every day. Scratch my ear. I don't know why I'm itching all the sudden, couldn't find the c key. Well, looked at ORGNAME's computer again. She has so many more people on her buddy list then I do. I have people on my buddy list that I don't even talk to when they're on-line. well, a number of the people on her buddy list on people from the PROPNAME PROPNAME message boards, I wanted to call them bulletin boards, but that's not what they're called. Anyway, scratching. tapping my foot. seeing that word tapping doesn't look like it's spelled correctly. Oh well. I guess this really isn't for a grade, so it doesn't matter if I spell things correctly and do our minds spell . correctly. I don't know. I'd like to be a part of the ta's studies with the tape recorder catching small glimpses into my conversations throughout the day (though I don't have fabulous conversations) or the study about people's relationships and why people stay together and why they don't. I mean, someone should do a study on PROPNAME and I,  I wouldn't necessarily call us dysfunctional, but I surely could be wrong in staying around for him for so long because yeah, he could treat me better, or pay me, scratching, more attention, scratching. I'm getting really uncomfortable, my neck and left arm is starting to cramp up, I haven't had to type this much in a long time. I guess, because I haven't had to write any kind of paper in quite some time. Well only less than 0 minutes left. This has been fun. I'm really uncomfortable. I'd like to read some other people's writings from our class. I am curious what you can tell about a person from something like this. Is is even accurate, because couldn't someone just create some elaborate/or un-elaborate story to put down here, or poetry or something. Hopefully, it doesn't sound like that's what I'm doing because I'm not. Now, I sound paranoid, oh goodness. well, nearly done. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0         
__label__label0 my knuckles are aching I'm going to pop them, lot of clicking on the keyboards in the computer lab, I keep hearing a long beep ever now and then and it is really annoying, I wish I could type better and faster and not have to use one finger, my joints are still aching I want to constantly move to pop them, my head itches and my armpits are moist and sticky, I keep having to raise my arms to keep the stickiness down and more my shirt out of my pits, my toe needs to pop and my right ring finger itches, I wonder what jenn is doing I bet she is with gus, gosh do I hate that guy he just gets on my nerves and doesn't deserve her or treat her right, but then he is cool when I'm around very annoying, it rained earlier so it was really humid after psychology, but now the air conditioning in the library is just what I need, the back of my shoe has no fabric on it so where my sock is not present my shoe rubs blisters into the flesh, another chair squeaks as some shifts their weight, a guy is talking on his phone which I always thought was a bad idea and now he is done, the weird thing about this assignment is that all I'm really thinking about is the assignment and having to think things up, I feel like it doesn't accurately establish what I'm think because I I can't type as fast as a thought comes up, my eye is burning and I feel a tear coming up its like an uncontrollable itch that I'm going to have to rub for a while, another phone goes off, its amazing how many phones there are and how everyone has their own little ring, now someone won't answer their phone and it is still going off, my knee itches, I scratch it, a zipper is undone, another person leaves the computers, and another one sits down automatically, to guys are talking and kind of annoying me, walking around with their smug looks and acting like they own it all and don't have to abide by any rules of SILENCE, that same beep again, I scratched my knee again, I wonder what I'm going to make for dinner, I'm really hungry right now but I still have my lab, stupid labs all at weird times and all out of whack, some one coughs over the loud and oddly rhythmic type emulating from about 00 computers, I shift my weight because my ass is falling asleep and cause my chair to creek as everyone takes a pause to listen look and become annoyed, more squeaking, and now my forearms are sore from resting on the edge of the table to long, I really worry about problems with my hands from typing and using a mouse and also from popping my knuckles, carri's dad has I guess a calcium deposit on his knuckle from clicking a mouse too much its pretty deformed looking, but funny, the library seems to weirdly old yet modern, a lot of the signs make me think of my elementary school and just stuff from then like the walls but its so enormous and imposing I completely stop thinking about it, I sneeze and cover my mouth but now I type so I spread my saliva everywhere I feel bad for who ever uses this next, knuckles again, some guy is looking out if the window and I want to know what he is thinking and what he is looking at, I was thinking about this one think dr. PROPNAME was talking about how we are all programmed to react to movement and sound, I guess I always knew and tried to avoid it but I don't think many people actually think about it, I think its actually pretty cool because I'm now thinking about how it is one those derived characteristics we got from our ancestors I guess who hunted or had natural predators just being able to react when ever something moved or made a noise, probably a good thing not to evolve out  of, 000 rocks evolver is a good step up for them, I notice I get really startled easily when I'm alone in my room engulfed in tv or a computer, my mom and anyone can come in and say hi and ill jump like the dickens even though it was not that big of a deal I wish jenn felt the same way it would be nice and also bad because 
__label__label1 I'm very tired right now. I know that I have not been getting the amount of sleep that I need. Is this how college is all the time?  Over this past weekend, I realized that I am beginning to get very homesick. I really miss my family, friends, and my dog. I started crying when I was on the phone with my brother earlier today. School is getting stressful, especially with band. I got a letter today saying I needed to work more on my routines. I don't know what to do. I've already put off so much, and gotten behind because of band. I practice and try to keep up with my studies. I think I really need to focus myself a little more. Sometimes I think it is the new freedom that is causing this. I know what I need to do, I just need to get motivated to do them. I also need to learn how to not procrastinate. I've been thinking a lot about PROPNAME lately, and about the church. I'm still so indecisive about what to do. Sometimes I think that I believe and sometimes I think that I'm really not sure. Now I'm thinking about death. I don't think there is anything I fear more than that, and what's sad is I know that everyone must pass through it. It terrifies me. I would never take my own life. I'm too scared of what's after, and I love my life to much. Even with all of the stress I still find things interesting. I am still proud of the things I have achieved. I have very high goals for myself and I am so excited about the future. There are so many things to look forward too. Why do people get depressed?  I've never been one to be truly unhappy. Even when there are times I said I was depressed" I never really was. It makes me sad to think that people can get so down about themselves. I was talking to PROPNAME yesterday, and reading his online journal thing. It made me want to cry. I don't see how he thinks he will never find the right person, or be successful in life. He is such a wonderful person, and has so many things going for him. Why don't people see that? Why can't they see that even with all of the bad in the world there is still good?  You know that makes me think. I am so obsessed with my life and what I do and the people I know. I think that everyone is just as worried about their life and their friends and family as I am. We all live in our own world, in our own bubble, our own space. I think that this assignment is pretty cool. I actually do this quite often. Just start writing things down. Oh man!  I just thought of what I was writing last week, about the first football game. I don't think I could ever described the rush when I marched through that tunnel. It was so crazy with over 00,000 people there in one place. watching the band march in. I had the room to myself this weekend. My roommate went out of town. It was nice. I love being with people and being with my friends, but I also really enjoy my quite time and my personal time. My roommate is really nice. I feel I've been blessed because we get along so well. I haven't met as many people as I thought I was going to meet up here. well. I guess I have met people, but I haven't made as many friends as I thought. Friendships just take time though. I really wish PROPNAME was here. I miss her. I was so glad we worked everything out before we went our separate ways. She is always been such a great friend. I respect her so much. I don't know what I would do with myself if it had been my mom. That is another one of my big fears. losing a loved one. When PROPNAME's mom died so suddenly a couple of years ago we were all so shocked. I don't think there was one of us that didn't give our own Mom's huge hugs the day we found out. I was so upset, and PROPNAME had me call everyone and tell them. That was so hard. So many people thought it was a cruel joke. Why do people do that?  Go into denial. I guess I would have if somebody had called me and told me that. That was two years ago. Time flies so fast. It doesn't even seem like two years. Only like yesterday. Sometimes I wish we could just freeze time. During those special moments or the happiest time. just make time stop. even if it just added and extra minute, I think it would be nice. Oh look, my time is almost up. 
__label__label1 okay so I'm sitting here in the computer lab in simkins dormitory     hall, realizing that I cannot type very well. how embarrassing to keep     deleting. it is so hot in here and I hate macintosh comps. I wish I     had a laptop in my room. I wish I had money. my roommate brought a     computer, and a tv. I feel like the poor one in the room. I actually     decided to do this assignment now because my roommate has two     guests over right now. they are two very nice girls but I just wanted to     get away. I just barely got back from houston at about 00 and I need     some alone time. what a weekend I had. my friends tiffany, and     diana and I went to these auditions saturday for a winter guard called     emblem000. a very renounced performance group. anyway, it is a very     fun group a kids and I was really excited about the audition. I first     and foremost am a dancer. since the audition consisted of dancing     and flag work I excelled in the dance portion. my flag work was not bad     either. don't you hate when you want something and everybody says,     oh you're going to make it". and then you don't? that's right, tiffany and     diana made it and not me. it is because I don't spin rifle and I know     the instructor wanted a male rifle line. it is pretty sad. I really wanted     to be in this group that just has so much fun together. but what     really hurt the most is the fact that I feel I fail at everything I go for in     life. let's start at the beginning of my senior year in high school. I     tried out for drum major and was told I'd make it no questions asked. I made it to area auditions on my french horn and was told I'd make     the all-state band no questions asked. I wanted to be section leader     for marching season and ended up not as the president but the vice. came to college didn't make the ballet class for my major, don't have     a spot on the field for the band's chicago show this coming game,     and didn't make it into emblem. wow. I feel a lot better. it just sucks to     be me right now. but I always pull through with God's help. or do I     just get over it? my hair is starting to itch. I think I should shower     tonite instead of tomorrow morning. I wonder why do we itch. what is     the explanation of an itch. are the nerves freaking out and by     scratching does that friction calm the nerves back down? I think     about the reason things happen often. like why do our joints make     the cracking sound? something about the releasing of air or     something. I forget. I must go to sleep soon. I have to get up for     dance class at 0. yeah tell me about it. my mom bought me all these     groceries so I don't have to worry about walking across campus to     eat all the time. I love her so much. even though money is tight, she     always makes a way for me. I will never forget the strings we had to     pull for my high school prom. okay time has expired. this little     assignment makes me feel I should get a journal. I just hope I have     done this right. Ii aiming for an 'a' in the class!        
__label__label0 I am in my dorm lost in my own thoughts. My roommate went to LOCNAME so I am left here to do homework and what ever else I decide to do to take up time. the TV is blaring, however, I hardly ever watch it. The people next door are playing their music and I hear some bustling in the hallway. the air conditioning is making this high pitched squeaking noise. Somebody just got off the elevator. My stomach is growling, I have been up for several hours and haven't eaten. I love my computer. I feel sorry for people who do not have a computer in their room. almost all of the classes ise the Internet so it has to be difficult to do much work. I have a really short attention span. That is why I can't watch TV Every thing I see reminds me of something else and I start to not watch the TV. I like it here(UT). I thought that I wouldn't like such a big school because my high school was so small, however, I found that I do like it. It is good to have a change. Some people think that change is not good but I think even the best things need a change every now and then. I have to use the restroom. the light in our bathroom flickers every time you turn it on. It doesn't bother me I'm just glad that my roommate and I have a bathroom to ourselves. I don't know if I would have been able to deal with someone who does not keep their bathroom clean. Dishes in the sink are kind of like that for me too. If there are any in the sink I always do them. I guess you could say that it's a pet peve. Burger King ad is on the TV that sounds good. This computer light is giving me a headache. For the past couple of years my eyes have been giving me a headache. Certain lights hurt my eyes. It is a miracle if I go a day without my head hurting. I like to drive standard cars. I really makes me angry when people buy a sports car that is automatic. It would be so much more fun if it was manual. I am the worlds worst speller. and I think I have dyslexia. I confuse my left and right especially when I'm driving. It's not that I don't know the difference I know which way to go I just say the wrong one. Really I'm just a hypochondriac. My best friend came to visit me this weekend. I had a blast. Now I have to go visit her. She lives in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. Never heard of it, well no one has it's just below PROPNAME. basketball is now on TV. I don't know who is playing. My cell phone just rang. Too bad they are just going to have to wait I'm in the middle of something. I wonder who it was. oh no my twenty minuets is up. It was nice talking to you. Bye. 
__label__label1 I'm just sitting here typing. Mu light is pretty bright. I got it at office max. I got it with my mom the last night she was here in LOCNAME before she went home. We had gone to target earlier that night and I saw one of my friend's car parked outside. It was weird because he is going to LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. My psychology book says PROPNAME on it and I am assuming that that is one of the writers of the book. There's a picture of my sister and me on my book case. We went to LOCNAME last summer. It was fun. We stayed on a tiny little island with my entire family . There is a little PROPNAME guy sitting next to the picture looking at me. He is not actually looking at me because he doesn't have eyes, but his carved out eyes are pointed in my direction. My grandparents gave it to me. They are pretty cool. My grandfather was in the navy. I've been to LOCNAME many times and I always go to my mom's uncle's house and play with all my little cousins. Those are some fun times. I'm taking Management Information Systems 000 with PROPNAME. She seems pretty cool. The book is red and has a little blue box on the side that says ORGNAME ORGNAME. Come to think of it, I think my econ book is also published by ORGNAME ORGNAME. I was listening to a song earlier by a band called Outlandish. Good song. There's a sticky note underneath my lamp. My mom gave me this biscotti tub. I don't know why, but she did. I keep mints in it. I have a pack of green gum sitting next to me. It's doblement, the good kind. I'm already tired of writing and I'm only 0 and a half minutes in to this. I still have mono so that could be attributing to my tiredness. I have had it since late February, early March. It's a pain in the butt. I was fine for a while, but right before school started, I could feel it coming back. It's weird how I can feel it coming back. My roommate had to go to some scholarship dinner. I don't know when he will be back, but he is pretty cool. My computer speakers were made by Harmon/kardon. I had never heard of them before. Maybe I had, but they aren't a big named company yet. This could be their way of promoting their product. By striking a deal with HP. My monitor is big. It's a 00 inch Flat Panel. It's nice on my eyes. I used to sometimes wear contacts. I hate those things. They make my eyes all messed up. By the end of the day, my eyes hurt so bad, I can't even stand to keep them open. So I decided to go with glasses. I wear them at night and when I'm in class sometimes. I can see alright without them, but there is some things that I really need them for. My spanish teacher is kind of weird. I wasn't sure what I thought of him at first. But he seems like an alright guy. I saw him at the gym the other day. I need to work out more. But sometimes I'm just too tired or not in the mood or just don't want to go. My ex-girlfriend used to encourage me to go. I actually started going for her. But then gave it up when I got mono. I used to go to the athletic club. I remember walking in from the cold december days after school. It was still cold in january and february. I love the feel after working out. When my whole body feels numb. I don't know what causes it, but it feels good. It's even better when you work out inside and then go outside where it's really cold. I love that feeling too. But yeah, I went running the other day and got that numb feeling when I was done. My dad runs a lot. He is super cool. He went to LOCNAME LOCNAME and all that and still he is a lot of fun. He is serious when serious stuff needs to be done, but all the other times he is cool. My mom does a lot for me too. She helped me move in and whatnot after my dad had to go back. I haven't eaten candy since I have been here. I have decided that candy is one thing that I don't need. I've been trying to eat better and I think I've been doing a good job. I take vitamins every morning and try to eat something too. I have never eaten breakfast and I regret not doing so. I have started trying to eat breakfast but it's just not appealing to me. Oh well. My ceiling has all these little bumps in it. My mom painted my sisters room and used a sponge thing and made the walls kind of bumpy. It is cool. It reminds me of a sky kind of. I went to the football game on Sunday. That was awesome. Quite the blow out. It rained a lot of the game, but it was still fun. It was my first UT football game. My sister goes to ORGNAME and I went to one of her games, but they have no school spirit. Here, everyone gets involved and that's what makes it so much fun. I went down to the box office to get a football ticket for a friend, but they said that I probably wouldn't be able to get one because they were almost all sold out and I would have to wait until Friday to even try. It should be a good game though. We are playing LOCNAME at 00 am. Early game compared to last weekends 0pm game. Last game I went in to the wrong gate and had to walk all the way around to find my seat. 
__label__label1 Well this weekend has been really different. I guess that's because it was the first" actual weekend that my friends and I actually went out and "explored" LOCNAME. I know that we have been here for two weeks already and haven't "explored" PROPNAME, but I think it was better this way. The first weekend we didn't want to go home and deal with all the emotional issues that we had dealt with just two weeks ago. It was also weird this weekend because not one ORGNAME our friends was with us. She had in a way "made new" friends, which is alright with me and everything it is just that she was trusting them as soon as she heard that they wanted to go and party in Austin. What was really scary was that last night my friend went out with these girls that she has only know for a week and they went drinking at some party. I don't mind the drinking issue or her not hanging out with her old friends from high school, it's just that she was leaving Austin (the party was in LOCNAME LOCNAME) and the driver said she wasn't going to drink a lot. I was kind ORGNAME in awe that my friend left with people when the designated driver was even drinking. I feel that even if the designated driver has at least one drink than that person shouldn't drive. I guess that's what this whole college experience is all about. People are responsible for making their own decisions here. No one is here to tell them what to do and no one should. These people are adults now and can think for themselves. I also know that another reason I didn't want to or even want to go home until I really have to is to deal with the emotional issues ORGNAME leaving my family, especially my mom. I know that I'm close to my father and my younger sister, but it seems that every time I talk to her on the phone or when she came to visit last Thursday, I felt like I needed to cry. I don't know why I felt like that. I know that we're very close but I really don't want to deal with that issue of me not being able to let go of my childhood and become that adult that my parents have tried to raise me to be. I also have another worry on my mind. One of my guy friends had be accepted to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME and he was rooming with my best friend's boyfriend and according to them, everything was great. My guy friend had been dating this girl for the past four months now and she had helped him move in and settle. And this past summer they had spent, from they told my friends and I, nearly every day together. Or if they weren't together, they at least had talked to each other one the phone for a couple of hours. To me that sounds kind of like they couldn't leave each other alone or trust each other but I don't know if that would be normal because I haven't really been in a relationship like that. Well to continue with my worry, according to my best friend's boyfriend, our guy friend had been kind of sad about missing his girlfriend (she is going to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME). Every time his girlfriend would call him, he would get sad. And my best friendn's boyfriend would try and get him out of the room and go around the campus, and he would be happy, however as soon as she called, he would get sad again. And of course we all understood that him missing her was normal. Well the ORGNAME of ORGNAME started two days before we did and that Monday night our friend had been talking to his girlfriend and was mad because he had missed her. Well apparently she gave him her credit card number and he took a plane flight to LOCNAME. And he told my best friend's that he was never coming back. What we don't understand is why he decided that. This is his first relationship and they already have given each other "a promise ring" or a "promise gift" because she gave him a realy expensive watch with a diamond in it and he gave her the ring. What my friends and I don't understand is what is going on through his head. Well my time is almost up. I have like ten seconds left so I guess that's it. 
__label__label1 This is different, I always thought stream of consciousness was a writing style, I never knew it had a basis in psychology. Should I used punctuation, I don't think my thoughts are punctuated. These must be horribly boring to read, the most eclectic thought process and there is that annoying girl with loud voice. And my girlfriend wants to read these, but I don't want her to, she didn't listen to me, how rude. She never listens, just constantly does what she wants, and complains. If she reads this now, she will be understandably upset. We moved down to LOCNAME together from ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME and its been more stressful than I had imagined. I was the impetus behind our transfer and feel some guilt whenever she doesn't enjoy something, and constantly want her to have a great time, even though I share some of her misgivings. Although I have to say the campus is great, the school is good, and I enjoy going to class; however, ORGNAME did not match up to my expectations. Its a tier one school and I expected more, I can detect little difference between here and Northeastern, except Northeastern has more money. Do we compare our writings at the end of the year and look at how are thoughts have changed as we have become more integrated into the school?  I hope not, I hope there is some more interesting point to this class. Or maybe, this class will give me a greater ability to analyze the writing which will lead to a deeper understanding of my self. My girlfriend is so stubborn she takes so long to come to the obvious conclusions. She can't study because of the loud girl with the annoying voice and I told her to go to the library and I would join her in twenty minutes, but no, she would rather suffer. Maybe she knows I feel guilty when she does not enjoy something and wants to punish me in some way, or maybe she just wants to be near me. Or maybe she is afraid of change. I heard yawns signal the body is preparing for a change in action or state of being, maybe that is accurate, never heard that before and it doesn't occur in all situations. I did an internship at Northeastern and I hated it, that made me focus a lot more on school. I was always disorganized and rarely put effort into school, after that experience however, I want to get the best grades I can and the widest range of academic experience. I feel that the more ways I learn of analyzing a situation, the more thought processes, the better I will be able to deal with the real world  and whatever I want to do. Mostly right now I want to be a trader, a hedge fund manager, be wealthy. Predominately to have security and independence. Not have to worry about work and do whatever I enjoy. I think that would be economics, write essays on economics, and that ties in with trading and hedge funds, so it is not far. I also am interested in politics and think about running for congress. This paper clearly alters my thought process, I don't lay myself out every time I think, it has an artificial quality to it. Although, in class you said one way to deal with depression and change was to right about it, maybe this homework assignment is a self-help exercise. How come women care more about the personal life and thoughts of other people than men, in general, not every woman. I assume that someone else wants privacy and to be treated with respect but women always want to know what is going on and pry into it. People are interesting to watch though, but there is a lot of commonality in all human actions. People tend to do similar activities, not exact activities, but similar. Groups of people tend to act in similar fashions. That loud girl left, its so much quieter here. I don't know when I am going to graduate, but Ill have 00 credits after this term, and six months of an internship experience, crazy. At some point I need to graduate, that'll be exciting but nerve racking. I'm mostly worried about paying bills and saving for retirement and college for children. Its insane I worry about that, I'm 00, not 00. But being interested in finance makes me think about that now, and how important the first few years in and after college are. Since money in the stock market will double roughly every 0. 0 years on average, its important to start early for retirement. What about all the people in less developed countries, specifically third-world countries. We should do more to help them, humanity only has itself to support it, we shouldn't exploit each other. I wonder what the world would be like if people were able to look beyond the immediate future and into the next 00-00 years. They would see its in their best interest to help those less fortunate. Ending slavery and instituting a minimum wage has caused real wealth to increase, not decrease and society is more stable. Imagine how much better the world would be if everyone had a stable society, could go to college, contribute to humanity and become consumers. There would be more technological advancements, real wealth would increase faster, I'm sure we would find new problems, but things would be better. I'm not sure multilateralism is the answer, institutions do impinge upon our sovereignty, but they are better than a single hegemonic power trying to control the world. There aren't any attractive girls in here, besides my girlfriend. I wonder what that says about the business school atrium at 0 o'clock on a wednesday. Not a happening spot perhaps?  Although there a ton of people here for the cash flow casino. 00 minutes, sweet, I can do other homework. See you Friday. 
__label__label0 ok, so I am supposed to write about what I am feeling, hearing and thinking. all that, so, the trucks outside my window are driving around backwards for some strange reason and the beeping is really a pain. It starts at 0:00 or 0:00 in the morning and the beeping goes on all day long. My roommate wants to know how much work those trucks can actually accomplish when they are driving backwards!  lol, I agree and would really like to know, all I see when I look out my window is a big whole in the ground, not to much progress. but I am sure the construction will be moving along slowly but surely. Oy veh, I have not typed in such a long time, I have gotten so slow. I am just like my grandma, new technology drives me nuts. My computer, phone, everything, too confusing!  I like having no alarm clock or phones or computers or anything, but its all just part of america I guess, so along the lines of beeping, the door to my floor is beeping again, the alarm has gone off every time someone goes in or out of the door. It's all part of dorm life I guess, luckily I can sleep through anything so it doesn't really bother me much, just when I am trying to study but that is why we have libraries. I am a little worried though that I won't wake up is there is a fire drill or something. My roommate (I wonder how you spell that - room mate?  roommate? or roommate?) anyhow, she will wake me up. thank goodness. my suitemates just made dinner even though its late and it smells YUMMY!  I think it's pork though so I'll have to miss out on this one. It's amazing the things you can cook in the microwave these days. EZmac seems a little scary but most food turns out pretty good. I really miss my moms cooking, I think that is got to be one of the hardest parts of being away from home, the food and the fact that me family would always eat together. It's so quiet here I can tell the weekend is winding down. Friday and Saturday nights are so noisy and something is always happening. Now its all hush hush. I've only been typing for nine minutes and I can't believe how much random stuff I have thought of. I took a Yoga class today with a friend, I had never taken one before and somehow you move around for like an hour and come out of the class feeling like you just took a great nap for the whole time. The instructor played this awesome music (the only word I can think of to try to describe it is zen"), it was happy and sad at the  same time. Very interesting. I have taken up going to the gym because it is about the only past time that lets me avoid my school work and procrastinate without feeling too guilty. It's a great excuse, so to the gym I go. It's fun though, I made friends with all the crickets that live in and around the pool. I have never seen such big crickets before in my life, only in LOCNAME and stuff like that, they are huge here, it's like they are on steroids or something. Bugs are not my favorite but I guess they can enjoy swimming too. I want some popcorn, ya know, like the really good but really bad for you movie theater popcorn. How come everytime someone pops a bag, it seems like everyone in the world can smell it!  yum!  so, my walls are covered in post-its, I always need a reminder for something and my room is finally starting to look a bit "lived-in", the walls are so bare and the rooms are so boring. I like things bright and busy busy busy!  My roommates favorite color is pink and her whole side of the room is light pink, which just happens to be my least favorite color, I think that may have something to do with me never wanting to hang out in my room, it's really awful. She is awesome and we get along perfectly except for out choice of color so I really am lucky. But anyhow, it's amazing how a color can affect your mood so much (or at least mine). I really wish I could type faster. Mas rapido!  I haven't used my computer hardly at all, I got used to living without technology this summer and I loved it. People here rush all the time, we need to learn how to take it easy and just enjoy everything that is around us. We are so silly even though we pride ourselves with being so advanced, I think we just get caught up in it all and forget how to take a break and chill. I am tired of thinking, I have been doing it all day, I wish I had a switch to just turn my brain off for a few minutes. My roommate just walked in, she opened the door and I jumped, now she is looking for her key, what a bummer to lose. That or an I'D, your I'D is like your life here, ok, well, my time is running out, hope you enjoyed reading what all was floating around in my head!  wow, done at exactly the right time. woo hoo!   
__label__label1 Well, here I am writing my paper for psychology. There is so much noise here. Everyone has their stereos on full blast. It's a good thing I have mine. I need to change the song. So many songs that I skipped. It is okay. I found one that I want to listen to. This is a really good song. It is called PROPNAME" from A Perfect Circle. Their new album was strange. It sounded like a different band, so calm and mellow. I like it anyways because it calms me down. I don't know what I would do with out music. It is so essential to me. I believe that it is my sanity. If I didn't have my music I would go insane. So many feelings and thoughts in the lyrics. I am amazed that someone is willing to reflect on their lives or any given moment and come up with such inspiring. I can't think of the other word I was going to say. I hope I do well in my classes. I am really getting used to this thing called "college life. "  I feel at home and myself here in LOCNAME. I've been waiting for a day like this. I still miss my family though, but I am strong. There goes two minutes off my time. My mom called and I had to explain to her something. I sometimes feel confused about who I really am. There are always moments in my life where I take a moment to reflect on myself and existence. I wonder how we did come about existing. So many explanations and theories, it is hard to believe them. I would rather come up with my own explanation. It is hard to, but I still have until the day I die to come up with an answer. I can't believe that two years have past since my uncle died. I will never forget that day. I really never experienced a death in the family. It really changed my outlook on life. I know wherever he is, he is looking over me and seeing how much I have accomplished. So many obstacles in my life and I managed to knock them over to get where I wanted to go. I wonder where I am going to end up in life. This journey is long and treturous. I need to tread with caution. So many threats in the world now a days. What drives the human race to act the way they do. So ignorant and destructive. As long as I just focus on my life and not that of others, I will be fine. It has got me this far. Life is so wondrous and worth living. Twenty one. the beginning of our end. 
__label__label1 I was just typing for like 0 minutes and all the stuff I just typed erased. So now I'm really pissed off. I was writing about my boyfriend and how I miss him and he just called and said he was going to call me back. I am so excited about this weekend cause all my friends in school will be down this weekend and we are going to go out and spend time together. I am so excited. I really don't like it up here I just have to deal with it and get used to it. I get so happy when I get to go home on the weekends. So you could say I am living for the weekends. That is bad I guess but I don't know, I just have to get used to it. I am talking to my friend right now. She is a good friend but sometimes she gets on my nerves cause she can be so fake sometimes. I wish she would just be herself all the time. I wish that some of my friends would come up here. I am ready to go home. I miss my family and especially my mother. She would comfort me right now. I need to read my bible. I am so bored right now. And I'm tired because I stayed up late last night to finish calculus and chemistry. I wish the professors would get together so that we wouldn't have so much homework. I am so bored. My friend is on the phone and she is talking to me lying again. I hate when she lies. She does that all the time. I wish she wouldn't do that. I wish my friend PROPNAME would come up here and go to college with me. I have already made up my mind that if I don't like it by the end of the semester I am going to transfer. I will try to stick it out though. I have calculus homework due Thursday and I am going to have to get my cousin to come help me cause some of the problems I don't know how to do. My calculus teacher moves too fast and even he doesn't know what he did on some days. That is horrible. I can't wait till I get in my major because then my classes will be smaller and I will be able to understand stuff better. Dang!  I didn't know that twenty minutes lasts this long. I have like nine more minutes. I am so bored. As soon as I finish this I am going to sleep. No!  After I talk to my boyfriend. He is coming up here on the 00th and I can't wait. I haven't seen him in a while. I wonder what he is doing right now. My daddy gets on my nerves. He always has something smart to say. He can't never just let stuff be. I wish he wouldn't call sometime if all he is going to talk about is stupid stuff. I am really glad I have church members that care about me. I have received so many phone calls. It really encourages me to know that I have people praying for me. I have to keep reminding myself that I want to be a pharmacist and that I have to do what I have to do to get it. I am so wishing that my six years here would be fast and I will do good and that I won't fail any classes. I want to talk to my boyfriend now, but I am not going to call him until I finish this. Twenty minutes is long, and I didn't know it could be so long. I guess that is when you are wanting time to pass because If I didn't want time to pass it would be going by fast. I really miss my mother. I'm about to read my bible, so I can gain some encouragement. I think I may call my mother before I go to bed or not. I need to quit acting like a baby and start being the grown up that I am and accept my responsibility. I am about  to call my boyfriend. I love him and hope we get married right after I finish school, if we last that long. If not, I wish the best for him in life. But I think we would be good together. We are good together now. Except when we get mad at each other and then we are still good together. I can't wait till wee see him this weekend too. And my family. I'm ready to see everyone. I love being at home. I wish when I was in high school I didn't always want to leave home 
__label__label0 Wow 00 minutes of typing, that is cool. Man I lki this song. I wonder what other home work I have to do. ohh well this is cool, to bad I have already done this before. I liked my high school psychology class, it was fun. I wonder how I am going to do in this class. man it has only been two minutes. I don't know what my roommates infatuation with this 00 show. whatever floats his boat. wow running out of things to think about. man that rat, ejaculation thing that the doc talked about today was great, I was really intrigued.

I'm going to be dead. 00 seconds, man this was just enough 00 seconds, done! 
__label__label1 Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness     paper. I still haven't really figured out yet what I will write about, but I suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. That's good I guess,     right. Sure. It's cold in the computer lab here. It's always cold in this lab. And it's     always cold in the library. In most places throughout the ORGNAME, in fact, it is     cold. It is especially cold in the student union. I mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 00 degrees in there. There is one place, however, that I have found is     not cold - it is hot. My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. And it doesn't really help that it is still like 00 degrees outside. One thing I     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. This is very good     news. Hopefully it will continue to get cooler. So looking at the timer at the top of     this page, I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic, nor have I     even begun to write on a topic. It's just meaningless facts from my mind. I'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean. There must be some     point for this. Hopefully at least. So far my classes have been pretty good. I don't     have a huge workload yet. I assume that it will pick up eventually. Especially next     semester. From ORGNAME's experience, I have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. Actually, I am quite certain that it will be rough. I     will be taking differential equations -- which PROPNAME said was hard --  and     physics, which I know will be hard. Oh well, I can handle it. I am enjoying school,     though. It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in     my life. All the freedom and extra time. I just like the atmosphere that is college. It's fun and different. Well only five minutes have gone by so far. I'm still a little     hungry. I should have had more lunch. Oh well. I only have one more class, and     it starts in 00 minutes and is only an hour. That's not too bad. I am writing on a     Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that ORGNAME Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if ORGNAME put out programs on ORGNAME's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 0 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach PROPNAME. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     PROPNAME -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with PROPNAME again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. I am used to a program fixing it all for     me. Oh well I suppose it's good for me. But this sticky keyboard is not. Geez!  If     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. And they crazy IMer is still typing away to     like 00 of his closest friends. It's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (0 minutes left)  One good thing I will say is that     Macintosh's do look pretty cool. I like the whole clear theme. I also like the     widescreen. It's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. I think the clock on the     computer is slow. After 00 real" seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 0 seconds. So for every "real" minute, 00 seconds go by. So in a 00 minute writing sample, I     must actually write for about 00 minutes. See I thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. I thought that my watch said 00:00 when I started, and now it is     00:00 and I still have 0 minutes to write. Maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. That's crazy. I have a one o'clock     class. I hope that my "0" minutes doesn't last too much longer. Well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. I have to say that     I have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. I     don't know that I like it that much either. I have noticed that when I type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. So I have been writing for a     loooong time. Ok, my time is up. Bye. 
__label__label0 I am sitting in front of my computer in a small Jester dormitory. I look around and I notice that the room is a complete mess. I take a deep breath and I can smell something funny. That's right, that's how Jester rooms always smell like. I am feeling pretty full right now after a eating a delicious sandwich from the Jester City Limits. The room is nice and cold, unlike the hot and humid weather outside. My roommate is out of the room right now, so it's a little quieter than usually. I am playing some music on my computer right now. Besides the music coming out of the speakers of my computer, I can hear occasional chatter and doors opening and closing in the hallways. My roommate walks in after eating at Jester City Limits. I say hi to him and how his dinner was. He notices something weird as I read out what I am typing. He asks, What the crap are you doing?"  I respond by telling him that this is for my psychology class. I turn my attention away and try to think of what to write next. I am sitting upright in an uncomfortable wooden chair that came furnished with the room. I uncross my legs because my left leg is starting to feel numb. I hear someone using the blow-dryer in the bathroom, which is right outside of my room. I look up at my bookshelf and see all my textbooks. That reminds me that I have lots of other homework to do when I finish with this assignment. I have a strange anxious feeling because I am a little behind in all my classes, especially with reading the textbooks. I think about how I have missed three morning classes already, a quiz in one of those classes, and I get an awful, guilt-like feeling because I don't want to do badly in my classes. Maybe I should go to sleep earlier tonight, for that matter, every night. I notice my computer's processor making slight noises as I am typing. I take off my glasses because I only need them to read. I look back up at the bookshelf and remind myself how much work I still have left to do. I notice that I have been shaking my right leg. Maybe I have been doing this the whole time?  Some sort of a nervous habit I guess. I feel a little pain on the surface of my knee. I reach down and touch the band-aid covering a wound that I suffered from playing soccer at LOCNAME last night. And the twenty minutes is up. A pop up says that I can keep on writing with my stream of consciousness. Does that mean that I should just finish with my train of thought, or should I keep writing more and more?  Maybe that would help me get a better grade on this assignment. Ok, I am going to just stop and press the "Finish" button. 
__label__label0 Right now, I'm a little confused. I'm not sure how one goes about tracking their feelings, or even focuses on them long enough while typing. I'm wondering if anyone is really going to read this. While I'm a little frustrated with the assignment, I think I would much prefer to be the one typing than whoever the poor soul is that has to read 000 some odd of these things for whatever purpose. OK. My arm itches. Now I feel stupid for typing that. I'm a little tired. It's almost 0 at night and I've been at school all day. 00 and a half minutes. I'm sitting in the UGL. I like their computers because they are much faster than mine at home. I only have dial up. Also, I like the library computer lab because I like to listen to all the clicking of the keys on the keyboards by the other people in the room. Now I'm a little self conscious that I may be hitting the keys too loud. I'm typing much quieter now. 00 and a half more minutes. I'm in a chair that rotates and rocks. I like chairs like that because I can move around. I can't sit still too long. I'm a fast mover. Even in class I'm constantly rocking, or fidgeting, or drumming with my fingers. I'm getting tense. I'm anxious for the 00 minutes to be up. 00 and a half minutes. I'm running out of things to say. This is very much like a one sided conversation. OK. I'm stumped. I'm sitting here racking my brain, but in doing so I think I'm violating the purpose of this assignment as being random. 00 more minutes to go. My arm itches again. Ha ha. I have my cell phone next to the keyboard. My girlfriend got it for me, but I hate it. It gets horrible range, and the ring is weak. It rings like an old feminine man. I'm ashamed to carry it around. My girlfriend insists, though, so I do. It's the path of least resistance. I'm better at arguing than she is, but she can argue longer, and in the end, it's her endurance that wins out. I'm swinging in my chair. I seriously hope no one has to read this. I hope this is some study about how long 00-00 year old males typically type in 00 minutes or something. My sincere condolences to whomever has the misfortune of pouring over each one of these with the intent to interpret some psychological insights. 0 more minutes. I'm perking up a little bit. I can see the proverbial finish line. I'm swinging in my chair again, but my arm stopped itching. Yeah!  0 minutes. OK. Now, I'll admit. I'm stalling. I'm holding out for 0 minutes. This is like watching water boil. What I'm feeling?  I've never been so anxious all day as I am right now. 0 minute. I'm stumped. 00 seconds. Bye! 
__label__label1 Well I am sitting at my desk. It's kinda dark in here so I just turned on the lamp. I have a lot of homework to finish, most of it for the psych class. My homework has not been too bad so far. Just a lot of reading. I am ready to go home and see my cat, I really miss him more than other things that I should probably miss more. My mom would get mad if she heard me say that, but sadly it is true. Well my mind is a blank, I can't really think of anything to say I know we are supposed to just type whatever comes to mind, but my mind goes completely blank whenever I try to write anything, no matter what it is. I guess that is why I never could keep a journal or anything like that. I would start out the first day writing some, then it just tapered off until I stopped writing completely. I have several journals with only the first couple of pages written on. Wow 00 minutes is a long time, its only been 0 since I started. I'm trying to keep writing for the entire duration, but it is weird how when you are supposed to write freely your mind won't cooperate. I guess that is what you are trying to figure out. It is ironic how the mind works, that is why I have always wanted to take a psychology class, so I could better understand its inner workings. I am frustrated that I really cannot think of a single thing however. I miss my best friend, Faith. She is at LOCNAME (spelling?) in LOCNAME. It is about 0 hours from here. I am thinking about going and visiting her over spring break, but that is a little hard without a car. I will probably have to fly home first and get my car from there. Surprisingly my parents are not going to sell it (like they originally planned) and are keeping it at home (where it is currently getting no use). I guess it was their last attempt to get me to come home some of the time. I am only going home once before the holidays. That's only for my high school's homecoming. Which I am kind of excited about. I know a few of my good friends that are also coming home for the game, so I will get to see them. That is the only weird thing about college. You realize how much your friends meant to you. It is odd not seeing them during class like you are used to. But, luckily I have met a few great people, and we have become good friends. I knew 0 people coming down here and only three of them I was actually good friends with. The other five were more acquaintances. I already semi-knew my roommate, she went to school in the same district, and we met through our parents. We have since become better friends. I am sure whoever ends up reading this really wants to know all these things, but I figured I might as well write something. Well let's see. I went on a mission trip to LOCNAME this summer. I only thought of this because there is a picture of me and some of the kids we worked with on my desk. It was truly an awesome experience. I am a changed person because of that two week experience. Well I guess I won't get into any other subject. My time is ticking away, funny how it goes by faster when you type. very ironic. and that is about all, thank you! 
__label__label0 hey! I'm typing the first writing assignment for my psychology class. That's PSY000. My professor is PROPNAME. I'm not sure how that's supposed to be pronounced. is it like pen-baker or pen-ne-baker?  I'm thinking that it's the second way. hey it's been two minutes. only 00 minutes left now. what should I type about right now?  I wonder if grammar, punctuation, and spelling matter in this assignment. I doubt that it does. I sure hope it doesn't. I don't feel like capitalizing all my I"s right now. stream of consciousness. what to type. I don't know. I should be able to type faster. my leg is asleep. is this going to submit automatically when twenty minutes are over?  I think I'm supposed to do it manually. I wonder if I'm supposed to leave in errors on this assignment. or am I allowed to use the backspace key?  it's a pretty useful key. the delete key does the same thing as the backspace key except it goes the other way. my fingers are getting kind of tired. is "kind of" correct grammar?  what should I type about now?  well, I'm using a computer in the computer lab in the west building right now to type up this writing assignment because the internet isn't working on my computer. my computer has only been connected to the internet like 0 times since I moved in here. stupid airwave. or maybe it's my computer configuration that's causing conflicts. anyway, why do bad things always seem to happen to me?  these kinds of problems always seem to happen to me. I'm like the only one here whose internet connection isn't working. hmm. I hope we weren't supposed to divide this assignment into paragraphs. or organize it or something. I feel like playing the guitar now. I want to improve. I don't think adri is in his room right now so he can't help me now. I don't think keerthan is in his room either. what's up with the weather these past two days?  my fingers and wrists are feeling a little tense now. it's been raining like on and off frequently around here. hey it's been 00 minutes now. 00 minutes have passed since I last mention the time limit. I think. and now there are about 0 minutes left. man, this is taking longer than I thought it would. or it feels longer. hey look at that finish button. I want to click on it. but it probably wouldn't be a good idea. click-click-clickety-click. dot dot dot. I'm bored. and tired. crap, I got to do that experiment thing for this class too. I wonder if he minds if I use slang in this assignment. is "got to" counted as slang? I'm kind of hungry. not hungary. that's a country. well I'm not really very hungry. I just had lunch a couple hours ago. it wasn't that good. the tomato sauce for the pasta is too chunky. and the liquid part is too thin. yeah, not good stuff. hey I got a three day weekend. I like fridays, but I don't like wednesdays because I have four and a half hours of class then. and I have zero hours of class on fridays!. weeeee. doing homework on my free day. hey less than a minute to go. I wonder if the pennebaker gets tired of reading all of these assignments. or if he even reads them. can I get brownie points from this?  pennebaker is cool!. hey a pop-up just told me that my twenty minutes are up, so I'm going to click that finish button now. 
__label__label0 I have no clue how to start this. I haven't bought my psychology book yet. Is that bad? I wish I could do that DJ thing at the beginning of class. The guy last time played horrible music. I made a friend in that class named PROPNAME. She seems cool. I hope we get to hang out. This feels like a diary entry. Is that what it's supposed to be like?  Today PROPNAME and I went down to a free barbecue thing and met some new people. One girl we met reminded my of my ex-boyfriends new girlfriend. It really got on my nerves. Not because I'm jealous, just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation. PROPNAME is really annoying me. I'd like to just stop talking to him altogether. But hang out with him at the same time. And PROPNAME. I don't know what to do with PROPNAME. I don't know if I love him or not. I don't know if I'll ever really be in love. He says the sweetest things to me, so it's easy for  me to say sweet things back to him. But I don't know if I really feel it or not. I think I'm really heartless. And I haven't been in English for a long time! I'm forgetting whether to capitalize the I" in some words. Odd. My arm hurts. Am I going to have to keep this up for 00 minutes? I wonder if some people write really poetic things in their stream of consciousness writings. Mine is all boring teenage bullshit. Let's try and write something deep. It's quiet in the dorm hall, save the occasional dorm slam. All the girls are in their rooms, wasting tears on heartless boys and wasting brain cells on pointless worksheets. The faint shimmer of hope of the future they saw on the first day of college has almost completely faded, all in a couple of days. Soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous, and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future. Aaaand I'm spent. That was so lame. Bullshit, as my English teacher would say. He is really cool. He made us write about a chair the other day, which was very interesting. And he taught at LOCNAME, which is my ORGNAME. I would love to go to school in LOCNAME. Hopefully next year I can go to ORGNAME and be near PROPNAME and see if this thing will really work out. Are boys the only thing on my mind? Am I really that shallow? At this moment, I'm afraid so. I blanked. I have to start a new stream. I'm losing a lot of weight, I think. My wrists are smaller than they used to be. I don't know why that waifish look appeals to me. I want to be super skinny. And if not eating is how I have to get there, I just might do it. I don't think I'm fat right now. There are just parts of me that could be smaller. And I'm too lazy to work out, so not eating will solve all of these problem areas. I'll be the anorexic that always eats Milky Way. Because those are so good and I could never give them up. When do I become an adult? I have no clue where that came from. But really. When? It's really quiet in here. I can hear PROPNAME typing on occasion. She is a good student. Always on top of things. Our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in. The other day it smelled like Clam Chowder. Not pleasant. I miss my family. I never thought I would. I don't miss them so much that I'd cry or be terribly homesick. I mainly miss the meals. And the fact that if I was sick they would go and buy me what I needed. I took birth control for the first time on Friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me. It made me appreciate my mom so much more, which I rarely do. Yes, I am a spoiled brat. I didn't get as much stuff as other brats did, but I am one nonetheless. And I have no concept of money because I am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in October to go see PROPNAME again. And my mom will be furious at me if she finds out. I'm not going to tell her this time. I'll give PROPNAME all the information. And pray my parents don't come down for a surprise visit. I like our dorm room. It has a lot of character. I love our posters. PROPNAME and I have the same tastes in a lot of things. Of course, I'd much rather have my best friend PROPNAME as a roommate. I miss her so much. And with her, I do miss her to tears. She is the only one I could be myself around. I love her so much. And feel horrible about what I did to her last year. I blew her off. I wasn't a good friend. And I'll never forgive myself for it. The girls across the hall from us just got home. I don't like them that much. PROPNAME is nice. She listens to PROPNAME. And, however stereotypical that is, we think she is gay because of that. Most PROPNAME girls are lesbians. And PROPNAME, the other girl, is really stuck-up. And she listens to lots of local bands from LOCNAME that I despise. So yes. It takes a lot for me to warm-up to people. I'm very selective with friends. Which I shouldn't be because I'm not the coolest person to hang out with. And boy do I have low self-esteem. I constantly put myself down. PROPNAME gets annoyed with it. And I type really hard, too. I think PROPNAME is annoyed with this sound right now. Oh well. Seriously, is someone going to read this? Is there a right or wrong way to do it? I hope not. I'm sure I'm doing it the wrong way. PROPNAME just told me that he is joining the army. I don't want him to. And I told him why. And he told me not to be punk rock because I'm an indie princess. That's so lame. Just because I listen to that kind of music doesn't mean I can't have political views. And this was a good exercise. Very therapeutic. Thank you, Professor! 
__label__label0 There are many things going through my mind right now. However, I just wish I would have girlfriend. I keep thinking I want one, but I'm not really sure if it would be really good for me. Looking around right now, I see my stuffed animal duck, my computer with its blue neon lights, my 0. 0 speaker system, and my printer. I really love my sound system. The two sony speakers provide a great midrange, the 0 small logitech speakers give good highs, and my subwoofers provide all the bass I need. My headphones are really nice too. I can?t believe I got them on sale for $00. what a deal. I played Warcraft 0 tonight for seven hours. I look back and don't believe that I actually played that long, but I did. After playing my first three hours, I decided to take a break. But that game is too addicting. I just finished and now its 0:00 am and I have nothing to do. so I figure I might as well write my psychology stream of consciousness paper. My roommate is fast asleep. He really needs his sleep. He gets a good 0 hours a night while I only get my 0 or 0. However, I take a bunch of naps to make up for it. He is a really great roommate. I intend on rooming all four years with him. He respects my space yet jokes around with me when its time to have fun. He keeps our room tidy and clean so we won't be living in a pig pen. My cell phone is really nice. I can't believe I got it for free. ORGNAME sucks though sometimes. I never get reception in my dorm room or in any of the buildings. So if people call, I never get any notice, which can be frustrating. I really miss my best friend kenny. He is in st. louis right now. He just got grounded for staying out all weekend without coming home. Now I can't talk to him or even get in contact with him. I really miss him. I wish that he and his aunt wouldn't have been fighting. If that were the case, he would still be in houston right now. This paper is really interesting because its putting down everything I'm thinking. I'm thinking whatever and its just coming out. my mind is not really in a solid thinking mood. probably because it is 0:00 am. My mind feels jumpy right now. I am still looking at my computer monitor and the duck that sits on top. I'm really glad we lofted our beds in our dorm. It gives us so much more space. Under the bed is our desk which has my computer. On the adjacent wall, our tv sits between the two dressers. I really miss home. Its nathans birthday today, and I won't be home to wish him a happy birthday. That just reminds me that I have to call him tomorrow or else he may get upset. I?m getting my postit notes out right now but I can't find a pen. where is it? oh. there it is. PROPNAME is fast asleep. How can he sleep so early?  well. I guess its not THAT early. Looking at my walls, I have 0 dave matthews posters, an art poster and a ?better luck tomorrow? movie poster. On one wall are all my pictures from my senior year. I really miss my old friends that aren't going to UT. Austin is fun though. I have made so many new friends through basketball, classes, and just walking around. I find it really hard to remember names though. I feel bad sometimes because I have to ask the person 0 or 0 times what their names are. I miss anh back at PROPNAME. I like her a lot. she is just one of those people that are easy going and relaxed about everything. I wonder how this year I have gotten so lazy. I'm too lazy to study for my classes and I can barely make myself do the homework assignments. I use to be so studious. I guess that was before I had a good computer and a basketball gym. plus. I had my parents around back in houston bugging me to do things. I'm really glad I'm not working though. I can now concentrate purely on school. However, I need to start getting back into the swing of things so I won't fail my first semester. my classes aren't difficult, so I better get a 0. 0. Ok. I have two minutes left. My mind is starting to shut down. I am getting tired. I'm not sure if I can stand the 0. 0 minutes left. This is pretty hard towards the end when you are tired and can't think of anything. My mind feels like jello. Looking out my window, I see the tower. I'm so lucky to get LOCNAME LOCNAME 0th floor. My room view is absolutely amazing at night. I think it is weird how my mind works. 
__label__label1 So this assignment is sort of interesting. It's like your thoughts go faster than you think regardless of the speed at which you type. Oh, my, that guy in my keyboarding class during my 0th grade year in high school, so sad, I remember he has special assignments because he couldn't handle writing a paragraph. The teacher was lucky if she could get a sentence out of him. What was her name? . I have no idea, I remember seeing her at the mall one day during junior year, and she recognized me. Probably because I was one of the only kids who took her seriously. Poor gal, it had to be hard to be ignored like that all of the time. At least she was really sweet, so people didn't have real hate for her. Ah, the days at PROPNAME. I can't' believe my roommate is in the Longhorn Band, actually the Flags. I wonder if she will quit. She doesn't seem to have the time to devote to it. Yesterday a returning flag member quit for those reasons. I wish she wasn't so irrational. The day she said she was going to quit, and she got that jar of candy so she stayed~! What is that?  Candy doesn't make you have time. Let's be a little more mature here. Get your lips ready?  What. it's posted on her computer, I haven't quite figured her out yet, I don't know if I ever will. My friends seem to hate her from the stories I tell, and I'm not sure if I blame them. Ah, roommate hell, who does not' experience it. At least we aren't fighting yet. And her stupid camera. I can't' believe she complains about not having money yet she spent 000 dollars on a digital camera. So now she has something else to take up her time, learning how to use it. So so so unproductive. I wonder if she wants to study for the chemistry test together. I hope not, I don't think she is even started the homework and it's due tonight at 00, Oh, well I should stop worrying for her. I haven't looked at our fire escape plan, wonder if it's ever been used. I would imagine so with the kitchen downstairs and all, at least the building is only two stories, I guess I have a better chance of getting out this way, in case of a fire. My closet light is still on, and I want to turn it off a lot, but I shouldn't get up from the computer so I'll just keep thinking about it for the next 00 minutes, oh well, nothing I can do about it now. And on the closet light, I can't believe we had to have a sticky note up by the light switch for a week signifying which switch went to what. PROPNAME couldn't manage to remember that the room light was the bottom one. I guess I am just critical of her lack of comprehension and common sense. I learned where the word common sense comes from while reading the Psychology textbook. I bet if I thought about if for a second I'd remember what it was. I think it was an incorrect believe that involved the word commas. I'll look it up when I finish. I think it was in chapter one. I have managed to read so much for that class, but I'm still a little behind, only halfway through chapter four and I'm supposed to be done by 000 this afternoon, I really should read like three chapters of that this weekend, I find it fascinating and I want to read it, but my friends have been getting in the way of my studies. That's probably a bad sign. I need to get through to them that I am here to learn. Having fun just comes naturally and doesn't require the effort that learning does. I agreed with PROPNAME in the handout that you have the opportunity to be in two classes if you read the textbook, and I want to. It's like I built up the desire to learn over the summer from doing nothing, absolutely nothing. I really should have had a job. I made a total of like 000 dollars this whole summer, probably spent like 000 or more. I'm so bad about that. Hopefully I will grow out of that habit through the years of college. I haven't even written a paper in probably almost four months. I hope when I take masterworks of lit I don't have too much analytical writing to do (false hope). Sigh, candy. I really need to watch what I eat, this whole freshman fifteen will really scare a girl more than people would imagine. I am not going to let myself get all blubbidy. well it's the word that came to mind and that is what they asked for. I wonder if they analyze this crap. Like how though. It would be like measuring how many times people say I, or say something negative. ha, I'd take the cake on that one. I should work on my negativity. but that's not something that can just be changed overnight. I should just slowly work on focusing on things more bright and enjoyable. If you focus on the negative for too long you become depressed and nothing makes you happy. And I'm a little prone to that being as homesick as I am. I just miss the people. My best friends, people who's opinions of me are solidly formed and won't change overnight. Screw PROPNAME!  My stupid friend I met here who's already decided he doesn't want to be around me after being full-fledged into our friendship he tells me I'm fake and intimidating. buck up pal. my other friends agreed with me though, I really haven't changed much, he just works me up in his head and then I'm just regular old me in person and he gets himself disappointed. I hope we don't have any, or many, awkward encounters. We shouldn't. He is all into his Liberal Arts stuff. and I'll never be in that area. I love engineering for that. I don't have to take many classes in stuff that I am not good at or interested in. I don't want to sit around and think about the world and do it in the way I was taught. But I don't want to be a snotty engineer who thinks that I'm better because I'm studying math. AAAAAHHH, I hate college politics already. The Engineering Dean is really really overconfident in the school. I couldn't believe he told us we were better because our overall SAT scores were better, DUH they were better, the school doesn't have to accept ANYONE in the top 00 percent of their high school. and the rest of the university does! bah. I can't take that sort of unfounded confidence and bragging. And I think I'll encounter it in many of my peers over the next few years. That stupid closet light is driving me crazy. I want to turn it off so much and I only have to wait another three minutes. My roommate's AIM is still on, I bet her cousin, BOOBS, is thinking I'm her and trying to tease her about PROPNAME. I wonder if there are possibilities of this paper being deemed not stream of consciousness and me having to redo it. Maybe. I bet they take a random sample and so some people get caught turning in crap, but others don't, and that guy that pasted the manual just happened to get randomly selected. I wonder if they do the 00 percent thing, simply ten percent of the population, oooooh yeah, I learned so much in Statistics. Except I don't think I'll ever remember the details. Mrs. PROPNAME was such a sweetheart, I hope she is doing alright. I miss my high school, for some reason I don't want to type the name of it. So awkward not knowing who is going to read this. Hopefully I won't be deemed a crazy . haha, along with the clingies, creepies, doodlers, boppers,. factoids save me. and I'm just about done, sad that I kept watching the clock the whole time. 
__label__label0 Okay. This is weird. I don't like assignments like this one. I'm trying to track my own thoughts and feelings; trying to be somewhat original and all I find is nothing really. Seems like deep down I am pretty reserved. Well, actually I know that I am so this is not a surprising. Anyways, there it is . nothing. PROPNAME just got home. She is my sister. She had swim team practice. I think she has more talent than she is willing to admit she has. Does that make sense? Working hard isn't her most favorite thing, though. I bet you wondering why I am expressing myself so badly. It has to do with the fact that English is not my native language. I am German. My real family is still in LOCNAME. So PROPNAME is not my real sister. She is part of the family I am staying with. Now I am going blank again. Let's talk about the family I am staying with then. They are very kind. After all, they aren't charging me anything. Why? That's a longer story. I think my host mom would be an interesting case for psychology. There isn't anything wrong with her. It's just an perfect example for insecurity at its highest level. The funny thing is that nobody would ever suspect this insecurity. And I am sure she would vehemently repudiate such a statement. But it's true. From what I understand you can blame that on her childhood. Her version is that her parents wanted a boy as their first child. Well, it was her they got. Accordingly, her parents made that very clear throughout her whole life. Well, you can derive your own implications. Anyways, she is on a constant mission to prove to everybody how smart and special she is. It goes even so far that she fabricates facts in order to win arguments. Even when you present her with indisputable facts she refuses to admit that she was wrong. She goes as far as questioning well known axioms or pundits. Anyway, I should be talking about myself. I have my own problems. I can't state my feelings. That is as far as I will go because I can't talk about it. Then it can't be cured. Irony. Now I am thinking about UT. It's pretty overwhelming. In LOCNAME my High School graduating class had about 00 people. Yup. But I will do fine. I am just having these high expectations in college. I want to find my dead poet society" - teacher. Someone that will point me in the right direction. That makes learning an adventure. Right now, I still have to force myself to do homework. Time is up!   
__label__label0 Laughing, sad, wondering why?  Failed dreams, friends, lost. Can't seem to get away from people. Why do people change, what happens later on?  Help. Everything seems to come together all at once and fall a part soon afterwards. People never grow up, promises are never kept. Life goes on, right?  Learn to live with people. Learn to get along with those who don't attempt to get along with you. What have they sacrificed yet?  Does anything matter except themselves?  Sometimes you just need someone to talk to. To let understand where you're coming from. Does anyone see what's happening?  How long until everything's back to normal again?  How long until I can trust? What went wrong?  Somewhere, I lost the truth, reason, my smile, yet still I hurt and cry and need. I love this boy. But why is he the only one that provides comfort. It can't be healthy, can it?  How come no one else seems adequate anymore?  Life has to keep moving doesn't it?  But why do things work out this way. What happens in the future?  Where does all of this lead?  questions, questions, questions  I feel like everything is falling a part right in front of me. College changes people, and some people grow, yet some people stay right where they were to begin with. Why don't people understand, or listen, or care?  Overwhelmed, just overwhelmed. Things haven't clicked" yet  Lonely very lonely, need someone to talk to, really talk to and not just over the phone every night, not someone who knows who you are, or someone who cares about you, just someone who will listen and then talk back. who doesn't care if you drink this weekend, and won't judge you by your mistakes or jealousy, or stupidity, or friends. Why do people always compare you to your friends can't you just be you, you don't have to have the same values as your friends, the same beliefs, or the same morals, yet people always seem to worry about you when it's one of your friends who screwed up. hate disgust disapproval attention  I need a hug, I just need to be held while I vent or cry, I need to cry to let everything out, but then I read that venting isn't proven to be healthy, but was it proven to be unhealthy?  And yet vitamins supposedly don't help you but they make you feel better, so can't I vent and cry just so I feel better?  Why don't people change? Do I have a one track mind/   why do I care so much. Maybe I'm the one who needs to change, maybe I need to try out what's bothering me so much, but maybe I don't. I want my own bed, I want my privacy,  is it too much to ask for her stuff not to be thrown on my bed all the time, can't she set it on hers so that I don't have to move it in order to go to sleep, and if you come in at one in the morning and the lights are off, don't leave them on when you leave five minutes later, especially when someone's sleeping. I'm hurt, I feel hurt, and betrayed and I question a lot now, because I used to think that I knew who she was, she used to be a really close friend that I could talk to about anything, yet now all I see is someone in need of constant attention. so how do I know who any of my friends are?  Or my boyfriend?  DO I really know who he is/?  I think I do. but what if something goes wrong?  And I lose him, my best friend, also. what if he gets tired of listening to me, and gets tired of my friends or finds someone else, or gets tired of having to support me?  I'm high maintenance but is that bad, and not in the fashion that I like gifts, I don't really, I just like being held and talked to and spoiled I guess you call it  I really don't know where it all comes from I just expect more in a best friend so that it's harder to live up to so that there's less a change of being hurt or quit on or left behind, or scared or in love, but what is love anyway? 
__label__label0 I want to listen to more music. I don't know what song to download next. But oh well. I love listening to music when I study. I wonder why? I like listening to rock and alternative. That is weird I guess. Most people would listen to classical or other soothing music. But I like studying to louder, cooler music. I guess that makes me weird. I wonder how things are going at home. I want to go back this weekend, but I know that I can't. I have a lot of work I want to do, and I really want to finish my Calculus before the due date. I should sign up for tutoring down at Jester. So far the class has been ok though. I understand what the teacher is saying, and I am not having that much trouble with my homework. I hope my boyfriend comes to see me this weekend. But I know that he is going to be really busy with his internship. He has to finish it soon so that he can pay more attention to his school work. I guess I may be asking to much of him. I don't want to pressure him to come, so maybe I won't mention it. I still wish he could come though. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing? She is like 0 months already. She is getting pretty big. I wonder if she knows that PROPNAME is having twins. So many girls are pregnant back home, that is kinda sad. Most of them are really smart, and they could have done so much with their lives. I'm cold. I wish I could turn of the air conditioner. Well, at least it's better than it being hot. PROPNAME still hasn't figured out how to turn off her alarm yet. It keeps beeping every hour. It is getting on my nerves. I wonder if I take the batteries out if she would mind. I'm thirsty. I should get some water. But I don't want water, but that is all I have. I need to get a job. I don't know how I am going to pay for the spring semester. I can barely pay for the housing as it is. I need more money. I hope everything is going ok at the Ranch. We need the place to do better, or if not than one of us is going to have to quit school. I don't want to quit, but if it comes down to one of us having to leave, then I would rather it be me. My brother is doing well, and my sister only has a year to go. I have only barely started, I can wait a bit longer to go to school. Till then, I can help out at home, and work with my parents at our restaurant. My foot went to sleep. I should move so it can wake up. I have so much work to do today. I need to study and reads a lot of stuff for class. I wonder how my friends are doing in class. I want to see PROPNAME. She should have told me that she got married 0 weeks ago. She said she forgot to tell me that she had gotten married. That is a stupid reason. How can someone forget that they had gotten married? I won't get mad though. I am happy for her. I wonder if PROPNAME will ever ask me to marry him. Sure we have talked about it, and we both have said we want to spend the rest of our lives together, but still. Knowing him, he will get very nervous and scared and not want to ask me because I could say no. It is just like when he wanted to ask me out. I knew he liked me and he knew I liked him, but he couldn't ask me. So I finally made him ask me. I said,? We are not going anywhere until you ask me. ? So he finally did. I hope him asking me to marry him won't be the same way. That is definitely not how I picture my future husband proposing. Well my time is almost up, but I need to keep going. PROPNAME is back in the room. She can never get her days straight. She just left again. I guess she is going to the bathroom. Wow, time is almost really up. Time flies by when you are just typing what your thinking. I think that is really cool. Oh well. My time is up now. But I am still thinking. I have pretty much said my life's story, that is really weird. I thought all I would put down was how my day had gone. You know, like a lot of crap just to fill up space. I should stop now because I have a lot more things to do. I think I will stop now. 
__label__label0 I'm a little nervous about doing this right now because I have to wake up at 000 tomorrow morning for crew practice. My back hurts -- it's from rowing on the orgs, or whatever they call them. I am not a good typist. I have to look down at my hands, and I go so slowly. This really is a skill I should have mastered by college. I feel like an idiot. I'm frustrated with PROPNAME -- I don't really want to go to church on sunday because I know he will be there. I wonder if PROPNAME really didn't call me for a week because I told him he was moving to fast or if it was because he was really sick. I can't believe I saw PROPNAME today; I wonder if he really will ever give me a call -- doubtful, seriously doubtful. I need to turn on my lamp, I can't see and this computer screen is starting to hurt my eyes. I can't believe that PROPNAME really didn't call me today -- even though his name showed up on my phone -- how bizarre!  I don't know how to spell bizaar -- oh well. My left shoulder muscle is hurting -- I think it's because of the position I'm laying in -- this is taking forEVER -- I'm only at 0 minutes. ouch. I just leaned up and turned on the lamp -- much better -- I can actually see the keys, even though you wouldn't be able to tell it by the way I'm still typing so messily. My ponytail is kinda digging into the back of my head -- dangit. I hate that I cuss now -- it makes me feel kinda dirty -- not like skank-dirty, but like not-so-clean dirty. That movie, THIRTEEN, we saw at Dobie tonight was weird weird weird. I can't decide if I liked it at all or not -- it was really disturbing when they showed her cutting herself. It reminded me of PROPNAME when she did that the one wednesday I called her. She was so upset about PROPNAME -- boys are dumb. I don't know why we fall for them so easily. I mean it's got to be our need of acceptance and the comfort/warmth they bring when they hold us, but I can't imagine finding a guy who will actually care about me and not just want to feel me up. I mean really -- what's going on in their heads (or most likely, pants) that makes them so desensitized to us. PROPNAME is wonderful -- the way he told PROPNAME he loved her the first time, the way he just spent 000 dollars on her for her birthday -- I'm so jealous, I don't know what to do. It's dangerous having him as a best friend -- he is just so damn wonderful. I mean, really, any even remotely smart girl would fall for him in a freaking' heartbeat!  Sometimes I can't stand it. He hasn't written to me since I've gotten to school. I'm not a happy girl/camper. I know he is getting ready to go on his nature expedition/survival trip, but why hasn't he had a chance to write me yet?  I've been waiting for him to write me, but maybe he is just waiting for me to write so he can respond. I'll write him this weekend anyway, along with PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I have to get my hollow core door too. I don't even know where to get it -- I'll ask PROPNAME tomorrow. I'm going to have to get online to find directions to a Home Depot or Lowes. I hate not knowing my way around -- it totally sucks -- that's why I loved LOCNAME so much -- it was small enough to where I knew where most of the big things were. And if I didn't know where they were, it wasn't that hard to find it. Here there are massive highways, freeways, loops, overpasses -- all designed to confuse and terrify the new-to-Austin driver. I wish PROPNAME and I were okay enough that I could ask him to take me to do my errands after church -- oh well. I still don't think I'm comfortable enough to be around him. I'm cold. It's weird that I haven't slept under my covers for the last week. I've just slept under a fleece blanket on top of it. My time is almost up -- Good night my dear diary assignment. I hope you go over well. I'm exhausted, and I can't wait to turn out the lights. I have to get up in 0 hours -- ick. 
__label__label1 this is one of the most interesting assignments I've had. Frisbee tomorrow I'll be late. I'm homesick and a bad typer is that the right word oh well All my friends and family enjoying themselves without me (sigh) this getting used to college is a little more difficult than I imagined but I guess that I always have trouble starting something new my legs are tired I ran 0 miles and played Frisbee When I started elementary school I cried and clung to my dad's leg ORGNAMEn't remember middle school Funny how I can remember something farther away than something more recent maybe elementary was more traumatic. Then high school I got really tiny because I think I had a nervous stomach I can hear the girl next to me' s headphones It must be a foreign language We have to do that in French I'm finally getting hungry I thought I never would I need to work out more It is kind of depressing to have once worked out on a team five days a week twice a day with a whole bunch of people now I have to make myself do stuff that is not as fun I go by myself to the gym and to swim at least I found frisbee except they're a little more advanced than me but the practices aren't a s strenuous and as frequent as my old swim practices My room mates sick puking all night I keep washing my hands and the door knob every thing she touches It makes me nervous when people are sick I don't want to catch it and get my life off schedule I mean heck it just got into some kind of routine then I'd go and get sick miss class miss practice and have to get the notes from someone and not fall to far behind that makes me nervous  I used to get sick all the time when I swam every winter I would get some kind of 0- 0 day flu and it would usually mess everything up My training for the meets especially I was so frustrated sometime s I would try and convince myself I wasn't sick and I would just keep going as if nothing was wrong and then bam I couldn't do it any longer I would be so weak and tired I had just made it worse Nothing like making a problem even worse Only three minutes to go and I'm hungry I think I will have an apple they taste mmmm I like to eat fruit I had a boyfriend that pretty much didn't eat fruit or vegetable he liked mashed potatoes and gravy chicken fried steak and all that stuff is fine but you have to balance or your going to die to soon probably unless you have good genes people should take care of themselves         
__label__label1 So I'm a little nervous because I don't know what to do about my fig meeting today. I'm supposed to have it at 0:00, but last week no one was there. I can't decide if I want to go back  out into the heat or just skip it. I wonder if it can count against you if you skip a fig meeting. I feel so stupid about being nervous to email the instructor. I am so excited about this wrist band thing. I wonder who I will go with to the OU game. I can't believe it is so soon. I'm freaking out. I hope I get a date. Lets see. I promised to get me, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME a ticket so I can get three more for other people. I can't believe I am actually seventh in line. I hope the guy wasn't tricking me or lying to me because then I would feel really stupid since I've told a lot of people. Oh well. I don't even know what to right on these things. I really wish I was taking a nap right now. My thoughts don't flow as easily when I am being forced to right about them. And I really don't want to say something that could some how embarrass me. although I do that enough anyways. hmmmmm. This class seems like its going to be really hard. I am so confused about what my major should be. Why in the world did I choose advertising when I really don't think I have any interest in it at all. I wonder if its ok that I'm not capitalizing my I's". I'm so used to instant message typing. it gets hard to used apostrophes and capitalize words. oh well. I hope my cousin is doing ok at her new school. I feel so bad that I haven't talked to my parents so much since I've been here. I don't know if I have even called them twice. That makes me sad, I just feel like I don't have any time. Man , I really want some PROPNAME queso. maybe I'll get some later. I need to get this printer fixed if I want to be able to print anything out. Dang it. I wonder if I need to print out a confirmation sheet for this. Wait that is just for the pretesting. which was extremely long. I wonder if we can backspace on this thing. hah. I'm so excited about this weekend's "white trash party" my phone is ringing. I wonder if I should pick it up huh. I guess Ill just let it ring and listen to the answering machine and see if it is someone important. dial tone. ok and now my cell phone is ringing. ill just look and see who it is. of course its patty. its always PROPNAME. I can't believe I got a yellow wrist band!  Its so awesome. It really annoys me how I always press the Caps Lock button when I'm typing. I think I do it like once a minute. I must be the worst typer in the world. It really grosses me out to find my roommate's hair all over my floor. I don't know why she can't just pick up the dust buster once in a while. Oh I need to unlock my door so patty can get in. Oh well, next year's living arrangements will  be better. But that really stresses me out! I can't believe  I have to get my roommates together like before October. How do you even know who are your good friends yet. Well at least I will be with PROPNAME. I wonder if PROPNAME is going to want to room with us or if she is just going to want to get her own group to room with. I'm sad PROPNAME is not going to get an apartment. I don't know why she wants to be an RA. It just seems like way too much responsibility. Oh well. Man I'm hungry , and it is a long long time till dinner. That sucks. Oh good, I thought I lost my Advertising syllabus. but its on my desk that is good. OH yah, I have to go do study hours tonight. That is good. That means I don't have to do my homework now. Maybe I can get in a little nap. Or maybe I should see if my fig is meeting today. I really should work out some. I have totally fallen off track on my working out. It totally stresses me out that I'm probably going to gain like the freshman 00. That is going to sucks. Oh well at least its better than being 00 pounds like last year. Maybe I shouldn't write that on this. Oh well, I tell everybody anyways. I just have like absolutely no motivation to work out. They are right about one thing. PROPNAME might be close, but your bed is so much closer. I hope my parents aren't like shocked when they see me again. lol. Where is PROPNAME. She called like five minutes ago and it definitely doesn't take that long to ride the elevator 0 floors. Maybe she wanted me to bring her down my book. I need to tell her I will need it tonight during study hours. She will probably be upset. Its my book though. I really need to put away some of this clean laundry. What am I going to wear at the White Trash party. I don't know if I really have anything for that. I guess I should go to ORGNAME and get a wife beater or something trashy like that. I really want to wear a trucker hat. Ill borrow one. Okay here she is. F 
__label__label1 Well I've finally sat down to start writing this and I'm wondering where its going to go. I don't feel like I have a whole lot to say though I'm sure I'll end up babbling for the next 00 minutes. Its rather cold in here. I turned on the air conditioning because it was hot and now its a little too cold. I'm borderline shivering. I suppose that is preferable to sweating constantly though as I expected LOCNAME to be. Feeling pretty hungry as well. I haven't eaten since about 0am. I meant to go get some dinner at LOCNAME around 0pm but lost track of time and now they're closed. Its really annoying how they close so early. Even if I were to go eat at 0pm I'd end up hungry again before I go to bed and eating microwavable dinners doesn't prove particularly satisfying or healthy. This laptop keyboard is being a real pain as I try to type this. I'm not used to it at all because I just got this computer yesterday. My poor typing could also be due to the complete darkness in here, I suppose I should turn some lights on but its kinda nice keeping it cool and dark. My roommate is at his engineering lab right now so its pretty quiet. I'm a bit bored as it is. The whole dorm itself is pretty quiet except for the two guys next to us who feel the need to play guitar and sing (poorly I might add) crappy punk songs. Judging by his volume and consistency I'd venture a guess to say he actually thinks he is pretty good. Unfortunately for him, and all of us who have to endure his endless moaning he is quite the opposite. Oh well, I suppose that is part of dorm life. As I thought I would I've found myself making use of suppose, although, and though a little too often. I think that I think it makes my writing sound smarter or something when it in fact usually ends up diluting my points and making for some long sentences (like this one). I just realized I have yet to break this up into multiple paragraphs which makes it rather hard on the eyes. There's a paragraph break just for style points even though there aren't any of those. Speaking of hurting eyes I'm wondering whether this laptop screen might hurt my eyes after awhile. Its at a rather high resolution but its still fairly clear. I don't feel any eye strain so I'm hoping its a non factor. Unfortunately, the fancy (but cheap) office chair I bought is rather uncomfortable after long periods. And I find myself leaning over the desk in a rather uncomfortable manner, both for my back and neck. Hopefully its something I'll adjust too. In retrospect that paragraph break was a good idea. It makes this look much less like some random ramblings although it would be quite obvious that the contrary was true to anyone who was reading this (you). There I go with the 'although' again. Its really rather annoying. My constant use of rather is also somewhat annoying. For some reason I imagine someone with a British accent saying rather everytime I type it. After I wrote those last few sentences I started thinking of pre-testing and its questions that are meant to probe your inner soul. Which then of course prompted me to wonder how one (you) would analyze my constant annoyance with my own writing style. What does this say about me? I don't know, nor do I care. Although (dammit) I would once again venture a guess and say nothing. Boy time flies when you're babbling and rambling. I was hoping for some synonym there but it wouldn't come to me so I just let it go. Thank god I won't be taking much in the way of English courses the next couple years. Writing weekly papers for the last four years has been tiresome to say the least. I feel a headache coming on now. Probably from staring at the computer screen for the last 0 hours or so. Although (I can't stop myself) I've sat in front of one far longer than that before with no ill effects. I often wish I knew all the weird stuff that goes on in the body so I would know exactly what was happening when something started to ache or twitch or some such thing. I recently found out that the twitching muscles in your leg can be caused by potassium deficiencies (I think I butchered that but I can't be bothered to figure out how to spell it). It actually works out nicely that the only fruit consistently in Kinsolving is bananas although (its unbelievable really) they've been a bit over ripe the last few times I went there. Well down to my last ninety seconds. If you were or are hoping for something even remotely enlightening or insightful well you're just flat out of luck. So I've managed to type random sentences here for the last twenty minutes and its worked out alright. I didn't type out the last two numbers because I didn't want to look for them on the laptop keyboard. And I'm done. Yay. Now for more homework. 
__label__label0 Okay so I was thinking about what our dj said in class on the first day that he played some music on the topic that dealt with bot hip-hop mainstream music and trance and how they differed. This was something that I really wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the music makes you feel and I seemed to have noticed a difference. I first tried it out on reading a book. I realized that it was much easier for me to concentrate on what I was reading, as well as, getting more into the book because the trance music makes you think of what you are reading about. When listening to trance music it affects your brain in a way that is very interesting to me and I kinda want to look more into this whole topic of discussion. I am listening to a dj named PROPNAME PROPNAME who is a trance dj, and even as we speak I can feel that beat bouncing all around inside my head causing me to think about what I am writing. Yesterday, last night, actually I was doing some reading and I started to first listen to hip hop and I kept on distracting myself by trying to sing along with all of the different rhymes because I know a lot of them. I ended up spending about 00 minutes and I got through about 00 or 00 pages which is incredibly slow. After that I decide to try out some trance. I actually used to always listen to trance last year when I would read or study because I always helped my expand my mind when I was either designing things, reading, or writing. So when I was reading I noticed that I was much more attentive to what I was doing and got a lot more than 00 pages read in a 00 minute time period. As of right now I am trying out this trance thing again. The funny thing is, is that there is a lot of things going on around me right now. The TV  is on, my roommate is sitting next to me on his computer doing his homework, and my girlfriend is on my bed reading her book, and at the same time we are all extremely focused in all of our own independent studies, not even paying attention to the TV  but to the work that we need to get done. After thinking about this right now I am at 0 min 00 sec and I have already written a lot. I believe that if I would have not turned on the trance music that it would not have given me a basis to explain my theory on what we were talking about in class. Another thing that kinda triggers my mind now that I am talking about class related things, how does this affect your nerves inside your body and inside your brain? how is your body receiving these messages that make you get like this numbing feeling all over your body if you are just listing to music?  I mean does this feeling involve the way the sounds of the music are mixed together? Or is it the repetition of sounds and randomized pitches that might throw off your body's response system that makes you feel all numb inside. Could this be another type of an anesthetic, but instead of a shot, gas, or gel, could it be because of all the sounds and beats like a hearing anesthetic?  Who really knows. But anyway that I am sure has been looked at for a long time. I really am interested though in why trance music makes you feel this way because it really does have a positive effect on me. But right now I really don't know what else I wamt to talk about because I am out of time. 
__label__label1 words are pouring out like endless rain into a paper cup they (?). but I like to use     periods. before, I was tempted to say, last night my ears met their lover. too bad they     didn't. haven't?  I just wanted to use that nice quote I stole from an editor of epitonic. I     have an hour till I have to go to LINK but I really don't know about this whole Christian     organization on campus thing I need to find one that fits me!  oh thoughts and feelings     sometimes I stare out at nothing in particular and it's in those times that I am thinking     about absolutely nothing oh I just got a call. but I'm still typing!  darn you booksellers call     back after nine thirty. I wonder if typos make a difference because I don't like leaving     them behind like that, so careless. So, I need to get a haircut. But how do I know which     kind?  You know, some people just look good no matter what. I think it's a level of     achievement that I will never reach. Oh well. What if people were the same inside and     outside?  Like, for example, if all the pretty people were extremely good souls. Now that'd     make things different. I can't really imagine what it'd be like, because I'm so busy thinking     about what I should write next. Man, what should I pursue?  My stomach is really full. I     used to think that if I ever smoked, I could quit anytime, just because it seems so gross. Well I can't even moderate my eating habits. And I bash myself about it, but when hunger     calls, I respond. In full!  So yeah. Sometimes I fear for my safety when I'm walking around     at night. Nothing ever bad has ever happened but I think I should still be careful. But I     don't think so enough since I'm going to do it tonight anyway. I'm going to watch the     LOCNAME at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Theatre. Yeah. Hey. I wonder if I'm going to make     any good friends here at college. It's bad hanging out with old ones all the time, and     believe me, sometimes I just don't want to. Excuse me. I just sneezed. What if I do really     think in sentences?  I think I have a cold. My nose is rubbed pretty raw (well, not really)     from all the tissues. I'm not thinking about anything. Actually, what I would like is to     complete everything I need to get done soon. I don't know how possible that might be but     then that would leave me time to do leisurely activities, like reading and responding to     other people's e-mails. I'm so bad at that. And so I could have time to read the Bible and     pray. Ah, I cannot control what I do, or at least I'm not trying hard enough. It seems so     easy to be a good Christian when the pastor is talking about it but then laziness gets the     best of me. Oh I can wait. You know, I don't want to think I'm invincible. I want to make a     difference and experience life fully. The things I am most scared about now: public     speaking. I just want to die when all eyes are on me- the bigger the audience, the more     humiliating. You know, it's not like I can control how I feel, to an extent at least. I am also     afraid of getting into a car accident because my close friends just did and it seems     unbearable, the time in the hospital spent recovering. So many tubes. I'd cry out. And I'm     afraid of falling off my bike or getting into some other bike related accident. It's not so     much the pain that bothers me, but the public scene it would cause. How embarrassing. Oh well. Sometimes I don't care what other people think. Sometimes I wonder what they     think of me. When I'm shy, I tend to come across as being mean. I haven't really opened     up to anyone before. Why should I if I don't trust them or if I'm not sure that they care     about what I feel or think. I think I'm good at observing people in their behaviors. When     I'm talking to someone, I can tell if they lose interest in what I'm saying. At that very     moment when they look away for a second. I don't feel bad when that happens but it just     makes me lower the probability of me finding someone or some people who can connect     with me. I know. People need people. And I need a tissue right now. Is this going to be     read?  If it is, it's okay. I don't know if my thoughts are interesting, but it would be a fun     thing to grade. I feel like I'm spending less quality time when I'm reading out of my     textbooks. I want to go back, but then I just get this feeling of urgency. Even when I'm     surfing the net. Imagine that. What do I have to do anyway?  What's the difference     between an erection and an ejaculation?  I think I might know, but it doesn't matter so     much to me. I don't like it how professors can say whatever they want to say, like curse     words and sex related and other inappropriate topics. Just because they can talk about it     doesn't mean they should. Sheesh. I also don't like how repeated exposure to talk I don't     agree with and cuss words will desensitize me to it completely, probably by the end of the     semester. Here I am in college and I don't know everyone but a lot of them are making me     less pure. I don't think they realize what they're doing to the rest of us. What rest of us,     you ask?  I guess we are a minority then. I wonder what I'm going to do for the final     project in my freshman seminar. Either fencing, a Christian organization on campus, if I     ever find a good one!  or a concert. Although a concert might be kinda difficult since I'm     not going to one until October 0th. Yay for Beulah!  I'm so excited. When I go to shows, I     feel like I belong. I don't know anyone there, but I like to observe them. Most of them     have styles. I wish I had a style. I want to be like them. Or do I?  I want to be like me!  But,     I need to be more like me then. Maybe if I had a lot more money. I do have a lot of     money. What does being fashionable feel like?   Not as great as I think, of course. It just     hurts to see people wearing things out of fashion when they think they are in fashion. We     are the elite. At least my mind can distinguish between the two. But only street. What do     I make of myself then?  It's easy not to care, but it's not so easy to do that completely. Will     that make people like me more?  Is it easy to avoid everyone and keep to myself?  Is that     what we were meant to do?  The answer is no. What if it's different for me?  Everyone dies     alone, right PROPNAME?  I think I need clothes to reach the next level. Of making me satisfied. Oh, if I had a different body. No, no. That's alright then. People who know you don't care. It's the people you are trying to impress who care!  Hah. I wonder if I ever hurt anyone's     eyes. It pains me to think so. Before I left for college, at the goodbye dinner thrown for     me by my uncle, the message in my fortune cookie (or rather, one of them) was be     yourself and you will always be in fashion. "  I suppose that's valid. Ooh I can continue     writing. Maybe for a bit longer. I wonder what it would be like to be very fashionable. I     mean, come on, I already struggle against feelings of superiority when it comes to music. What good does it do?  There are always better, there are always worse. But I won't say any     more about that. You know, I can't give all of myself away    and to a stranger!         (ok, I finished editing my paper)_ do you think that this (spilling out thoughts on paper) is     healthy for all of us?  not that it's not, but compared to making no difference    I think so. 
__label__label1 I'm hungry, but I don't have any of the food I normally eat. If I had a car, I'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more PROPNAMEoplex (protein shakes) and some cereal and some milk, but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such, so they wouldn't let me bring my car this semester. If I had gone to school out of state, like both my brother and sister did before me, I wouldn't be getting a car for the entire first year, but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was, and I have some scholarships on top of that, my parents are considering letting me bring my car to Austin at semester. I really don't know where there's room to park a ORGNAME ORGNAME in this town, but I'll find some place. My car would have been nice to have last last Sunday morning, because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse, which is too far to walk to, and I ended up not being able to go because I couldn't find a ride. I was pretty upset, but My PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team, told me to go to practice this morning anyway, and the coaches wouldn't mind. He was right. I just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that I wasn't able to attend, went through the workout, and they told me to come back on Wednesday. It was a lot tougher than I would have thought, in some respects, but a lot less strenuous in others, when I look back at it. The one mile jog wasn't hard at all, and neither were the pull-ups, but eventually the sit-ups wore me out, and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets. I think that's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before, which was a bad move on my part, but it's hard to say. I've never done jump-squats before, so I might have felt sick afterwards without being sore. We didn't get to go out on the water, which was somewhat disappointing, but the group of guys I was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday, while the other groups run body circuits, since that's all our group was able to do. We did actually take a boat down to the dock, and set it in the water, but I wasn't able to get in, and the boat never left the dock, so it wasn't as much fun as it could have been. I'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session. We get to use the rowing machines for the first time, and I've never used one before. I'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze, or if I'm really going to throw up this time. I work out 0 days a week, and I run, and most of my workouts are repetition, not heavy lifting, so I could definitely be in worse shape for rowing, but I'm still not sure how far away I am from the kind of endurance I need for the urgs" (rowing machines. )  I would actually be stronger, but have less endurance if my shoulder hadn't been giving me problems all through high school. I pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the LOCNAME LOCNAME airport after a two week cruise through LOCNAME LOCNAME. We went to the doctor, they told me to lay off it, and I did, but apparently it wasn't long enough. I was too anxious to get back in the gym, and I never let it heal completely, so about six months later I hurt it again. Six months after that, when it happened the third time, my parents took me to a doctor, and eventually to physical therapy. The therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals, triceps, biceps, and deltoids. Apparently I hadn't trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body, which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements, where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder. The doctor was amazed that both shoulders hadn't been more severely damaged, but I was told that I wasn't beyond repair. A full month of therapy, very specific exercises, cross-friction massages, and ice massages helped a lot, but my shoulder is still pretty fragile. If I push myself too hard on the bench press, or if I don't put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout, it's sore for the next few days. I'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back, especially the scapular region, so I can push myself harder at the gym when I'm training the rest of my upper body. The pull-ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that I can feel had been neglected, because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull-ups. Apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work, so I'm happy with the training so far. I was actually worried for a while that I wouldn't be able to train the rest of my body if I got serious rowing, but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps, so the rest of your body will need developing too, like your chest and triceps. This means I can still go to the gym, and I actually have more reason now than ever, because I have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that I will undoubtedly be developing. Running and jump-squats in training won't come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout I want, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day. I suppose that after a few weeks of real practice, assuming I make the team, I'll be able to decide when to work my legs, and how hard. Some of the guys there seemed to have been working out, or playing football in high school, because they were pretty used to running body-circuits, and jogging, and weren't too beat at the end of the day. Some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness. A few people vomited, one guy passed out, and I heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing. I'm not sure exactly what was going on there, but I'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet. I can't wait for it to get cold outside, so I can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse. It was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 00 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator. Once it gets colder, I'm sure I'll have to buy a sweatshirt, and some warmer gym shorts, but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse. It'll be a lot colder if I fall in the water too, but I'm hoping that won't happen too often. 
__label__label0 Basically right now I am feeling a little bit stressed out. I have to go to this Fiesta tonight for my sorority and I think it will be really fun, but we have to dress up. I have no idea yet what I am going to wear. On top of all of that I have class pretty much all day today. My Freshmen Seminar is really interesting, but we stayed last week for the entire 0 hours and that is just kind of a long time to be hearing about libraries. For some reason I am also feeling kind of overwhelmed by school. I don't know if I am behind or if I will be prepared for the tests or what. I always thought that I would have so much more time in college because I wouldn't be at school for 0 hours a day, but for some reason I never seem to have enough time. And wow, right now I am really tired. I wanted to try to get to sleep kind of early last night so I could wake up early today and get some things done, but of course that didn't happen. I'm also pretty hungry so I need to decide on something to have for lunch. We really need to go to the grocery store because we don't really have any good food. I could go eat in the cafeteria, but for some reason I don't just love that food. I mean it's not really bad, but I just don't really like everything that they  have downstairs. I'm really glad that we have the kitchens in Towers because I like being able to make my own food. Now I'm back to worrying about what I am going to wear tonight. I should have thought about this a lot sooner. I tried to go get something yesterday, but I couldn't find anything. From now on I am going to get all of my costumes together much sooner. My problem is that everyone always goes to do all of that stuff in the afternoon and I always have class in the afternoon. Oh well though! I'm pretty excited about tonight, but I really just don't want to stay out too late. And then one of my friends from high school is coming in to town on Friday so I think that should be really fun. I'm excited to see her. I've been feeling randomly kind of homesick lately, but I am going home for a visit in like 0 weeks and I can't wait! Now I am seriously getting so hungry. As soon as I finish this I am going to make some lunch and I then I have to do some reading. Reading is really the only homework I have, but it is so time consuming and I feel like I always kind of put it off. I don't know why I feel like that because I am not really behind in my reading or anything. oh my, my alarm clock is going off and that is really annoying, I guess I never turned it off. I wonder if there is anyone here. I know my roommate is at class, but I'm not sure whether my suitemates are here or not. It's really quiet so I'm thinking maybe not. I am definitely going to go get a ORGNAME and some lunch after I finish with this. I am so tired, maybe the ORGNAME will wake me up a little bit. Goodness, I just wish I knew what I was going to wear tonight. I think maybe I'll call my sister later and see what she thinks. I just don't know though. My ORGNAME ORGNAME never called me which is strange, but I can't go to the activity today anyway because I have class. Oh well. I think someone just walked in. I wonder which one of my roommates is here. I will have to go check on that and then I have a lot to do before my class at 0. I also need to find a map to where I am supposed to go for my Seminar discussion today. 
__label__label1 This is my first year here at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and I am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations. It is so hard for me because I have had to learn how to get around in such a large town, on such a huge campus, and living on my own for the first time is crazy. I have to find a job because I need to be able to pay my bills and I still have so much school work that I have to keep up with. At the ORGNAME ORGNAME I attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to. Here everything is done over the computer which I guess is good since we are in the electronic age, but I just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face. I miss my family, especially my sister. I moved here by myself and I really don't know anybody here in LOCNAME. I've never had to do so much walking in my life!  I guess I should get all the exercise that I need walking back and forth to my classes. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up in classes. I think I'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and I'm still very overwhelmed by all of it. I just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things. Twenty minutes is a long time to write. I never thought I would feel pressured to think. I guess my thoughts don't come that often or just don't continue for twenty minutes straight. I still have ten more minutes to write. I wonder how these will be graded. I have so much to do today. I need to wash clothes, go to the grocery store, I have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend, and I have a test I have to start studying for. I hope the test won't be too difficult. I always worry about the first tests in a class. They pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester. If you do really bad, then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester, if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester. I wish that all teachers would do a review. Reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because I end up going over it again and again. I guess its really repetition that makes me learn. Man, I still have five more minutes to write. I have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class. I was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class. I bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size. There must be so many distractions for the professor because I know I get distracted just sitting there. In an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes, sometimes your focus drifts away. I think that I'm going to like this class. It seems like it will be interesting and fun. I think that if every class was interesting and fun, then the college would be full of 0. 0 students walking down the street. My finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least. 
__label__label0 how to begin, I have started writing my stream of consciousness paper and now I'm trying to think its hard to think when your are asked to think about thought or your own thought why I feel this is a strange assignment o well I don't smell much right now but I hear the tv which I fixed last night I did a pretty good job even though I still have an extra screw left I'm watching scooby doo its very funny to watch now the commercials are on which I hate its 0 00 tonight I'm going out to eat and to the book store with my friends and maybe to an art museum I'm glad I get to get off campus the football game and weekend start tomorrow I'm excited to see the texas arkansas game as the season progresses the competition will become harder the band is a neat experience I have always liked marching and now I get to do it for a very widely known organization its a lot of fun I have only been typing for 0 minutes this is going to be a long 00 minutes there is nothing I can do to make it go by quicker even if I type slower, no I'm trying to find something else to think about, so I am disrupting my stream which is ironic that I have not really because I'm on a new one and recording it right now which is even more ironic and it will never end . until now. so her ei am looking for my new stream and hoping this assignment will be over soon so I can start my weekend and maybe get some food I'm very hungry now  I have not eaten all day and I'm hungry now I need to get some food, maybe ill get some chick fil a or taco cabana or some kind of fast food most likely seems like that and cafeteria food is all I eat lately its not a very good realization drew just walked in the door he is my roommate he just asked how I watch scooby doo its so mundane" he uses vocabulary to impress people and I just wrote it in my paper to impress people. very ironic as well john ridder died today he is the star on threes company and 0 simple rules and he died on set suddenly its a weird thing I would like to live a long life and maybe die suddenly tho and not have to know I'm dying although I'm not afraid to die I feel I have a place to go though, my afterlife is set many people here don't believe in God and I don't know why it seems to me to be the only answer we have not even figured out the human brain and we dare to declare that there is no being beyond our comprehension we can be a very proud society for a people that can't stop murdering and slaughtering each other anyways I have been trying to help people understand that PROPNAME came to give love and to break us away from sin not to tell us how to live I guess that makes me intolerant many people here feel that me showing what I believe is imposing my culture on them which I guess could be true but I'm not trying to break them from their traditions I'm just trying to . my roommate just started talking, "arafat refuses to leave, and the LOCNAME is blatantly pro-israel. "no, if the us was blatantly pro-israel world war three begins. I stopped following the conversation with california governors my roommates friend is here now and they are arguing politics, current affairs, the such, . scooby doo caught the bad guy, I'm satisfied now, man my fingers hurt and this writing is getting very tiring I wish I could be done now but I have to keep writing they are talking about proposition 00 now bla bla its very hard to concentrate on two things at once but I guess that is what college is about my physics homework is next to me I'm very glad I am understanding most of it I was proud of myself today because I finished most of my hw which is due next monday we have an exam in two weeks and I think I will do very well I also have an exam in this class and I'm very not prepared hopefully I can sit down and read through the text we will have to have read thus far and begin to see what this class will teach me I also remember that I have to do some experiment hours for this class hopefully I will have some free time in the weekend ahead to do some of them  I am beginning to smell food man I am so hungry I'm not thinking about much now because I am so focused on how hungry I am and what I would like to eat yet I'm thinking about thinking about what I want to eat and so forth. this assignment is very weird because you can't have people record what they think because now they are thinking about it so its in a way rigged and it will always be there is now way like this to have people understand how they think because whenever they think about it the point is gone, the twilight zone is on now I love that show me and drew are collecting the videos of them we have 00 episodes now and they are all classic ones the shows are not only always very ironic but they have social issues of the time in them which is very good, I like them, I have seen a lot of movies lately maybe because that is the easiest way to divert myself, its weird how humans always need diversion and now when I can't even write my thoughts I have to divert myself by talking about diversion man I can't wait to see what heaven has to offer, soon enough, only 00 seconds left now I can't wait till heaven its almost here three two one z         
__label__label0 I forgot that we were going to be timed, I wonder if we have to type well, I wonder if everything has to be in complete sentences or even have the correct use of grammar. This is kind of harder than I thought. So should I go back and re-write my first phrases in complete sentences? Oh well, I don't think I will. I'll just keep going. I need to keep typing about something. I need to type what I'm feeling. I'm feeling a little stressed because I have to keep typing all this time. I wonder how long this should be, especially if I have to keep typing for a whole twenty minutes. It's only been three minutes. Geez! I thought this was going to be an easy assignment. Well, it is relatively easy. It's just different from what I expected. I wonder if sarah and Christen have gone to bed yet. I never know how late they stay up because I'm always. oh my phone is ringing! But I can't pick it up because I have to keep typing. Oh well. They can wait. I bet it's PROPNAME. I still haven't met him. But PROPNAME said he wasn't even that cute. He is a sophomore though, so he has at least been interesting to talk to over the phone. I need to call PROPNAME and make sure we can all go out on Friday night. My shoulder is sore. I wish I was a professional athlete who received massages after working-out. That would be so nice. I can't believe I ate those ORGNAME's Treats cookies. I hate that. It takes so much energy for me to get motivated to walk all the way over to the gym and then run three miles. But then I just come home and waste all of the calories I burned off on cookies. I wonder why I get those cravings for sweets. I keep thinking that it would be so easy for me to just cut out all sweets from my diet. I'm running around the track in such pain. I really hate to run. Well, I guess I don't hate it. It does feel good at times, like after you're done and you've accomplished three miles. But while in the middle of the actual running it feels so hard! It takes a lot of mental strength as well as physical strength because you just keep thinking about how much nicer it would be to just stop. I wonder who is actually going to read this? I hope no one expects me to be a proliferated prowess. I don't know if that even makes sense. PROPNAME, my friend at ORGNAME wrote that today in her email. I have such respect for people with an abundant vocabulary. I feel that way mostly because I lack the. see I can't even think of the words. I lack the ability to think of the words. The bottom line is I need to work on my vocab because I just don't have that thirst for expanding my vocab unlike PROPNAME. However, I did pick up a pocket dictionary and a thesaurus while I was getting my school supplies. I realized that my spelling abilities were quite embarrassing. But then ironically when I finally took the time to look up certain words for their correct spelling, I couldn't find them in my dictionary! I never look words up because I just lacked the motivation and then when I finally tried to change my ways and be picky and start paying attention to details, like how words were spelled, they weren't in the dictionary! It just goes to show that I can try but I'm pretty sure that there will never be a drastic change in my abilities to spell or expand my vocabulary. Maybe I need to read more. I need to read the newspaper everyday. I hated hearing that I had to pick up and read a news paper for my government class. My neck still hurts. I need a massage. I would love to just get massages all the time. That would be so nice. I only have two minutes left. It feels like I haven't been typing for very long. I think typing messages to my friends on instant messenger has made me a better typer. I still can't type very fast. almost done. 00 seconds. wow this is a long 00 seconds. 
__label__label0 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME and I forgot my code I'm really sorry my roommate wants to know what this paper is about I answered "stream of conscious no I'm thinking you dumbass and damn that tool in the background sounds awesome.

__label__label1 I am pretty tired today. I haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks. I have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier. I work with the youth group at the church I go to. It is getting very busy there as well. We are really trying to get the numbers back up. After the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little. Right now I am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying. I was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home. We are working construction on our new church building. It is very exciting. We have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. So for the last week they have been breaking through walls. It has been really cool to watch. My coffee smells really good. I am listening to some Audio Adrenaline. They are a PROPNAMEtian band I just downloaded. They sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. I am switching majors this semester from Engineering to a dual major in History and Spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh?  I think it will be good. I got accepted into the UTeach program and so starting this semester I will be in an LOCNAME public school teaching and observing. I will be in the classroom starting next week. I am very excited. My arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. I think they are going to fall off. I have a lot to do today. Since I am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. I think I will be pretty far behind in this class PSY 000 because the Co-OP does not have the book(it is out of stock) They won't have it until Monday the 0th. I'll just have to read a lot next week. I need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. I am trying to sell my truck. It is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. About 00 miles per gallon. I think I will put it on Auto trader and see what I can get for it there. My coffee is done and it is calling my name. Come. Drink me. "   I guess I will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 00 minutes. I am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and I am really tired. I have to read six books for my History class. It's not so bad I have alreay read one of them and have started on another. The first was very boring. I think the rest will get better. This is a good song. I am also taking Chem 000 I think it will be a challenge because I don't really remember Chem 000 that well. I kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. What other classes do I have?. I am trying to teach myself Spanish right now. It is fun. I think I can use Spanish a lot later in life. I hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth/college ministry. But who knows what the big guy has in store for me. College age has a lot of possibilities. I am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. I don't know how that is going to turn out but I think it will be fun. THis last summer me and a couple of friends went to LOCNAME did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed Mt. PROPNAME (which is the highest peak in the LOCNAME @ 00,000)  It was a lot of fun. I and looking at a picture of me and my friend Chris. It is of when we went skydiving last year. That was a whole lot of fun. "People may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do". Reads a poster on my wall. I read it every day to help my fully realize how much more my actions speak than my words. I would like to be a great orator but if somebody could only know my through my life practices and not my life speeches I would want them to say that I had a heart like PROPNAME ". a man after God's own heart. "  That would be the testimony of my life. I pray that I can life according to the beliefs in which I so strongly hold. K0, LOCNAME, PROPNAME  some of the greatest peaks in the world. I someday wish to climb all of them. But we will see how things play themselves out. I think it is so funny how people grunt and groan and try to figure it all out. The things that are above. are always going to be greater than those below. And tru faith means you don't have to have all the answers. The End 
__label__label1 Ummm this is sorta weird. I think its odd that we have to write for 00 minutes about what is going through are heads. I know that sometimes I don't know that I am thinking about something. but I am sure that it is happening. Like when I exercise. I normally don't think about any thing? Or am I? Great now everytime I exercise I am going to think about what I am thinking about and that is going to take away from the effort I put into my workouts. Damm. I should have stayed at the gym longer today. 00 minutes of cardio is not enough. I was not as tired as a seemed. I could be there right now, still burning calories away on the weights or cardio. Are we supposed to go back and read this for mistakes or just submit it because I keep rereading what I wrote that doesn't seem like what we are supposed to be doing. Oh well, I'm a horrible typer. Uhhhhhhh that shower felt good a bit ago but I wish that I had brushed my hair before I decided to start typing. its hanging all around my face and its annoying. Wonder what the meeting is going to be like tonight. I wonder how much different it will be then Crew. Do I really want to get involved in rowing again? Yes. Do I want to do it with a team? Yes. Why because I push myself harder but I also get tired easier. Grades are important. But so is having fun. Rowing = fun. Women's rowing. supposedly they pay for it all, all the costs. What if they don't? Then I can't be on it, that will suck, then I will be sad and then I will have to do something else. But all the other organizations suck. I don't want to be with a bunch of stupid snotty girls in some lame sorority. I work for my money and pay for my car and cloths and food. Those girls whose parents pay for everything suck. I wish my parents could afford to pay 0000 a semester for me to be in something like that but no because I am a normal college student. Man rich people make me mad. I am never going to be rich. I have to do rowing I have to. ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm that was exciting. stupid sorority girls I am glad I punched hilary in the face. I really hope she has a huge bruise on her jaw. But I shoulda stayed there and let her take a swing at me instead of walking away like a little pussy. Naw, there was too many guys around there is no way that they would have let me hit her again. Especially after how hard I hit her the first time. I wish she had taken a swing at me though. That would have been exciting. I could tell everyone that I got in a fight with a girl. Not like I am trying to fight with people or anything. But she had no right to write that shit on my sisters shirt and tif was just going to take it. man if I was in tifs spot and hilary had written that on my shirt I would have had someone immediately tell me what it said I would have hunted her down in the party and whooped her so bad. but because tif isn't like me I had to do it instead. That makes no sense. It sucks having a twin. Wait it doesn't suck but I don't understand. Why did I get so mad about that. Would I have done that if hilary had written that on Audreys shirt? Probably not. Interesting. Ohhhhhh psychology could make an interesting case study out of me right now. Haha twins. why are people so interested in studying us. We are two separate people. Can't they understand that. I am glad that I didn't participate in that testing they wanted us to do last year. No way are you going to get me to sit in a sound proof room by myself with wires attached to my head, by myself for 0 hour. LOCNAME. You would have to pay me more then 00 to do that. And then they wanted me to answer a set of personal and non personal questions about myself. ohh they would remain confidential. So  I don't want ANYBODY knowing about my sex life, drug use or problems or things I do to stay happy and be fit. That is my business. Man. and then they want to compare all my information to my sisters. the good twin and try to make me look bad. I can see it in the journal article now. 'A study at the university of texas reveals that twins have opposite personalities. If one had used drugs in the past this proves that. blah blah blah if one is fatter this means. blah blah blah. Erhhhhh I am not sure exactly how much I am going to like this class since it has to do with studying stuff like that. Man I am worried now about what I just wrote everything is so negative and m,ean. I am really not like that I am not in a bad mood either . it just feels like since we have to write this is all the stuff that I have been thinking about when FORCCED to write. I don't always think as mush as I have in the past 00 minutes. great almost done 00 seconds left. I am going to type really slow now just to finish. 00. glad I'm done  
__label__label1 this is really boring, I'm so tired, I think I might take a nap after this but I have to write my social work notes. I wonder what will is doing in his class right now, I think this exercise will show that I think about him too much. I wonder if stacey is in class. did angel get the message I sent to her cell phone? should I go home this weekend? if I go home, I think I'll want to stay there, but if I don't go home I'll miss seeing my lil brother and I know he really wants to see me, its a good thing I haven't told him I'm thinking about it yet. I really want to get me and will tickets to the football game and to the austin city limits music fest. I wonder if by getting him tickets I'm encouraging him to ditch class. I don't want to encourage him to do that, I want him to do well more than anything because I know that he wants out of ORGNAME so bad. I hope that he stops hanging out with that arthur kid so much, that kid is trouble. he isn't going anywhere. will has so much potential to go so many places, and arthur is just going to drag him down. omg its only been three minutes. this is crazy, I type fast and there is going to be so much stuff here. I wonder if my hands will hurt at the end of this. I guess it is keeping me awake. I'm so tired, I just want to sleep once in awhile. I actually did sleep last night, I only woke up once I think. its so hard to sleep, I don't know why. its probably because of this horrible dorm, with its horrible smells, horrible neighbors, and the massive amounts of noise associated with traffic outside. I was so tired that I took a freakin nap at russ and will's apt. awwww. russ is so awesome, I think he might be one of the best people I know. I wish more guys were like russ. I wish will would start being more like russ and a lot less like arthur. arthur is so dull. who in their right mind only thinks about parties, drinking, and easy girls? he is so one dimensional, and will is so much more than that. I wish he could make more friends that actually have substance. I wish I could make more friends too. oh, I made a friend today in sociology. I let her borrow my notes since she said she wasn't in class. slept through or something. that sucks. I hope I don't do that, but since I have no friends here, its not really a possibility right now. man, I feel like such a pathetic loser here. I have friends, I really do, I keep telling myself this. but I don't think anyone here believes me. I walk around all alone all day, and only talk to people when I have to. its such a pathetic existence. then I come back, study, run errands or work out, eat, and sleep. I talk to my friends online a lot, and on the phone a lot. I wish they were here. I hope that russ and will are here next year, and that nicki, stacey, maris, kayla, tracy, and everyone ends up here. maybe plunkett will too, that would be fun. I wonder how he is. I hope he is ok. he doesn't talk to me too much. I think he probably does miss having everyone around. I wonder if marc is ok. I think underneath his happy front he is the saddest person I know. weird. he is a great person though, good heart, good intentions, doesn't always follow through though. man, I wish I was back in january. january was the start of an awesome semester of high school. I think I was actually popular in high school, which is weird to think about. I was never like the prom queen or anything, but I had about a ton of friends, and I knew they were all loyal. they were so great, they still are great. I miss hanging out with my guys. they were so much fun this summer. craziness. and my girls, I want to go dancing with them. there are so many clubs here, and it would be so much fun if we all went. but for some reason, its not as much fun going with ppl I don't really know that well, and don't care to hang out with. like christyn soland. ha, I was actually glad that she went to san antonio with me this weekend. I felt kinda bad for ditching the YL ppl, but I think it would have been awkward for them with me around, esp since they think so horribly of me. I don't want to be around ppl that hate me anyways, or are fake friends to my face. I don't know, I tend to bash her a lot, and esp will does too. we hate her mutually, ha. damn, we should just go out or something. I can't believe his mom thought we were. I can't believe everyone thought we were. that is so strange, I wonder what he thought about it, but he didn't seem to care at all when stacey told him. he kinda just stared at us with an apathetic look on his face. I wonder where that frame I made him went. he seemed to really think it was cool. I'm so glad we got to go to lunch and hang out. I really want him to be here with me next year, but more than that I want him to get out of ORGNAME and be somewhere he really wants to be, whether that be here or not. I wonder if he wore that burnt orange polo to the game last week. I hope we get to go to a game together, that would be so much fun. we have fun together I think. I can't believe that I miss everyone so much, and I can't believe that I care about him so much, as a person, as a friend. its scary. its like the whole robby thing. robby. I wonder how he is. I can't believe he had a girlfriend. I wonder if he still does. he was such a great guy, he still is I'm sure. he thinks he has to define himself now by drugs or smoking or horrible music. I'm not understanding that. I wonder if wonkie is doing the same thing? I can't believe she would smoke. I bet she couldn't believe I would drink. why does armando think I would give it up to will. I may like the guy, but that doesn't mean I want to jump in a bed with him. I hope he was just kidding. I wonder why robby went off the deep end and pushed everyone away. I hope that doesn't happen to will, I hope he doesn't push me away. if he pushes me away, he has arthur left, and russ, but he will push russ too I'm sure if he pushes me. I hope that arthur falls off a cliff and breaks both his legs and arms, and has to leave ORGNAME so that he doesn't ruin will. I hope that he doesn't kill him. it made me almost cry when russ was kidding about that. it makes me so worried when he says he doesn't mind getting into a car with drunk arthur. I know he knows its wrong. does he think trying to validate it to me will make it ok? what would I do if he died and I was the last one to talk to him, and I knew he got in a car with a drunk arthur? I would feel guilty. but there's nothing I could do about it. I couldn't stop him. there's no way. he is making decisions on his own now. well I don't think he is doing a very good job of it. why does he tell ppl that he got high or drunk and decided to go to utsa? I know he remembers that it was me saying he should go for it. I convinced him to go there, like he convinced me to go here, and now we're both not happy. I think I handle it better. I don't know that running away to san antonio to see him/everyone is better, but at least I'm not screwing things up by being drunk all the time and fo 
__label__label0 I guess I should begin by saying I'm pretty tired today. I woke up feeling sort of sick. My throat hurt a little bit, and my body ached as well. The dorm rooms are really cold. I went to the financial aid office for some information but I don't even remember how to access what the lady told me to. I've been thinking a lot lately and worrying about school. I'm worried about this college algebra class I'm supposed to be getting into through ORGNAME. They said they haven't received my transcript although I know it was sent from LOCNAME on August 00, I even have the receipt. It pisses me off that ACC's records department is screwed up. This class is really important to me so that I can take my core classes next semester or so. Besides that stress, I've been stressed about PROPNAME. It doesn't really feel like we've been broken up. I know it's only been a week, but it doesn't feel like it to me. I think he is really more upset about it than me. My cell phone bill should be coming in the mail soon and I know my dad is going to kill me because it's going to be super expensive. The guy sitting next to me in this computer lab is typing super fast! He reminds me of the part on Meet the Parents" where he is at the airport looking for a different flight and the clerk types really fast and finds nothing. Makes me smile. Tomorrow I think I'll go to ACC's records department. I mean, I have a receipt that says I sent the transcript, so I wonder what kind of run around they will give me this time. Last time they were extremely rude to me. I mean, I'm new to all this, especially to ACC. It's not like I knew they would lose my transcript. The computer lab down here in the basement of Jester is pretty hot. I don't feel an air-flow. Just still air, and the typing of the guy sitting next to me. He just left right now. I heard him talk on his cell phone a few minutes ago about getting something to eat, which sounds good to me right now. I had some oreo's while in class today, and my friend PROPNAME was talking about how fat she is gotten, the girl is super skinny, not to mention in great shape because she runs 0 miles a day! But she was saying that oh my gosh oreo's are so fattening, yet she would kill for one. I offered her one, but she declined. I thought to myself oh my god! What is this girl thinking. All she talks about is what she eats and doesn't eat. It was kinda getting on my nerves, but oh well. I enjoyed the oreos and that's all that matters. I didn't feel guilty about eating them since I am probably going to go to the gym later on tonight. I wish I would have had some milk with those oreos though! New guy sitting next to me in computer lab. I hope he doesn't glance over and wonder what I'm doing. I guess I am pretty focused on my computer screen. I feel relaxed though. The chair is comfortable and my gum still has flavor. Still too hot though. I guess basements are supposed to be a little hot. PROPNAME just left me a voice message that she was going to eat some dinner and if I wanted to go. I hope she doesn't find out I am writing about her! I know I've said nothing bad about her, but I think she could get her feelings hurt. She is a really sweet girl and I really don't have anything negative to write about her. Besides, I don't typically talk about people. I guess I always put myself in the other person's shoes. I wouldn't want people to talk about me! Don't know when I'm going to go home. I miss everyone, but I really like my freedom here. Coming and going as I please. Not having to be home at 00 and calling and checking in. I like being independent. Not that I resent anyone or anything from home, but I like being on my own and all. It feels cool and I feel all grown up! PROPNAME's phone just rang and she is trying to be real quiet! She is so cute! I'm glad she is up here with me because I really don't know what I would have done if she hadn't decided to come to school here. We're really close and I enjoy that. Whoa, I almost thought I lost all of my work because a window screen popped up about some debugging! Scary!         
__label__label0 Well I just got don't talking to my brother. He is doing well. That is good becasue I worry about him, and I don't even worry about him that much until I hear him say that he eats lunch and dinner alone. He is only a freshmen at ORGNAME and it's only been like a week and he has to have time to make friends but he is just not as good as I am at making friends. My mom worries about him too, so that makes me worry even more. It is cold in here. I wish it was warmer, but I have one roommate who likes it hot and one who likes it cold and the one who likes it cold is in the living room and I can't exactly argue since she pays rent here too. oh well. She is watching CSI, which is not something I terribly care for, its an ok show but I have different things that I watch. Her and I tried to go to the gym earlier to play racquetball bt all the courts were full, so we reserved one for tomorrow, but who knows what is going on tomorrow. We rode our bikes there and it is so hot outside, I cannot wait until it gets cold, although I will complain then too but at least the cold is more easy to deal with then the heat at least to me. god the TV is loud, I don't know why its so loud, its just me and her in the room. I have a lot to do and I am putting it off. I have math homework due next wednesday and I need to get it don't before this weekend because my boyfriend is going back home to houston and he is my help for that class. I understand just about nothing in that class and it scares me. He is very patient with me and I love him and are very grateful to him that he takes time out of his homework to help me with mine. right now his roommates are mad at him because all he does now is hang out with me and they don't understand why, well they understand but hey don't like it and I cannot help it, its his choice. I am worried about chemistry, I understand nothing in that class either. I thought I was good at chemistry, I wanted to be a pharmacist but now I just don't know and that scares me too. I am feeling extremely overwhelmed with everything right now. LOCNAME is a lot different from ORGNAME. my neck hurts and I don't know why, I didn't get to work out today, since the racquetball courts are full. my roommate just asked me if she could use my garlic. I don't really mind but she always throws a fit when I ask to borrow her stuff, not like its a big deal or anything it just gets on my nerves every now and then. I am so scared about chemistry, I have to ask my boyfriends roommate this weekend to help me figure it out. we have a quiz on tuesday over the stuff we have been learning although I feel like I have not been learning anything. it worries me so much, I feel like I have no direction again. I don't know what I want to be or what I want my major to be and my parents kept asking me and my advisor told me to just choose so I chose pharmacy and now with the chemistry part being so hard and I thought I was going to be good at it, I am scared that I won't be able to be a pharmacist anymore and that will only disappoint me and my parents. I feel like I have no direction and I can't just force myself to have one. I wish that I had something I was REALLY good at but I don't. I have a lot of things that I am good at but not one thing that I really excel in and sometimes that hurts my feelings and makes me feel bad about who I am. wow already been 00 minutes time goes by fast when you just keep typing. I need to shave my legs, now it smells gross in here because of the amount of garlic my roommate used. my arms are starting to hurt because of all the typing only 0 minutes to go. this writing thing is not that bad I think its a good idea I hope thy don't mind all my grammatical errors and or misspellings, why does my neck hurt!  I need to repaint my toenail, I keep messing them up because I won't let them dry all the way before I put my shoes back on. I wish my boyfriend would hurry up and come home at work no actually I am glad that he is working , he needs the money. our three year anniversary is coming up and I have nothing to get him, no idea whatsoever and neither of us have the money to do anything really special so I don't know exactly how this is going to work this year. man I wish I could get motivated to learn that chemistry stuff but I already feel so behind that it makes me discouraged to even try now. I know I will try but I just don't know I just wish that I knew what was going on in there. I was so good at it in high school and that was back in 00th grade and I remember some stuff that he has talked about but not hardly most of it and now I feel behind like I am not going to be able to catch up. I wish that it was not in such a big room I think that is part of my problem, I am not getting the basic review that I need to refresh my memory form so long ago but I guess that is partly my fault, I should be reading, and I am going to as soon as I can motivate myself and tell myself that I can do it and that I am good at it and that I do have a future being good at something. 
__label__label0 I just failed my chemistry quiz. I feel . depressed?  I could have gotten the correct answer it was just that I was answering the question incorrectly. At first I thought it was the LOCNAME's fault, maybe she done the test wrong. But as I was turning in the quiz I finally realized that I had been solving for the wrong question. Hey there's a squirrel with a piece of pizza that is bigger than him !! Ha-ha, cute. Anyways, I was turning in the quiz when I realized this. Oh well it was too late anyways. I wonder if that's how it feels when you die and go to heaven and actually realize you were praying for the wrong person or to no one at all. Just a waste of time. There's a lot of people around here, thank you the group of people that came up with wireless internet. There's really nothing much going around in my mind right now, except for the whole feeling guilty/depressed for failing that chem quiz. I went to the HPO to pick up the application for the JAMP program they want at least a 0. 00 gpa and 0. 0 gpa in the science areas in order to be admitted into it. I already failed my chem quiz , what to do. I have a test next week in chemistry, hopefully I will learn from my previous mistakes in my quiz and I will get an A . PROPNAME, squirrels they are so funny and cute, they are everywhere around this campus, that's what I love about it here, the whole not so dirty as LOCNAME thing going on . Its so clean , well around here it is still haven't seen the rest of LOCNAME. I bet squirrels back at home wouldn't even come up this close as the ones in here do,  What is love. I have been thinking about that , I want to believe my practical side and think that it is nothing but a bunch of hormones hitting your pleasure area in the brain. Or that love is just conformity, you find someone stay with them because you never want to be alone again. Or is love really something else, do we stay alive for it?  Is it really forever even after you die?  Maybe that's just something we want to believe in because we are also afraid of being alone even after we die. Do we really need love to be happy?  I mean love as in an "only one" your significant other, do we really need that kind of love to be happy in life , or is it really just another experience we go through?  What is love to women?  Are they just trying to find another paternal figure in their life in order to replace the one they had when they were young?  I mean think about it, if a girl had a bad experience with her dad, she'd view all men the same. So lets say she lost her respect for him, we'll she then lose respect for all men? Will she be able to be in a healthy relationship?  All these questions, and I can't type fast. I'm a slow typer. But yeah, why are we here anyways. Is life nothing but insignificant events that happen in no random order and were really just nothing at all. I mean I'm sure if all of humanity died, the earth would still spin, maybe the earth will be better with out all of us. Sometimes we think we are the center of the universe. But really we are nothing at all, just a speck in the abyss of the dark universe. Ew, there was some stuff on my hands where did it come from. Maybe a bird pooped on me, you can't trust those birds. I rubbed it all over my forehead, maybe I should check what it is, wait I have to finish this thing. I'm thinking about majoring in some other field now, like psychology, but I love my current HAHAHAHA there is a squirrel in the trash can !! HOW CUTE. So psychology sounds interesting buy I also looooooooove biology. Maybe there's a biopsychology major out there, I mean biology and psychology do go in hand right? 
__label__label1 Right now I'm feeling overwhelmed at all the work that has been given to me. There is so much reading that I have to get done and so little time with all the classes I am taking. Right now I am thinking of a way to manage my time and get everything done. Right now I am hearing dead silence as my roommates and I are all studying in the same room. I am also hearing the fan and the doors slam from others people who are down the hall from me. Right now I am feeling very tired and my eyes are about to shut but I'm trying my best to stay awake. As I type, I'm thinking about other work that needs to be done by tomorrow and wondering if I'm ever going to get that done tonight. At this instant I'm noticing how  there are so many pictures of friends in front of me and how much I miss them. I'm wondering about how tomorrow's classes are going to be and what other will be assigned for that day. I am also thinking about how hard my classes are and how I am going to pass them. I'm trying to figure out a way to manage my time, a way to prevent me from procrastinate, and a way to stay in control with my study habits. Right now I also feel sad because I really miss my family. It's so hard for me to be away from them because I'm so close to them. I especially miss my little bother and little sister. They always make me laugh. Today my day was tough. I hardly understood what was going on in there so I had to stay after class and ask questions. As for my critical thinking seminar, I had a hard time participating mainly because of what the topic was about. Right now I'm hearing no noise at all and it's just making me tired. I feel very cold right now because the fan is right in front of me and it's making my eyes dry.         
__label__label1 there is so much going on my room right now, some it probably isn't the best time to be writing right now well I guess it'll give them more to think about. There is this song on rt now I think its called legionaries its cool it makes me think of like knights and stuff, its kinds up-beat and fun my roommate is talking to her dad about her palm pilot. I love the way he said boulevard its like the greatest British accent. I've been to LOCNAME well I mean LOCNAME. Either way I want to have a friend who is British like a guy friend I guess because I don't think id want to date a British guy, they all have gross teeth, I don't really understand that like do they not go to the dentist or know what a toothbrush is or something. Oh I don't think I've ever seen a British person with braces either I guess it has to be something to do with the dentist. I just changed the song on my cd player, the song was called Clementine which reminds me of my favorite movie, well one of my favorite movies, I have like a ton of favorite things, they are never ending. I'm always like yeah this is my fav song or this is my fav band, and the person I am talking to will be like wait I  thought you said that blah blah was your fav band, and then I'm like well yeah them too. Well anyway one of my fav movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, its so weird but you know those are fav type of movies, I don't think I have a fav that everyone else like and I don't so it on purpose to be diff or anything oh and by the way I absolutely can't stand those type of people who feel that they have to be diff so they do stuff so blatantly different just so that they will be the center of attention, drives me nuts, like people who dye their hair like crazy colors or people who wear weird like way out there kind of clothes, and I bet is you were to ask them why their hair looks like that or why they're wearing that they'll just tell you. I've lost my train of thought, what I was going to say wasn't really going to make any sense. My roommate uses her palm pilot for everything, I don't know if I could deal using one of those for everything, I couldn't live without my comp, but my cell phone has a lot of the options that palm pilots do like a calendar and alarms a phone book so whatever. I think I should get my blood sugar measured, because I think since I have been at college all I do now is eat, and not healthy foods, I have to have something sweet all the time, it is kind of showing on my figure. I was just thinking about how I looked in a leotard today in my ballet class, I'm not as comfortable being in one as I used to be. Oh this girl in ballet class had just done some center combo with me and we were waiting for everyone else to go and she was like are you gong to try out for the dance team? and I was like no but I think I want to try out for the steel dance company and she was like oh aren't tryouts this weekend? and I was like yeah and she was like oh you will do great you're really really good, I was happy to hear her say that, just to have someone compliment me on my dance skills is such a boost of self esteem especially before tryouts this weekend, I got back to my dorm room and I was so happy, that can also be because I talked to PROPNAME rt after my class, we are really doing well I think after this weekend, things have steadily been getting back on track with us, I really think I am in love with him, I think the whole break up only made us stronger, that happened the first time we sort of broke up, I wish we could just spend all of our time with each other, I really do miss him a lot, and the thing is if we hadn't broken up this summer I wanted to break up with him before we started college because I wanted to date other people, but the truth is I've only been comparing other guys to him, I guess that's what happens, I mean I have seen cute guys but I haven't really met any yet, so I don't know if that's a good ting or not, anyway PROPNAME wanted to make it official that we were back together last weekend but its hard because I can't really trust him and neither can my parents, so that really sucks because I really do still want to be with him but my mom is like LOCNAME your a fool and blah blah and sometimes I feel like I kind of am because I start to doubt myself so much about the decision I'm making about us, its like would I follow my heart or mind? it sounds like a stupid line out of a movie but that's really how I feel, I think things are looking up and I think my hearts motives are starting to blend with my mind's  
__label__label1 It's only the second week of school, actually the first full week and I'm already so stressed out from studying. I'm not sure exactly how to study but I'm learning. I think maybe I should just make study guides so that's what I'm doing. Oh my gosh, I got to eat at the nicest restaurant last night, TrueLuck's. It was so good and I had such a good time. This past Saturday I wanted to go home so bad and was trying to get my boyfriend to come meet me in LOCNAME to eat. It didn't happen but in the long run I'm glad because I finally made some friends. I'm the kind of person who likes to have a lot of friends to hang out with and usually they are mostly guys. Though this doesn't much help my boyfriend's peace of mind. I'm not sure my roommate is that way but whatever. Anyway, well I met these really cool guys who I really like hanging out with. Sometimes I don't think PROPNAME likes them as much and it pisses me off because it makes me feel like she thinks I'm wrong to hang with guys because I have a boyfriend and so does she and well we're just really different. Well these guys ended up needing dates to a dinner for their fraternity so we said we'd go, I think PROPNAME only said yes because she had been drinking. Well I had so much fun and the guy I went with turned out to be really nice. It was great to finally go out and do something with people. I feel more at home now. Now to my boyfriend. We were best friends for 0 years before we even thought about dating. I love him so much and although I'm only 00 I pretty much believe he's the guy I'm suppose to be with when I get married. But my going away to college has been hard on both of us and in some ways harder on him. I understand that he's back home and doing the same things he's done for 0 years so he doesn't have as many things to keep his mind of missing me as I do but before we never argued and now he's always mad at me about something. He makes me feel awful when I go out and I know he doesn't mean to but it happens. He can't understand where I'm coming from. The guy I dated never cried every night and now he does and it gets depressing and makes me feel guilty. I want to have fun here without knowing that he's at home mad or crying. He's not the crying type of guy so I just don't understand. I love him more than anything and he should realize that, that is all that matters. No other guy here will ever take his place but that doesn't mean that I won't make other guy friends and go out with them. I don't even look at guys the same way because of Brent. My life here does not mean that what I feel in my heart is suddenly going to change. I just wish that he would go back to being the same Brent as before I left but I know that it is going to take time and I just need to realize this just as much as he needs to realize how bad he's making me feel. It's a compromise situation but I think everyone should have to go through this because if we're still together in the long run I know our relationship will be just that much stronger. I'm going home this weekend and I can't wait finally I can show Brent that my feelings for him are the same and I get to see my mom and sister. I have to go to my dad's and since he just moved out a few weeks ago it will be my first time to go and I'm not really looking forward to it. I want things to go back to normal with my family. The way it's suppose to be. If there is such a thing. The months before coming to college were so hard and stressful that at times I'm glad I'm here and away from all of it. At least I don't have to listen to the screaming and fighting. I wish my mom would try to fight for my dad and like lose weight or something. But she's being stupid. I miss my sister so much and my dog Tinker. My sister and I are so close we might as well be twins so I hate being away from her. 
__label__label0 I feel so blessed to be here right now. the game tonight was so fun. I can't believe that we won 00-0. that's such an incredible win. poor north LOCNAME guys. They must feel pretty embarrassed. I feel so content here and settled even though I've only been here a couple of weeks. I think that I am really getting comfortable with all of my classes and the people around me and am really getting to feel like this is my home. I miss judd so much. the time we get to spend together is never enough. its funny to me how I haven't missed my parents at all but I think about and miss judd all the time. I just love the way he makes me feel, so warm and so complete. I'm so glad that I have friends here like oshley and that I totally lucked out with allyson as my roommate. I'm so relieved that me and my friend ben worked out the awkwardness between us so that we're still good friends. I was so surprised when I saw him on the jumbotron tonight. I feel so proud of him. I can't stop thinking about how lucky I feel to be here. I just love it here and can't wait till judd gets here. I think I want to convince all my friends still in high school to go to school here. Its just so amazing. the people and the opportunities and the culture make this place so amazing. living in new braunfels was such a bubble. this feels more like the real world. I know that people say college is still a bubble and I think they're right, but its more of a realistic world than life in new braunfels. I miss high school, but just the idea of knowing everybody and where everything was and the comfort of it being my hometown. at the game last night, I felt a little sad that I wasn't down there on the track cheering. now that judd and I were together, part of me wishes I could go back and have that ultimately typical high school relationship - the varsity football player and the varsity cheerleader. it would've been so much fun to have that sort of experience!  I'm just a little jealous of those girls down there on the track because I feel like they aren't taking advantage of what an incredible opportunity they've got down there. those were the best times of my life thus far. I know that better are sure to come in my years here at LOCNAME, but I just wish that I could go back, just for one Friday night, and cheer under the lights and yell for the boys and be right down there with judd. it makes me so sad that I probably won't ever get to perform like that again. my dancing and cheering days are over and I just want them back. its not that I miss the actual belonging to the cheerleading program, I just miss being in the spotlight and performing for the fans. I thrive off of that and now I feel a little empty since I don't get to do it anymore, and I especially feel it when I see the new girls down there on the track. I feel kind of dumb reminiscing so much on high school memories now that I'm in college because all I ever talked about in high school was how I couldn't wait to get away from the drama and just come to college to be just a normal student. granted I definitely don't miss the drama of high school, I do miss the girls and the games of high school cheerleading.  the more I keep thinking about this the more sad I feel. I think the biggest problem is how much I miss judd. we spent so much time together this summer and I just miss him not always being there to hold whenever and wherever I needed him. I can't believe I fell in love with him. he's just an amazing guy. the one thing that scares me about him that makes me feel nervous is his uncertainty about his Christianity. its so hard for me to explain my faith to him because it was just engrained in me and I was too young to question it and now its just a part of who I am and I'm so thankful for that. but judd didn't grow up going to church or with any faith instilled in him so now its hard for him to understand or trust anything that he can't prove really is there. I think its a matter of pride. The idea of giving himself to someone else that he doesn't really know is there doesn't settle well with him. or maybe its a trust issue. Or maybe both. its just hard because I can't really understand how he can NOT have belief, and he doesn't understand how I CAN. oh man I have a lot of homework this weekend. I really have to finish it all tomorrow so I can go home and see judd. I can't wait to see him tomorrow. I wish he could be up here experiencing all this with me. I can't wait for him to come to school up here and be with me! that will totally complete me here. I don't know if I'm complete without him. I've never felt dependent on someone like that before. well I think my time is almost up. in conclusion, I feel so amazed that I'm actually here. I miss my friends who aren't here, and I especially miss judd. I want to work hard here and prove myself to everyone and make really good grades and fully experience everything ut has to offer. 
__label__label1 Well where should I start. First of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that I have ever had to do. I'm not even sure what to write about. My day started at 0:00 today because I have an 0 o'clock class which is really fun. not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less. then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun. then I had a break from 00 to 0:00 which would really suck if I didn't have plans. so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I'm flag football team. well anyway, I'm not even sure if I'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today. any way I really enjoyed today's material in class. at first I wasn't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now. Considering that I have and extremely hot instructor for my ORGNAME 000 class. Its crazy hot attractive she is. But now I'm thinking about another girl that I have a crush on. Today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates. I'm not sure if she knows how I feel, but I'm having a hard time reading her. Usually I'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier. I also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because I had been wanting to talk to them for a while. Things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes. I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind. On yeah, I got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad. My dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work. My mom called on her way to a Bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl I have crush on this weekend since she is going home Friday. anyway crush is such a high school word now, what I really meant was girl I'm attracted to. What's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since I was in 00th grade. and every time she would tell me I would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that I'm into her it kind of sucks because now I have to put much more effort into it. Now don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to make it seem like I'm am lazy but I truly am not used to putting in so much work. I know it may sound cockeye but if it does I'm sorry, please don't think of me like that. what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or I'll type and you'll read later. 
__label__label1 Today has not been a very good day for me. I found out that my roommate is secretly dating my ex-boyfriend behind my back. My friend and I caught them together last night in the courtyard outside of my dorm. This is one of the worst feeling I have ever felt. I am dating a boy right now, but  the feelings for my ex have started to resurface. She fully knows that I like him, but she is deceiving me. I was very irritable today and I was rude to a lot of people. I really am not a rude person, I just do not understand why people find it necessary to take advantage of my niceness. I went to PROPNAME's last night to pick up some to go food. It is sitting in my refrigerator and I am very anxious to eat it. I already had some chips, salsa, queso, and guacamole today. I love Mexican food. I have a French test tomorrow. This is our second test. I thought I made an A on the last test, but when I got it back I found a much lower grade. It upset me, so I am going to study very hard for this test. Right now I have a 0. 0 at the university, and I want to keep it as close to that as possible. I have noticed while typing this that I never capitalize 'I'. I have gone back and fixed my work at least ten times. I am used to typing informally online, where grammar and capitalization does not matter. My roommate just left for an environmentalist meeting, and I wanted to go read some of her AIM logs. So, I walked over to her computer and was starting to read some when the door started to shake and I thought I heard  her key in the door. I was so scared that she was going to come in and catch me. From that experience I have realized that I don't want to be snooping in her stuff anymore. It would not be worth it if she came in and caught me. We already are going to be on semi-bad terms after I talk to her tonight about PROPNAME. One of our good friends thinks that once I talk to her about it she will drop the whole thing. He said that she felt really bad about going behind my back and she knew it was "too good to be true". Oh come on. She met him like three days ago, there is no way she likes him that much. It just hurts me so bad to know that she ignores our friendship  and goes after something that she knows will hurt me. Last night our friend talked to her about it and told her that she needed to drop it or else neither of us would talk to her. She told him that she was not sure what she wanted to do because PROPNAME is "special". That is what got to me the most. She is willing to throw away two friendships for a boy she just met like 0 days ago. I am already stressed out enough with school, I do not need roommate problems. This is the reason I do not hang out with girls, they do this sort of thing to each other. My guy friends have never hurt me intentionally like this. When they try to get to me, they use force. Like one time my guy friends all attacked me with pillows. It got frustrating, but I did not get emotionally hurt by it. Girls get you in the worst possible way. Tonight Mean Girls is showing at the Union. I want to go see it so bad because I love that movie. It is so good. I would go see it if I did not have to do all of this homework. I already had a test last week in French, I am upset that there is another one this week. Our teacher also assigns us homework on the night before our test. It is safe to say that we are going to be studying for the test, so there is no need to assign homework. Oh well. I have not done laundry since I arrived here in LOCNAME. I am down to my last pants and shorts. I will probably do some tonight, if I don't get too lazy. I have treated this writing assignment as like a journal. I have a lot of stuff on my mind from this whole roommate thing, so it is good that I could write it all out. It has been kind of hard to keep writing constantly. My hand are getting kind of numb. I think it is because I never use the shift key to capitalize things, and now I have to. Well, my time has come to an end. Time to get back to more homework. 
__label__label0 Okay, I am writing this thing called stream ORGNAME consciousness writing. I find it hard to type right now. I don't know if I should follow proper grammar. My PROPNAME firewall just detected another blocked intrusion. I don't like this. Annoying hackers. Why don't they just go one with their lives without bothering decent people like me. I have 0 roommates and they are all good except for one. He is nice and all but he does have annoying habits and it seems he does not know proper manners. He watches TV loudly even though he knows people are trying to sleep. He even woke me up listening to music using my own computer without asking my permission to use it. That is so annoying and I can't stand it right now. My goodness, it has only been 0 mins? I've been writing a lot of things already. My arms are hurting because I can't type for so long and I hate typing. I'm not a typer, my brother and cousin are flawless typers but I am not. I already had so many errors in typing right now it is so annoying me. I want to destroy this key board. I want to use the voice typing method but even that is a pathetic technology which is still in its infancy. This is really annoying me. I want to take the psych research right now but I can't because I am not 00 yet. That is a load of bullshit if u ask me. can't it be 00? What is your advantage to your peers in the same batch or class who are older than you by a few months?? A few months of extra knowledge??? I don't think so. I hate my birthday, there is also a math midterm on my birthday, hooray for me. how nice, what a nice birthday gift. I have a tendency to measure how much I type. I always limit myself and not going to much bec. I always fear my efforts are being wasted or something and I am very lazy so I will rather do nothing or stop doing something if there is no punishment involved. Like this writing assignment right now, if this was not graded or the lose of not doing this is very minimal, I will just stop and just receive the consequences rather than waste 00 minutes of my time doing nothing but write, senseless writing. And I ate writing, I hate the damn typo errors, I hate now typing fluidly like others, I hate making mistakes, I hate typing because it hurts my hands and fingers! I hate this activity. I am not in a very good mood right now, I kind of understand that, I wonder why? Is it my roommate? maybe, is it this senseless activity? maybe. maybe its because ORGNAME of ORGNAME has cut my freaking internet, no I can't download beyond 0 gigs. nooo bec. u are taking up too much bandwidth and leaving none for the others. What do I say? I say to hell with the others, what do they care if they don't really use the internet in the first place. They are just wasting bandwidth on nothing. This is just pathetic. You guys are afraid of the recording companies, the ORGNAME or something like that. That's what you are. Afraid. Why don't you just leave us alone like other schools? They have FREE internet, not this cheap limited "u have to pay" for internet. I am just ranting away all my frustrations on this thing aren't I? I hope no one reads it, if u do. the hell do I care! Damn it. College life sucks. To much reading. Everyone expects you to read all the chapters and expect you to understand the next day during the lecture. Well, tough luck, we are not that smart. Some people do well in lectures and some do well with books. Some people just can understand with the book so why do u pick on us?? Everything you test should be on your lectures. The book is just for bringing your knowledge of the subject to a more concrete manner. Lectures are what really is important, and you just read the book to review. You don't test what u do not teach in lectures!! Thank God I only have a few more minutes left. My fingers are burning now. I cannot be stuck doing the same thing for prolonged periods of time. It is just not right. It is so boring. Funny though. if u come to think of it. Ironic. I cannot stand doing a same thing for so long but I can stand doing nothing for so long. What kind of person am I? Indolent. Lazy. Pathetic. That's what I am. A person who does not want to leave his little protective sphere. a controlled sphere. I am afraid to do things with risks, I will never succeed in life like that. Doomed not to be a leader. 
__label__label1 This past weekend I took a short journey back to my home city of LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. I went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell I'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. The dorm itself I like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that I can feel as though I am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. This semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. However, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that I got much accomplished. I got much of my studying done and I finally got my book situation in order. At first when I went to the Co-op I bought all these different books for each of the classes I am taking and then I came to discover that I didn't need about three of them. So then I had to make time to go back and return the books that I no longer needed, and I had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. This weekend I also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but I still managed to have a great time. I bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. The day after the game when I went back to LOCNAME LOCNAME I got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. He is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. I was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but I will see him every now and then when I get a chance to journey back home. I also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. We went out to eat and to see a movie. We weren't sure what movie to see so I thought I would let her pick because of the nice that I am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. He immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. In the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. I can't wait for winter time. It is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and I go skiing in LOCNAME - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. One of the worst times I've ever had there is when I wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and I jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and I smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. All together I would have to say that I'm very excited about this year, and I can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life. 
__label__label1 College isn't at all what I thought it was going to be. MAN, that French class is really kicking my but right now!!  But, I'm determined to suck it up and get through it with a decent grade!!  I feel so insignificant compared to PROPNAME, he probably has no idea what it feels like to feel so behind everyone else!  But of coarse, I would never let on to that around him. I really can't wait till I finish this semester and maybe next semester I will have a better experience. I really think that 00 hrs for a freshman is a little too much, especially for me. I really feel like I cheated someone out of a spot well earned here at LOCNAME. I don't feel like I'm smart enough to be here. But I'm sure that I'm not the only person that had those thoughts every now and then. I really just hope I can keep a b avg so I can keep that scholarship!!!  I should probably make French a pass/fail class. I'm just so jealous of people that catch on to language so quickly and leave students like me in the dust!!  Ah. I should just be glad that I have the opportunity to explore myself here instead of griping about it 00/0. And MOM!!!  she can't keep her mouth shut. If I wanted PROPNAME to know I wasn't feeling very confident then I would have told him!!!!  But of coarse, he calls and says, "mom said you couldn't handle your FR class. Well, just remember that school is your job!"  I know JOHN!!!!!!!!!!!  he just doesn't understand that I have too much pride in me to admit that, yeah, I was crying to mom that I really didn't know if I could keep up in French!  I hate it when he sees that "failing" side of me. I want to be as invincible as he is. And that's impossible. I can't live up to his example!!  There's no way I'll graduate first in my class here at LOCNAME like he did and get some awesome job in new York that pays more money than I've ever seen at once!!!  It sux having a brother that had scholarships that paid all of his college expenses with money still left over!!!!!  He amazes me. Maybe that's my problem is I'm trying too hard and wasting all my energy to impress him!  Its not Mom, I know she just wants these years to be the best years of my life, but john wants them to be my JOB!!!!!!  What the hell!!!!  Can I not have a normal family that just is happy and supportive of me and understands that I am an individual that will do and accomplish different things than they ever did in different ways than they ever thought of!!!  Maybe ORGNAME's not for me. Maybe I'm meant to be at some rinkydink community college, where not that much is expected of me!!  But no. That's not me. There's just something in me that won't let me settle on average         
__label__label0 Well, I today I'm feeling pretty lovely. I woke up this morning and went to the gym. Afterwards I took a shower and went downstairs to get something to eat. I met up with this boy I am talking to, he's really sweet and sexy. He makes me feel special. But I'm being very cautious in this little relationship, because I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve, and I don't feel like getting hurt. Anyways,  my sandwich was really good. I'm also watching Seinfeld right now. Actually if you want to be technical with it, I'm not watching it because I'm typing right now, but it's on in the background. But yah, I love Seinfeld. I think it's the greatest show in the world. I am still amazed at how someone can write a nine season show about NOTHING. That's crazy. You know what else I think is crazy?  I don't know how in world I'm going to manage my time between classes and work-study and the gym and my social life. It's like there is so much to do. Especially with all this reading I have to do for psy. Now that's crazy!  Why do we have to read so much. Why can't the teacher just teach it to us. Maybe I'm just being lazy. Who knows?  Yes! Another episode of Seinfeld is coming on. Anyways, on Monday there's a Seinfeld marathon. It starts at 0am until the end of Labor Day. That is really cool. I can't wait. But yah. I wonder what grade I'm going to get in this class. I've done all my experiments. I be damned if I had to write some 0 page psychological paper. So you know I got started on those experiments ASAP. Okay! Anyways, I really don't know what else to write about. So lets see. let me think. What else can I talk about. Oh yeah! There's a football game tonight. I hope we win. I wish I could go, but I didn't but any tickets. I don't even know where to buy tickets from. I should of just got a sports package. That would of made my life a whole lot easier. I have this football player in my class. Actually he's in two of my classes. He's nice. We study together, because our rhetoric class is kind of difficult, and he's always falling asleep in class. I don't blame him. They work those football players really hard. A little bit too hard. That's just ridiculous. Sometimes I feel for them, because like how do they expect them to do good in school, when there only getting like 0hrs of sleep a day. That's not good, especially with all that strenuous activity they do. I know I wouldn't be able to do it. I know after I come back from the gym, I'm ready to go back to sleep. So I really feel for the football players. But I guess if you really want to make it to the ORGNAME, you got do it. You got to stick with it. And that really goes for anything. If you want to accomplish any of your goals, then you have to stick with the game plan. Anyway, you know it really hasn't hit me that I am in college yet. I mean it kind of hit me last week, when I was going out with some of my friends. And it was like, I don't have to call my mom and tell her what I'm doing, I don't have to worry about her sending out a search party for me. I don't have to answer to nobody. It's so great. I love this!  Anyway, the way I see it if I just find out some way to manage my time with work, gym, classes, and my social life then everything should just work out fine. Yah in a perfect world. Anyways, looks like I got about 0 more minutes to right. Okay lets, see. You know what my favorite episode of Seinfeld is?  The very first episode, when PROPNAME and PROPNAME where doing laundry. That's a really good episode. I know like every word, scene, move. everything about that episode. Anyways, looks like I'm going on only two minutes left. Two minutes and forty seconds. Two minutes and 00 seconds. Two minutes and 00 seconds. Two minutes and 00 seconds. Two minutes and now we have ONE MINUTE LEFT. All right I'm on a roll here. Lets see, I guess I'll just sign off now. Well this has been really fun. I hope whoever is reading this has enjoyed reading this. Have a great day and a great like. 0 seconds left . and GOOD BYE! 
__label__label0 Wow, Its the end of another week ,and finally I get time to relax . My idea of relaxing isn't partying or drinking. My idea of relaxing is sleeping. Yes sleeping for long hours with nothing on my mind, is my favorite hobby. My roommate is reading what I'm reading so I had to halt before I continued typing. There's another friend in my room and he's laughing at what I just wrote. He shouldn't be reading other people's thoughts! Wow 0 minutes over already. I got 00 minutes left . I'm just feeling really light right now. Light in the head. I can't think of anything to write. This is supposed to be a spontaneous writing assignment. It's definitely better than the other assignments where you have to prepare drafts and correct mistakes over and over again. Tomorrow's Saturday and Saturday means another football game for UT. I couldn't go for the first game, because I didn't have the football package and the tickets cost a lot out of the package. My roommate is making me listen to one of her songs right now. So basically I'm doing two things at a time-typing and listening to music. Some people can study with music playing, I still haven't tried studying with music playing in the background. Maybe I should try it out sometime. I think it is important to knock before you enter a room. But that just doesn't happen in Jester. One of my friends just barged in, and I jumped in my seat. This is crazy. I should tell him not to do that again. I'm not that fastidious actually. But certain things annoy me. The things that would annoy me would actually annoy any normal human being, so I know I'm not a freak. I have to call my mom tonight and tell her about the week's events. It's been a great week. My chemistry test went well. I really want to maintain high grades throughout the semester, so I can get some kind of scholarship. I don't want my father to pay so much for my education. He doesn't grumble or anything, but I just feel guilty. I know that I have to work extra hard because I have been given a wonderful opportunity to study in a great school like Stand I must make good use of this advantage I have over other people. I'm loving it here. I came to LOCNAME exactly a month ago. Wow I should be celebrating today. It's been a month in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. This stupid friend is irritating me, Wish I could ask him to leave, I can't concentrate on my thoughts. He's asking me why I type with just two fingers. God. I'm going to tell him to mind his own business. I better change the topic . Or he might read this ,and get annoyed and abuse me or something. Yeah but making friends has been tough. I haven't made too many friends. My roommate is my best friend  as of now. I couldn't have asked for a better roommate. We just get along really well. Today at Chemistry class I met another Indian girl. She was from LOCNAME . She was basically an ORGNAME -American born confused Desk. Desk refers to Indians Ok my 00 minutes are up so I'm going to sign off now. I'm going shopping with my friend PROPNAME, right now. I'm going to the Target store. Then I've got to come back and do my laundry. Ok. I'm going. Bye. Writing this assignment has been great. Thank You 
__label__label1 Hi, I'm sitting here in the computer lab at the ORGNAME, and it is dark outside and I'm a young attractive female. . I'll definitely need an escort when it's time to go home. Home, that's what I call my dorm these days. it's just easier for me. I want to have some established place to live and stuff that way I'll be more plugged in to the university lifestyle. I used to laugh at LT when she called her dorm home. I guess I am following in her footsteps. although her strides are quite different from mine. and talking of strides, I miss cross country and all the guys. it was so much fun. I enjoyed every moment of it without even knowing it. I wish I could rewind back to those days when everything was so nice, so quarantined and all the laws of nature followed as they should. what went up came down and so on. I wish I could just see the fruit of my hard work as I did in cross country. the family atmosphere that I ridiculed and even took for granted at times. how could I have been so? I who loves others, I who cherishes all my friends. they were all my friends, all 00 of them. some more than others, but we all had that common goal that I find characterizes friendships. we were a sister hood. gosh, what a mourner I am, lamenting over the past. but they were good times. I'm sure, and I hope to God that I'll have some more good times or even better than ever times still to come. but this I can only hope that God gives me. For who knows tomorrow may never be. perhaps this is all I have. I'm not afraid though, just not prepared to meet my maker yet. I don't think I've done what I was purposed to do. therefore I'm not ready to go yet. in fact,,, I don't even know what it is that I was purposed to do. perhaps it is not a single great thing, perhaps it is just all those little things that I should be doing that I was purposed to do. who knows?  who cares but me and my maker?  Anyway, I guess that's life, not figuring out what one was purposed to do but just doing it. I guess it just comes naturally as all things in life do. I don't think planning is such a great idea. I don't think MLK planned to lead the civil rights movement when he was a freshman in college. I guess the civil rights found him and appointed him leader. or so I guess. and whatever it is that I'll need to do will find me and use me for what I am worth. when put that way, it sounds almost prostitution. but it cannot be. mankind is not a prostitute race. or is it. I don't know. sometimes I think it is . other times I think it is a dignified race. but then again to think mankind a dignified race is to give it too much adoration. too much more than it deserves. Mankind is a fallen race. lower than the angles -which we should have been higher than. but then again mankind is a dignified race made in the image of God with the ability to tap into the supernatural/the unknown unlike any other creature. There is no intelligent life in other planets, we are it. Now, I don't mean to say there is no other life forms out there, but that it is not more intelligent or even as intelligent as mankind. but then again what do I know? I who was born only 00 years ago?  I don't know much, but then again, I have know a lot more than I credit myself. I have the ability to tap into the fountain of knowledge that never runs dry. there are things, great mysteries, that I knew even before I was born. but how is this?. oops my 00 minutes are up and that popup really disrupted my stream of consciousness!!!!  what an ass! 
__label__label0 well I'm sitting in the library doing the writing assignment for psychology class. This is really fun. I just finished writing down my notes for astronomy class because I have a quiz in there on Thursday. I went home this past weekend. Nothing really exciting happened. I visited with my family for memorial day. My cousin was nominated for homecoming queen. Wow. Not. Anyway yeah. I'm back now. It was weird having to pack to go home. I saw a movie over the weekend, wicker park was the name of it. It was really good. I thought that it wasn't going to be that good but I really liked it, it was a love story and I'm always a sucker for those. well the time is going by really slowly. I want to get back to my room so I can watch my favorite TV show of all time. Big brother. it's almost over so it's getting exciting. I don't think I spelled that right. O well. This is the easiest assignment I think that I've ever been assigned. Wow. 00 min is a really long time. I still have 00 more minutes to go. ummm. I've been in the library a really long time. And I still need to finish the pre-screening survey for this class so I can get experiment credit. I'm really tired. My friend PROPNAME is sitting next to me. She already did the assignment. I wish I was in my bed right now. I'm always tired these days. I'm liking college so far. I miss home sometimes and it seems like I miss it at the weirdest times but I think I'm adjusting pretty well. At least I think so. I left my medicine at home so I'm having trouble breathing. But my mom is sending it to me so I can feel better soon. I have to go to a ORGNAME football game for an assignment in my freshman seminar class but I didn't buy a sports package which by the way I think is the stupidest think I've ever heard of. I think if you're a student then you should be able to get into the game for free but what do I know. Anyway so I need to find somebody with an extra ticket that they want to give me. um I like all my professors except my freshman seminar prof. He picks on me because I'm quiet and I don't talk much. I hate when teachers do that. It really bugs me . I like listening to people talk. O man I still have 0 min to go. Blah blah. um a little while ago this guy was sitting next to me and he kept farting. It smelt so bad. Luckily he left because I don't think I would have been able to take it much longer. well now I can't think of anything to write so maybe I'll sing a song. "on Monday I'm waiting, Tuesday I'm fading and by Wednesday I can't sleep. Then the phone rings I hear you and the darkness is a clear view because you've come to rescue me". That was PROPNAME PROPNAME. I like her because she has the same name as me even though she doesn't spell it the right way. That's ok I guess I can forgive her. I like her sister, PROPNAME, too even if she is a dumb blond sometimes but at least she's herself unlike so many other people I know that try to copy what other people do and they can't come up with a unique thought if their live depended on it. Well I only have 0 minutes left. Thank goodness. It seems like I've been typing forever. Well my hand are getting tired of typing and I keep misspelling stuff so I have to keep on pressing the backspace button and I'm really tired. I've already said that but that's all I can think of right now. My eyes keep wanting to close. Good only one more minute and then I'm going to go and take a nap. O wait I can't. I have too much reading to do. That's all I do these days is read, read, read, and then I read some more. bye         
__label__label0 It seems like everyone has gone home for Labor Day weekend. Lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good. We had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. I really don't normally like mashed potatoes but I always just get them anyway. A couple people started playing Coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key. Procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class. The more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be. This dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us. At night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance. They tend to yell and be extremely loud. Our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow. It would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off. There are so many more months before the semester is over!  I'm sure it will go quickly though. Twenty minutes seems like a long time right now. I still have to go to ORGNAME today because we're completely out of snacks in the room. I'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me. Our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch. I've been watching way too much of "The Real World" in the past two days. They've been playing reruns nonstop since like Wednesday. This week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because Monday and Wednesday are my busy days. I want to get out of the city next weekend. Maybe I'll go visit some friends at LOCNAME LOCNAME or go to the lake. I haven't been swimming in really long time. I remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than I remember swimming in my own pool. Maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time. Our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make. The trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but I never once got stung. The lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out. Well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because I'm over half way done. The game on Saturday was really fun. Once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable. ORGNAME didn't do very well. I almost went there instead of LOCNAME just because its close to home and my sisters went there. On the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home. I don't know why I bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when I have a computer sitting right in front of me. Its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book. I hear a lawnmower outside. I feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on Labor Day. My neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long. I should trim my fingernails. They keep getting in the way while I'm typing. I haven't seem a movie since I came to Austin. I don't even know where a movie theater is around here. Better yet, I don't know what is playing right now. I haven't seen any previews either. Someone must be sick because I keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway. People go out way too much. I can't go out on a school night without feeling badly. I always want to wait for the weekend. I'm sure that will change shortly though. This has been a very long weekend. I  think I'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.      
__label__label1      So it is cold in my room it was like that last night too. I really have to go to the bathroom. wow I suck at typing I think it is because my fingers are cold. my feet are also cold too. I can hear the air conditioning blowing over my bed and my room. I'm so full right now-I just had lunch and it was good, but I was starving. Absolutely starting. I have this class today and I hope I don't fall asleep. I don't think I will because it is usually entertaining. I hope I am doing this right. Since I am typing, I am focusing on that and not on my main stream thoughts. I hope my friend PROPNAME is doing ok, she doesn't like her roommate and wants to transfer to LOCNAME where her brother goes to school. I can picture her sitting in her dorm all alone right now. PROPNAME is funny. we usually eat lunch together and it is fun. she is quiet and a lot of people might think she was a snob, but she isn't,just shy. TOnight I have a meeting to go to for 0 hours. that sucks. I wonder if my parents are going to come to LOCNAME this weekend. They said they might, but I'm going to the game on Saturday and I won't be in town on Sunday, so I guess we will see. Did I mention I have to pee?  I think I did. I took my ipod to class today, to biology, and listened to it on the way. It worked fine except I kind of felt like a snobby -conspicuous consumption- person while I was listening to my music. The white earpieces give it away. Everyone knows its an Ipod. I always am picturing the bus stop I walk past to get to class. how everyone is standing outside, waiting for the bus, the shadow of the trees' leaves on the ground in the hot August sun. Haha, I feel like I'm writing some romance novel or something. I have a lot of homework to do today, and I didn't do much last night. Now the refrigerator is making noises, but it always does. I think my roommate is at class. I haven't seen her at all today. I wonder what people downstairs are doing. this kid thought I was going to eat lunch with him because we just happened to leave the dorm at the same time to go to PROPNAME, but then I was meeting my friend. So I feel kind of bad, but he went on ahead too. Its not totally my fault. Some of my high school friends are out of school now. I have class till 0 then the ORGNAME meeting till 0. blah. And I have a meeting tomorrow night, and a couple next week. This feels like high school again. I hope people will wait for me to go to dinner with them. Last night we went to jack in the box, and I hate fast food, so I got a salad. That's what I got when we went to ORGNAME ORGNAME last week, also. I would rahter eat at kinsolving then waste my Bevo Bucks there. Mmm. Thai food sounds good. My nutrition class is so boring. Today at lunch while I got my tacos and was fixing them, and while I got my fruit, I was thinking of my nutrition class and our teacher lecturing on and on. About fruits, vegetables, the servings we ned to have of each, that kind of of thing. I'm really tired all the sudden. My eyes are starting to close. I could take a nap before psych. But I probably won't. So I still have to pee. That's kind of gross and you won't want to know that but oh well. All my friends keep signing on to I'M but I can't talk to them because I am doing this. only 00 min. left! This reminds me of jogging on the treadmill at PROPNAME, with other sweating people watching PROPNAME or Regis and Kelly in the morning. I keep looking at the clock, praying the time will go faster so I will be done working out. Should I join crew? I might, my roommate is involved, and it would be a good way to work out, and it would be done so early in the morning. I just hesitate because I don't want to be exhausted all the time, which I could very well be. My friend PROPNAME goes to ORGNAME and he had a fro last year but he shaved it this summer. I like it better with the fro because he is a funny kid. I'm getting tired of this. I don't want Carpel Tunnel Syndrome or anything. I don't think I have actually ever typed for like 00 min at a time. the girl across the hall from me isn't very friendly. She is in my bio and chem classes and in my FIG also, but she seems kind of snobby and all like "I'm too good to talk to you". I keep thinking of my friend from HS who is in the psych class too. I saw her as we walked out on Monday and  I was like oh, hey. I'm thinking about breaking out my Thin Mints that my mom sent me right now. I wanted a cookie at lunch but they had cake. And cookies are so good. FOr some reason PROPNAME just popped into my head. what should I do about that? Should I vote for him?  I think it was because we did a psych. survey yesterday about PROPNAME and terrorism. My fridge stopped making noises but the a. C still is. My arms are starting to hurt. Am I going to die? This weekend my brother and his wife came in town from LOCNAME for a wedding and we hung out with him. We went to LOCNAME LOCNAME, it was fun. After, we got some tacos at this place for lunch. It was good. I can see us in line at the restaurant (as a baby I called it a restoot) waiting to order, me looking around, deciding what to get, if I wanted the drinks that were really good, they taste just like a fruit. We got a cantolope one and it was so refreshing. I have the worst posture. I'm trying to sit up now. My friend kc has a yoga strap she uses to keep her sitting up straight. Owww. my arms really hurt now. oh band, I was in band last year and I remember marching and all those friends I had from band. One of my friends who is a senior now has to go to practice today. He just signed online. Wow, only 0 more minutes!  Someone is slamming doors in my hall and I can hear people talking. There are some really annoying sorority girls and frat boys in my hall and they think they are so cool. One girl has they shorts that say sexy on the butt, and she is also in one of my classes. I'm not a huge fan of her. wow, that's mean. me just rambling on about the people I don't like. Ok, almost there. I feel like I'm running a marathon. I ran this morning. I'm proud of myself for exercising so hopefully I won't gain the freshman 000000. Then you would have to roll me home. I can imagine, rolling myself home past the PROPNAMEs in LOCNAME, the ORGNAME station and the little Beaver (Buccee himself) on the ORGNAME sign. ok I'm done, ow my arms hurt. I'm such a wimp. Now my prof is going to read this out loud and I'm going to be mortified, sinking lower and lower in my seat. please don't read aloud! haha. I know that won't happen. ok bye. 
__label__label1 Well, I'm not exactly sure what to write about. I just finished my prescreening for the Psychology Experiment stuff and I now have to 0. 0 credits for it. So I only have to get 0. 0 more I guess to get the 0. I hope the experiment things aren't anything to bad and they don't take that long. I hate typing when I have rings and bracelets on. I really like to wear jewelry but they just start to hurt me when they rub up against the keyboard holder thingy. I don't know how I'm going to be able to write straight for 00 minutes. I just took my bracelet off, it was really hurting. I have so much homework to do this weekend. I guess teachers (professors) think that since it's a long weekend we shoudl have time to do all kinds of stuff so they give us more work. I guess the professors don't realize that each teacher gives us more and we would like to have some free time too. I also have to go to all kinds of places this weekend. I have to go to LOCNAME to see my half sister because she's in the hospital for something, I really don't want to go though. We never talk anymore and why should I go see her when she can't even call me when she promises to. Oh, I met these friends at LOCNAME. They are so great. One of them really. Her name is PROPNAME and she's really nice. I think we might try to get an apartment together next year so we can live together and not have to put up with stupid roommates like the one I have this year. She lied to me about everything and I think she might be doing some kind of drugs or something. The other day I heard her talking to some friends about sniffing some kind of chemicals in some guy's dorm. I don't know what they were talking about, that is just what I heard. PROPNAME is talking about PROPNAME right now to my dad while my mom is sleeping. She thinks PROPNAME is so cool. I wonder if what I eat is actually eating a lot or if I'm just eating a normal amount of food. I try to eat 0 meals a day even though the food isn't always great. Oh, PROPNAME isn't all that great. Some of the food is good, but I can't stand eating there every day. They need to have food on this campus other than chicken. I love chicken and I used to want it all the time, but now since I've been here I've been dying for beef. The other day I was so stupid. I was talking to PROPNAME on the phone and I said, "I'm tired, but I don't want to lay down. I'm bored but I don't want to do anything. I'm not hungry, but I'm dying for meat. "  I bet I sounded so stupid. I drove home today from LOCNAME. I really didn't want to becuase I haven't drove anywhere in like a month, but I really need to start driving again. I can't wait till I get to go to PROPNAME PROPNAME again. I can't believe LOCNAME doesn't have them here. That is like the stupidest thing in the world. I take that back. The stupidest thing in the world is that ORGNAME doesn't sell Dr. Pepper anywhere!  How can they do that!  If you ask any person our age what soft drink they would prefer, the majority of them would say that they like Dr. Pepper the best. My mom just woke up. I finally found one places on campus that has it though. The Union has Dr. Pepper at the ORGNAME ORGNAME. I haven't checked anywhere else yet. My dad is talking about this guy's truck that got stolen today. I can't believe that happened. They live in a pretty good part of town and nothing like that ever happens here. My dogs are fighting. I have two dogs, PROPNAME and PROPNAME. PROPNAME is a red beagle that is Brewser's son and he turned a year old May 00, 0000. Brewser is a black beagle that turns 00 on October 00, 0000. It's weird to think of their age. PROPNAME is really crazy and Brewser is really calm. It probably is because he is so old though. I felt so stupid today in Biology. We had to work in these small groups and figure out these questions the teacher told us to do and for the first question, I sort of knew the answer but I didn't have it completely right. The second question was to figure out the hypothesis out of a group of statements but it was hard. When I was in high school we were always told to write a hypothesis in "If, Then" form. Meaning that this would be an example, "IF we put this together, THEN this should happen. "  In this class though, its just a statement. No ifs. No thens. No questions. It just made me feel stupid cause I could pick the hypothesis out of the group. There there was the last question that she asked and I had no clue about it. All that really scared me though because I am afraid of not making it in LOCNAME here at LOCNAME. Out of my high school we had 000 seniors. Out of those 000 there were 00 that went to college or went to some trade school or ARMY. Out of those 00, 00 went to aTm. I can't get over that. Only 0 of us came to ORGNAME and that is me and my ex boyfriend, PROPNAME. I am afraid of what all my aTm "friends" would say if I couldn't make it here. I really don't know what to talk about. I keep making all these stupid noises just because I can't think of what to say. My sister is now watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire and my dad just ate some M&Ms. My mom is out feeding PROPNAME and Brewser. Oh, PROPNAME is actually mine. I was too young for Brewser to actually be mine so he is actually my mom and dad's. PROPNAME has a dog, ferret, and fish at her house in Temple. The dog's name is PROPNAME. PROPNAME is laughing at me because she is reading what I am writing and she thinks this is the stupidest assignment in the world. I have to say, that since I've been writing it, I have to agree. I think it's kind of cool, but I really don't see the point in having to write this all out. Well, I understand that it is cool to see how the mind thinks and how our brain processes information, but this sort of seems like a waste of time. Oh, well. I'm getting credit for it. Oh, I might get to go to my first concert pretty soon. I'm going to try to get to tickets to the Austin City Limits thing. PROPNAME and PROPNAME were telling me about it and while I was in class today they tried to go get tickets. PROPNAME got one but while PROPNAME was in line, they cut everybody off like 0 people in front of her. 
__label__label0 This is a very interesting homework assignment. I wish the rest of my assignments were this interesting. I am a home right now. I can home for the weekend. It has been two weeks since I left for college and I came home. I know it is not recommended to do this but I did. I don't think it will affect me. The only thing is that I don't want to see my mom cry again. That is the worst part. I love typing, it is so much easier than writing by hand. I have not spoken to my two best friends. One of them I am kind of upset at because she is so infatuated with a guy that she blew her two best friends off. That really hurt my feelings. Wow, only two minutes have gone by. I wonder if I am going to have enough things to write about for twenty minutes. Doing the assignment for this class reminds of the class and the cute guys in the class. I have so much homework and I started to work on it at noon, but it is chemistry and it was difficult. I got very frustrated. I also had a lot of distractions. For example, I brought home two weeks worth of laundry and I have been doing all the loads since I woke up and had breakfast. That was about ten this morning. I wonder what is happening down in LOCNAME. It feels weird not to be there, and when I am there, it feels weird not to be there. I wonder what is happening at the Castilian. What is laundry boy doing?  Is he doing his laundry again. It feels so good to be close to my mom and getting her cooking. She is the best cook in the world. My sister's birthday is tomorrow and I am glad I got her her present early. My mom and dad came home with her presents today and she is really excited. My mom gave her her present and it was what she wanted. She was given the chance to get dad's present early too, but she decided to wait. The big game is about to start and I am contemplating about watching it. I really wish I would get around to doing my homework. I have been really bad at managing my time lately. I checked my loan status and everything has been approved. Thank God. Yes I will be in debt forever, but right now the important thing is to get an education at the place of my choice. I have to pay off debts that are roaming around. If I have money left over, I want to buy myself a lap top computer. It is so different how everything at LOCNAME is so technologically advanced. Is that how it is on other campuses. The big game is tonight. I wonder if I will ever get around to going to a football game. I think maybe for the experience. I sister was disgusted by something on TV. I can hear the dryer. It has been going almost all day. I had a lot of clothes to wash. How am I going to make time to do laundry. I think since I was instructed by mom to wait until I came home, that is why it piled up. I think I will do it weekly in LOCNAME. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing right now?  What is she thinking about the issue?  Does she know what is going on?  I really want to talk to her, but I will not look for her. I think it is her responsibility to see what made us feel bad. I think I have justifiable reasons to be mad at her. Wow, the time is almost up. I thought I was going to be dragging this on and on. I was just thinking of the ride home yesterday. I almost made a driving mistake that could have cost me. There were so many cars. Since I have not been driving in LOCNAME, it was weird. I tried leaving LOCNAME right as the schools had let out and there was a big traffic jam on I-00. I was crazy. I was just inching along. It took me about an hour to make it out of LOCNAME. My dad is such a goof ball. He was telling me how things are just not the same without me here at home. Everyone is really emotional. My text books were so expensive. I am still blown away by the prices. Then yesterday I had to buy a stupid calculator. I had a quiz and could not use a graphing one. 
__label__label1 go back back back to the disaster . I can't get that song out of my head. It was so weird on PROPNAME's board I couldn't understands what it meant till I read it out loud I wonder if spelling counts on this and if you can go back and correct mis spelled words  like they care. I am so bored but so excite about the job I have essentially been doing the same thing for the past three years and I think that I can handle the work load but this is college and its suppose TO BE HARDER BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T BEEN I STILL NEED TO read some of the info in the art history book that girl pre adviser said it would be fun but so far it has been a snooze feast. what else to write about I though that I would have bad dreams after watching train spotting with the dead baby in the cradle but I really having been dreaming much probably because I stay up half the night hanging out with the hall everybody seems pretty nice and all the guy are hot especially matt oh baby but I think that he likes PROPNAME everybody likes PROPNAME she has that LOCNAME accent and she pretty and nice I couldn't even get drunk guys to dance with me on Saturday the only guy I danced with was p and then when PROPNAME said sorry to interrupt while we were dancing he said there was nothing to interrupt what a jerky think to say I mean I was standing right there it wasn't like he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying pritvi is funny but quite the little gossiper I really like my floor when they offer me a spot out side of supplemental housing I probably won't take I because I know so many people here and hopeful we can become good friends I haven't had any real friends for the past few years I been so involved in school but the weekends were so boring with out a school activity to do I seen a movie with a group of kids  twice one was after a school event and the other was after a church h think. I saw movies that I didn't want to see and it was pretty much like any other movie I've seen by myself but I remember them better I only have ten more minutes left I like to count I'm always counting things like yesterday I counted lance Armstrong bracelets 0 on the way to the theater building and seven on the was back PROPNAME's doesn't count could I didn't see it on the walk I am so bored right now but I am going to be so busy with soccer, broccoli project, circle k, and hopefully crew or rowing which sound the same to me but apparently with rowing you only have one ore and with crew you have two I don't know what else to right where is PROPNAME I so think that he forgot to knock on my door and just went off to lunch with PROPNAME. I can't believe he slept with jo I mean they had just met and a hour ago she had been kissing PROPNAME I mean if I was PROPNAME I would have been pissed what if all my thought were filled with profanity since I don't cuss I just thought about it constantly but I think cussing is stupid and you have to be a certain type of person to say certain words I sound so stupid when I cuss  
__label__label0 hi I guess I'm supposed to be thinking about what to write for the next 00 minutes and 00  seconds, I will start with charlie my boyfriend of one month exactly today. long distance thing is  working out ok, I may be falling in love with him but then again he is going to be a cop and I  always said that I shouldn't marry a cop and he doesn't have a job right now so he can't take me  out that often. does him not having a job make him lazy? I'm not quite sure, when I was like 00 I  made a list of the basic things that my future spouse should have I wonder where I put that or if  he would fit into any of the standards I set for my self. he is the best guy I have dated so far, as  far as how he treats me and respects me so I'm doing all right for myself. I wonder what casey is  doing never mind she just walked in she says this asignment sucks and I agree maybe I will sue  you all for giving me carpal tunnel syndrome casey is leaving again, what a freak not really she is a  cool girl. I just ate so much food added up I had a fajita and a cup of chicken enchillada soup  and an ass load of chips and queso, I'm sure that I am the most gigantic person on the planet  what if I get heartburn from that queso. I am experiencing the sickness brought on by the lull in  my immune system brought on by the stress we talked about today in your class, yes  pennebaker, we do listen and you are quite entertaining, hope I don't forget to read the entire  semester, but at the rate I'm going that's what will happen, I wonder if you are married or if you  ever date your students. god bless your students if so. just kidding. I can't believe that I am not  going to have sex for like an entire month. this is craziness. I usta me borderline nympho. just  kidding again. hmm what shows am I missing on tv for this assignment, and are you all actually  going to read these assignments, I wonder if anyone writes a suicide letter in this or like  confesses to a crime. I stole a pen out of a lisa frank stationary set at walmart last year, but half  the stuff was missing out of it anyway and the pen was the best thing left, I think its somewhere  in my car there's lots of crap in my car, I need to clean it good and I need to have it washed the  leaves from the tree I park under are fucking up my paint. my mother would slap me if she  heard me say fucking up anything. hmmm. deep breath I have gone 00 min 00 seconds so how  much longer do I have? I suck at math, I have another homework in there. and I hate homework. I don't really consider this homework, ugh the word homework really gets to me oh yeah I now  have lets see, 0 minutes and something, gee where is that lighter I'm not going to be able to  smoke for like until I find it. after staring at this screen for 00 whole minutes I'm going to have a  headache and ah, the thought of being with my boyfriend, that's what they are talking about on  tv that would be great I miss him I wonder. did I already write about how I wonder what you all are  thinking about what I'm writing. I seem pretty neurotic. this is a fairly easy asignment. what  lawyer should I use to sue you all for this? not that I actually would or that I have grounds to sue. 0  minutes, three is my lucky number. uh. my fingernails need fixing. two. broken. what's a girl to  do? and to think that I don't have a nail girl to go see and I'm freaked out by the oriental people  to do my nails, so I'm pretty much screwed. count down-- 0 minute! yay I guess I will be seeing  you all around hope you enjoyed this tour through 00 minutes in my brain. its scary I know. alright  then I love charlie!!!!! I can call him now he will be so pleased. !!!!! bye 
__label__label1      I really do not feel homesick at the moment. Today a lot of my sorority sisters were feeling so sad because they miss their families and everything at home. In a way I do feel like I miss my mom and my dogs and LOCNAME in general but I am having too much fun in LOCNAME. More and more parties and events filled my calender as the week progressed and eventually I just got sick. Literally. I felt like I was spinning in bright lights and feeling more and more nauseated by the second. As soon as I started feeling that way, I realized the true comfort of home that I do miss a lot. Today I ended up waiting at the health center for two hours by myself and I really wanted my mom to be sitting there. I felt really independent which I liked, but I also felt lost. I had no support and I feel like it will be hard to not feel so sick with out my mom.        On another note, I am getting scared about this whole freshman fifteen thing. I am eating cereal at the moment and it is ten o'clock at night. It seems crazy to me. Hopefully all of the walking to class will clear off the extra pounds. I feel so terrible right now. I am so thirsty and my mouth is super dry. The doctor told me that my lymph nodes are swollen which scared me because they feel like they are going ot explode. My room mate will not stop humming and it annoys me as I write this. And all of her online music is driving me up the wall. It is getting so hard to concentrate on this paper. I am about to start getting ready for bed also because I am super tired. I really don't want to go to my 0 00 class in the morning. Do you know how early that is?  I am not looking forward to it. I hope the class is fun. It is about fashion design which interests me but I heard it is really hard and has a lot of projects. I finally got water. I am so excited. I really like the way my room is decorated. It is all pink and orange accessories and it is super cute. Ow. It really hurts to drink this water because of my nodes. Ouch. The doctor told me to inform her in case of that but I had not had a problem really. My forehead itches. I feel like I am complaining a lot as I am nonstop writing but I guess it has just been a really rough day. I really love UT though, I am having such a great time. It makes me laugh that you will probably not be reading this until I am on my deathbed. That will be funny. I bet this writing is really bad but I am just following the rules. This constant humming is really annoying me now. I have already told her to stop once but she keeps on humming. Oh well, I can not let it annoy me because we are best friends and room mates and all. This is going ot be an  awesome year. I can not wait till the time gets rolling. I really feel like brushing my teeth. I can still taste my Frosted Flakes. Gross. I have to remember to take all of my medicines for the night. I always forget little but important things like that. I also felt like putting on a facial mask to help my skin out. My skin seems to be really sensitive to weather and location changes. It kind of weird like that. Well my time is almost up. I feel like even though I am thinking about things, I can not really decifer what I am hearing inside my head. It is kind of weird. My room mate is staring at me trying to make me laugh, but the good student I am, I am trying to resist laughing. Well, I am about to go to sleep and my time is almost up so good night. 
__label__label1      I always have a million thoughts going on in my head but now that I am asked to write about them, I can't. I wonder where the printers are. its already 0:00. its so quiet in here. I wonder if this girl next to me knows where to print. it looks like she's buisy. this keyboard is dirty, the keys are hard to press. I shouldn't have thrown away my smoothie. its so dull in here. its already getting dark. I hope I'm spelling okay. I can't wait until tomorrow. "and I love you, and its more then I ever knew. " (I'm singing in my head). its too quiet, like we're not allowed to talk, its kind of depressing. I'm so glad I learned to type. I hope I can download my calculus homework on this computer. I hope I understand it. this weekend I go home. but the best part is going to be the six hour drive with my boyfriend. he's great. and I love him more everyday. I hope this feeling lasts. I would love to marry him, in like 0 years. he's great and we're great together, I miss him. I just saw him yesterday but I miss him. I'm hungry. I think ill take dinner up to my room and socialize with my roommate. I wonder what I'm going to eat today. I had a sandwhich yesterday. I should eat something hot. hmm. I guess I could have chicken strips. or vegetables. oo, and a salad. is that how you spell oo. oh, eww, uh, oo. ? oh well. now its 0:00. I wonder if I need glasses? this watch is bothering me. ah, there. my foot hurts so much. I wonder when the swelling will go down. I should email my dad. I hope my string doesn't come off. I forgot to put my rings back on. I hope I don't lose them. tomorrow I have an easy day, and I get to see fili. yah. yeh. ya. whatever. my head hurts. I should eat. what did I eat today. cereal. soup. hmm. I should eat dinner after this. I have so much reading to do. but its labor day weekend, so ill do a little bit each day and then finish this weekend. wow, my time is almost up. I hope I'm doing this right. hmm. I think so. I wish I could gain weight, well in certain places more then others. now someone else is sitting next to me. hmm. its so weird how there are so many oriental students here, its almost as if they are the majority. but that can't be right. it must just seem that way. there are so many people and I don't know any of them. someones chair keeps squeaking. oh, I need to sign up for those informal classes. what is that ringing. I don't think cell phones are allowed in here. I need to write a letter to danny. I wonder if hanna plays this weekend. I know they do. but where? hmm I need to find out, but soon. I wonder if I should tell my parents about me going home this weekend or just surprise them. I don't know which one is better or worse. oh well. that chair squeaked again. I don't see any printers. hmm. I should stop looking around, people are looking at me funny. its almost eight. I need to read. I wonder if the timer goes past twenty minutes or if it keeps going. well that answers my question. 
__label__label0 Hello, I don't know why I feel that I have to greet you, but I do. and I don't know who "you" are, because I have never tried to communicate with myself. that is so strange to me because I should know me well, because I am me. So. a stream of conciousness, eh? lets begin with the first thing I  look at: the keyboard. it is black, and the lettering is in white, capital letters. I know each of these letters by sound, and sight. how did I learn these? with out them I wouldn't even be here doing this. now I am hearing things. people all around me logging onto their computers just typing away, researching away. now a man is asking a question to one of the information people here. I don't know who they are, like how to adress them, that is. but they are here to help. and for some reason that makes me feel at ease. at ease from  what? I don't know . I guess the world is enough to make my being feel uneasy. my existence in this world makes me feel like I need to be recognized, sensed, felt, heard, or loved. isn't that strange? why do I need to feel this way? I don't know. but that's how I feel. moving on- what is another sense? I've gone over what I am looking at, what I am hearing and what I am feeling. but feeling in an emotional sense, not physical. I could have said I am feeling the contact between my fingers and the keyboard, but instead I chose to elaborate on my internal emotions, and that is not one of the five senses. isn't that strange? so that covers three out of five. what am I tasting right now? well, I don't know how to answer that. I don't know how to describe the taste of my mouth. and even if I was still eating, how could I explain the taste of a hot dog or fries or a banana? the only thing I could say is that "my mouth tastes like hot dog, fries and banana. " but that isn't necessarily what it really does taste like right now. now it tastes like nothingness, I suppose. what does nothingness taste like? I could ramble off synonyms, such as void or empty space even. but that doesn't mean anything untill a person consciously experiences it. right? like when a person learns what strawberry tastes like. there is no possible way to explain exactly the flavor of a strawberry. mmmm strawberries are delicious. that's all I would be able to say. and now I am actually CRAVING a strwberry! even me typing the word, and the big capital way that I spelled "craving" makes me want it even more. I am now trying to take my mind off of the mouthwatering fruit so that I can finish the last three minutes or so of this paper before I leave to go get some strawberries. it is a pretty strong urge for me to leave now but I have discipline. and that is what makes me different from everyone else. I have discipline. I won't leave now because my grade is so important to me. and its paying off, you know why? because I only have 00 more seconds to go!!! I am very happy now at the hought that I don't have to type any         
__label__label1      Well, I woke up this morning scared because I was dreaming! I think I was dreaming that I was being chased by somebody and I was running like hell!  My roommate PROPNAME woke me up because we were a little bit late to school and I jumped out of bed like I was on fire! I scared her just getting out of bed!! hahahaha! It was pretty funny, I guess!! Wow, it is a BEAORGNAMEIFUL day outside!  It's all cloudy and I hope it rains all weekend. The news said it would but I really hope they are right!! So, there's this guy that just got up and left. He looked maybe familiar but maybe not! He was wearing a red shirt and he looked kind of silly! Hahahahaha!!  Now this other girl just sat down to use the computer and she looks a little bit irritated!  I might be wrong but she's hitting the keys like she wants to kill!! I don't know. maybe she just type's hard. or something!! OH Yeah!  I had a good time in my math class today. I actually learned something!! It was pretty cool! You know, I come from a really tiny place outside of LOCNAME LOCNAME called LOCNAME. This place is huge for me!! It's like this whole library is the size of my town. All the people in it too. My town is tiny and there are a thousand people here!!! It's so crazy to come from a town that the population is the size of a full library! That's tiny compared to this place!  Along with all this walking in and out, I've never seen so many people get together at once and if I have, it was at my 000 student high school!! These 000 students were all four grades put together!  That makes me laugh because I feel like an ant here!! But that's ok. I will grow to be a big UT Longhorn!! Woo! Hoo!!  So,  I miss my little sister. She's 0 years old and I was like her second mommy. My older sister attends UT and she's been here for a while now! Back at home, It was only both my parents and my little sister and I !  When my parents went out I would have to take care of her and I practically did that all nine years of her life. practically!!! haahhahaha!! We all went out a lot so we left her with my grandmother or my aunt at times!! She was who I always came home to to play with!! She always wanted me to play with her and most of the time I did!! I would try to take her to all of my games in sports and all of my track meets!  She really loved to see me play!! She always wanted to play with my team and after every game . "PROPNAME, When I grow up, I'm going to play Basketball too, or volleyball and I'm also going to run track and throw the discus. Just like you!" Awwww. My baby wants to be just like me!! I think she's the one I miss the most because I grew up with her and she grew up with me!! WoW! She's so big now!! I can still remember when she was just a little baby!! Awww. my little baby! Oh yeah. and her name is PROPNAME PROPNAME just in case you wanted to know!  She's a very smart girl and I can't wait until she grows up!! She already knows what she wants to be. a Marine Biologist!! Can you believe it?!! She told me that!!! :-) 
__label__label0 so yeah. I finally get to the point where I feel like I have some sanity in my life, and back he comes. why did I let him back into my life?  I went out last weekend and had the weekend from hell. first the fire alarm, then the game (not too bad), then the car accident (thank God none of us were involved), and finally the other two ambulances in front of Halcyon. why can't just go get a damn cup of tea without the world come crashing down on me (improper grammar, I kmow. so is the punctuation for that matter). so anyway, back to jason. the bane of my existence and the one thing I cannot escape. last night I decide to try an dangerous tactic and back him into a corner just to see what he'd do. (probably should have left that up to the professionals - namely advisor jes who did it with me to get me to pick a concentration, classics or middle east. )  found out it doesn't work as well with relationships - esp. with a guy who has taken over a year to make up his mind and still hasn't really decided anything. talk about making me feel completely worthless. so I say, "you're still a kid. "  "I know. "  "so grow up, jason. be a man. make a goddamn decision. "  "I can't be with you. "  why does he always run?  my brother did the same thing. what is it about men that when faced with fight of flight emotionally, they ALWAYS run?  so unwittingly I cornered myself as well. I realized I can't let this man go, no matter how bad he is for me. I will continually put myself at his mercy, despite the fact that HE was the one who left me this summer. why do I make it so easy for him to come back. is a little bit of fear a healthy thing?  he's not afraid to lose me at all!  because he KNOWS that I'll never go anywhere. too bad the fool didn't KNOW that I loved him as much as I did. now how do I get that back?  I was crying on the windowsill. just one more part of the apartment to be initiated into my life with tears. I was hoping the sill would have been initiated in other ways. he promised to come visit me. this coming weekend was shot to hell thanks to ET. second time that bastard has screwed up my life. so I make him promise me the weekend after. only thing is that I had plans to celebrate my birthday with my friends that weekend. football game + club = fun night. now he's coming, hopefully. but yet more plans put aside for him. he would say, "but I never asked you to do that," or, "you're the one that wants me to come. "  why doesn't he get that I hate living like this, and it's HIS torture that makes me have to put my life aside?  so now what do I do?  I call him all day, playing phone tag, hating the hell I'm in. but I keep my composure. if anything I've learned in this last year of hell it's how to keep my composure. not enitirely sure what good that does me. damn this keyboard is spongy. wish it had that new full size one that has flat keys like a laptop. should make it much easier on the ORGNAME. so what was I thinking?  oh yeah, phone tag. I finally get to talk to him while I'm in the bathroom (wow does that gross him out) and I ask him if we can just pretend last night didn't happen. and he tells me I'm paranoid. fool, you told me you couln't be with me and I'm not supposed to be paranoid?  WTF?!  geez, I write a lot in 00 mins. this picture above the computer in the lab is. interesting, not really pretty. poor taste in art these people. so then he starts falling asleep, as ususal, and the conversation dies. and each time I try to resurrect the thing to achieve some sort of closure, I feel like part of me dies too. how many buckets my tears would fill over this past year I could not count. I'm so tired of crying. it's frightening that sometimes it's the only thing that makes anything better. and even more scary that I cry just to get a response out of him because he DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING!!!  the silence is pure torture and he must know it. but nothing ever changes. do I sound like I have abused spouse syndrome?  emotionally abused. tortured. dead. I wonder what these girls would think if they read over my shoulder. what would sameera say/do if she knew I was putting myself through hell again for this man?  time almost up. thanks for the opportunity for the release. 0 0 0 0 0 done.

__label__label1      Stream on consciousness, this is something I have done before, when I was writing my diary, I though it'd be a cool idea, I wrote down a lot of stuff, some having to do with music, some having to do with my boyfriend. He's a good guy, I miss him sometimes, well I do but I don't- it's not really an active missing, it's a passive missing, like I know I do somehwhere in my heart, but it doesn't hurt or anything I wonder what that could mean? everyone always asks me how long we'll last, and even though I'm not sure, I guess well last a long time, I mean its already been a year, which really doesn't seems so long anymore, only a few weeks maybe, until I really think about it. then its much longer. even though it all doesn't add up at first- it makes sense somhow. you know? it all makes sense when you look back at it all. I tend to think in really long streams and then my mind pauses, as if to switch subjects, not really to- well actually sometimes, to reflect on it- but I always inevitably move on, I wonder if that's what veryone's like. if they all reflect on their thoughts like I do, then move on. or if they thing continuosly only shifting smoothly from one thought to the next. there has to be someone like that, somewhere. maybe in china or some other country, but some where. I refuse to think that people all think the same, not only because people are inherently different but because even if 00% of us wer the same, there would have to be at least one person who's not. That's just the way I think. Ellipses are fun, they provide space, and soetimes a depth that no other literary device can reach. I'm not sure if depth is the right word of if tis truly a literary device, but ellipses are (thoughts search for word) something that people use. Woah, a mental stumble in words, I wonder how oftne I do that? I don't think I realize when taht happens, that reminds me of foreign languages- I like foreign languages. rightnow I'm taking dutch- but spanish is the one I'm most versed in. I think in spanish sometimes, its kind of fun, and I have always found it interesting that someone could actually think in another language then they'er own. I used to think when I was a little kid that that would be impossible- then I though itd be incredible, now that I can do taht it just seems like fun, I like it, it feels. Comforting somehow. I'm not sure why. it must be because my goal is to be fluent in as many languages as possible- though I'll probably do only four or five- someone in my class has a father that knows seven. I find hat amazing, it's simply amazing what the mind is capable of. Medicine is fascinationg to me, not just the cure type, but the physiological aspect of the human boday, and the relation so the psychological part of the human body, has always fascinated me, even when I was younger. I suppose I've always had a fascination with biology and the like and that is what has led me to this point in my life. its like my whole life up to this point has guided me to this exact path, and in a way, to this exact moment in time. perhaps only to point me in another direction. (looks up at light) not all the lights in this library are lit, I wonder why. maybe its because it would be too bright, or maybe because the sun is still out, or maybe some of them burnt out. I wonder if there's a pattern. (searches for pattern) no, there doesn't appear to be a pattern. not lit. lit lit lit lit lit lit not lit not lit lit all the way down the row, lit lit lit lit partially lit not lit lit lit lit lit all the way down the row (lost her place) ah well. worth a shot. I search for patterns in things a lot- very scientific like. that one police officer told me I sounded like a doctor. he asked me what I was going to ut to be and I said I was going to major in biology and become a doctor and he said "You sound like a doctor, in the way you tlak" I though that was kind of weird at first, but very logical. I am analytical by nature and tend to use larger words than many people, though they are not always right in my head- when I say them they come out right, and not only that but I love biology, and finding out what makes us tick, and wen I'm in an argument I try to see all the sides- and to see what's underneath it all. for instance I try to see what the ohr person is saying and why. what makes them say that. why they say it the way they do- I'm going to like this class- I like psychology. psych= mind. ology= the study of. I was in medical terminology. actually the class was called health science tech, but the main part was about medical terminology and working in the clinical setting, I worked at the hospital but instead of money I got grades, particiapation grades reall. it was fun, even the parts most would consider gross. I enjoyed it- but I don't think I want to be one of thos doctors tthat work in the hospital. I think my typingg is louder than everyone else in this library, the keys aren't the easiest to push. they stick a little, on some letters more than others. they're like keyboard keys that get stuck because you were careless and spilled soda on them, but a little looser. they're not quite tahat stick at all. but still they seem so loud. The guy outside in orange is drinking coffee- I like orange soda. its my favorite color and soda, good stuff. I wonder how much time people spend observing things outside their little bubble. if people had a bubble of consciousnes, it would be their immediate surroundings. just basically what they can touch, or what they can comfortably read. I wonder how many people ake time to see beyond that and what they're like. what type f people they are, if people really do have type. basically, what they're like inside. ar they analytical, whimsical, forward thinking? are they lacadaisical? what are they like? am I really one of them? I kind of think I might be or maybe one that is in between that and the other. maybe I'm right in the middle of two extremes like fire and ice, heaven and hell, earth and water. 
__label__label0      ORGNAME kickoff tonight. should be fun to watch. Going to get depressed watching them play. actually probably not, but I wish I could play ball ! I played highschool football, and actually did Div,. III equivalent in LOCNAME. that was fun. This assignment is too long should be 00 minutes, not 00. I read a book that was stram off consciensness (did I spell that right?). PROPNAME, by PROPNAME wolf. I was an ORGNAME book. it ought to be fun going back to norway this winter for xmas. can't wait to see my parents and sis. and dog. coach will send me a CD with all our game footage from last season. Go domers. He said I could play whenever I was in norway. awesome. I was a badass corner back. if I was 00lbs heavier (muscle) and faster I could play for ORGNAME. It would be a frikkin dream come true. that's one regret that I have in life. maybe one of my only ones: that I will forever just be a varsity highschool ball players. or maybe not its not that big a deal I guess. can't wait til I'm flyin in the LOCNAME air force! greatest country ever!! this assignmentt is getting old. nnobody's going to read all of them anyway green mesquite bbq. Mmm I don't really want to go, but I want the bbq plus I get to see rotc people but I actually don't really want to now I want to lay in bed and watch tv play ta. too lazy I get my guitar toorrow this keyboard is hard to type on this opps this assignment is terminated 
__label__label0 Well its after classes on this Friday. I am sll freaking' stressed out. Stupid Fahkerrdine's quiz kicked my ass. It's not that I don't know how to do it, it's just that I doubted myself. I don't know, ever since I have been here I think that I have gotten dumber, when in reality I am not. I am actually pretty damn smart. I am just letting what everyone says get to my head. So it pretty much is my fault anyway. Well from now on, I am going to walk around and take these stupid college quizzes and tests like I am smarter than the professor that made them. I probably am smarter than most of these professors, unless they are freaking geniuses, which some of them are. Damn I miss my girlfriend. She is like so freaking hot. Yeah I know she is sixteen but she doesn't look like it and I wouldn't be with her if she acted like a little girl. She is more mature than most of the girls I have for classes and some of my close girl friends. Damn I am sneezing well I am doing this in a friends room so yeah. Well PROPNAME is hot and I miss her. Its not really a distraction. Today I was tired I have no idea why I have been sleeping more than I ever have. I don't even read for classes. College isn't even hard. I could not read and make a C in all my classes but I want A's damnit. Stupid medical school. Wish I could fast forward my life about 0 years. But I'll be a pinche viejo by then. I wonder if because I am cussing the person that reads this will think I am an immature kid or ignorant, when in reality I probably have a more extensive vocabulary than them. And its not like I am a big cusser. Its just I have been so damn stressed lately. I was doing my chemistry homework and I ran my hands through my hair and my hair was falling out. Not like one or two try like 00 to 00 strands of hair. Um. went blank. Nah its frustrating that thoughts come and go faster than I can type them out. This keyboard's keys are all gay anyway. Well, here I am in college. Everyone once in a while it sets in. They are a lot of hot girls here. I really don't know if any of them are hotter than my girlfriend because I am in love. and yeah love makes you blind in some ways. I have been in love before. Went out with one girl for almost all of high school cept the majority of my senior year. Four damn years. My feet stink and its driving me nuts. Its like I can't wear sandals because they make my feet sweat so much. I wonder if other people have that problem. I am just going to by frebreze and shoot my damn sandals. Its probably all the bacteria on my feet. O well. Tonight I think I am going to get drunk. I have never drank before, well I have taken some sips like four. Beer tastes like shit. I am just going to drink "chick" drinks. I don't care what guys say. And if I do something stupid tonight o well, I need to wind down. I have been more stressed than this before, but this seems to take a lot out of me and it doesn't feel like it, until you realize it. O well. Sucks to be in college. You know my uncle is a millionaire and he is a college dropout. In fact I would say most of the worlds millionaire's are college dropouts or didn't go or went because they were already rich. I know I could do that but I don't know I guess I don't have enough confidence in myself to make it out there on my own. I don't think I like to take chances that have that great of a chance to fail. I don't like to leave things to chance. But then life has screwed me over so many times before even when I was doing all the right things so what was the point. I mean I didn't drink or do drugs I mean I tried marijuana once but c'mon that's not that bad. I love God I would go to church and like it, I would have my quiet time, I would be a pretty good Christian example till like my jr. year and what happened?  My parents got divorced, my dad made like all the money, there's five kids in my family, my dad went to jail for what he did. Gosh damn I am still embarrassed of what he did. So yeah all things this I was going to have like a nice car, my college paid for, super nice clothes I would have had it. He mad 00,000 a year and my mom made 00,000, and that's not too bad when you live in the valley. Its next to LOCNAME, and no we weren't drug dealers. Hah. that's funny if I hadn't put that in, you might have thought that. Nah he  
__label__label0      I just got done doing some homework for critical thinking and it is really late. I am extremely tired and I wish I would have done this assignment earlier. This is hard to write when I am so tired. I should have not talked on the phone all night and done my work earlier, but I was such a good conversation. Its funny how I always want to type about just nothing and now I can but it feels weird. Anyway my conversation was about me going home this weekend. I am going home because my uncle and his wife are down from LOCNAME LOCNAME and my mom wants me to visit. I wonder how my cousins (my uncle that's downs kids) are doing. One is my age and the other is two years older then me. They both go to college but I'm not sure where. I also have cousins that go to ORGNAME ORGNAME. the other day I was thinking about calling one of them to see if she wanted to hang out since we are so close. but I don't have her number. I actually havent even talked to her in a year almost. The last time I saw her was last thanksgiving. We always eat thanksgiving dinner and my great aunts house. Thinking about Thanksgiving is making me hungry for some green bean casarole. My mom always makes that for Thanksgiving. Its the best! So is fried okra. I had that for dinner last night with some mashed potatoes at the Jester City Limits. Jester City Limits has some good food but its very tiring and makes me feel like I eat to much, they should close earlier so I can't eat so much. Running is very good. I actually found the energy to go run today. In high school I played soccer so I was in really good shape and ran a whole lot. NOw I don't run at all and I need to. Hopefully I can keep the routine of running all the time. I was suppose to fun with my next door neighboor today but she went later. Its funny I have lived her and she has been my neighbor for almost two weeks and yesterday was the first time I meet her. She is a really cool girl. We also meet two other girls from the same hallway. I like meeting people. I also meet a guy and me, him, and steph went to ORGNAME how strange is that? then we went to go eat ice cream. It was really good, really expensive, and really sweet. The girl PROPNAME works at an ice cream/ coffee shop that is hiring now. I intend on putting in an application there soon. Jobs are good, because you get money and I need lots of money so I can pay for my traffic ticket. I speed everywhere and I get a ticket for running a red light. how weird. Yesterday my friend PROPNAME ran one too in front of a cop and he didn't get stopped. o the luck I have. I actually shouldn't complain about my luck, I know people with way worse luck then myself. my little sisters friend megan has really bad luck. Her dad died the other day. It was really sad I wonder if she is doing any better? probably. I wonder what the  little sister is doing right now anyway. I think she has a volleyball game tommorrow. She is so cute she plays soccer just because I played. I like how she looks up to me. I wish I would have had a really old sister to look up to. The closest thing to that where my cousins, who know live in LOCNAME and montana. LOCNAME would be a very crazy place to live. I'm not sure I would want to live there even though my grandma says it was vvery very beautiful. I am going to visit the old grandparents very soon. I am flying there in two weekends. I love flying, I have always dreamed of becoming a flight attendent one day. I think that would be so fun to get to fly anywhere you want whenever for free. I have always wanted to travel to different places and that would be the perfect oppurtunity. I think I just spelt that word wrong. o well I don't want to fix it. So I see that this writing assignment is almost done. that was the fastest 00 minuetes that have ever passed by I really want to go to sleep. 
__label__label0      Stream of consiousnesssskdj. How do you spell that? Fuck if I know. I don't seem to know much today. why the fuck am I so off. I'm just writing this shit cause it sounds pitiful. Or will hell the writing sounds like I'm writing for someone else to read. No one is going to read this, nor does what I write matter. So confess away. Make it worthwhile. What is this fucking heat I feel all the time, what the hell, I've heard the scientific explanations but they don't feel right. Hot cold I don't know. It prickles mwhen I should. I got a damn ticket today. my first one damnit. I was doing so good but I knew it was coming it was inevitable I f I brag about what I have why shoul di have what I get its not the fucking point to tel everyone else that I have it better than them. humanity is fuckecd can we save it which I knew I don't know anything all scienctific fac tis bullshit maybe some theory might hold over but that would be total luck. string wtf. microfribers connecting us all. PROPNAME that's ridiculous how do I float about life s  easily just things come when I need them to. really really badly and make an effort and it sthere. its that way for some certainly not job ha ha that's the fuckin shit dud ei m so funny. I really like my new sense of the humore isnce the rool. the roll. jese what the hell was that I would like know. Dead space. And I type what a prick. the constant battle. Why is there a batlle are normal people at peace I don't think so otherwise well religion . I wonder what time it is I'm going toclose fuckk shit I'm I sweare I'm wahts it called the shit I know fuck ah ah damn I forgot to much pot is that problem is it the drugs. I really need to stop smoking cigarettes why is it harder now that she will be here sooner shouldn't I be overwhelmed with joy, iam but also shit is just annoying and I don't know what to do about that, I wish I had some sort of sign but I already had my gift and know what I need to do how can I reationally use  a drug experience to justify mylife, but it just feels right you knwo the path, now don't fuck it, is that hard why am I lead so far astray things are fyckeed up she feels off and away from me I want this to finish so I can meditate since I'm almsot there how do I fall into trances so easily I feel the warmth over my body enveloping me. holding me tight in its arms guiding me a warmer shorre, I hate comign back I'm going to be out if I do that, its ok, I can talk to my baby while I'm eout shell understand my fingers are getting tired I can  type really relay fast if I want to ha anyone readying this hasd no idea how fast I'm typing, they could estimate but thye wouldn't know for sure so ha. Reviewing what I have writtin was odd, it was like reading a trippers rants while high. My warmth. Wow, I sound so out there. I do feel that this is the way though, my path was a gift and I should appreciate it. Most people don't get to have visions of their daughter, I don't rember the face anymore, I'm so lost. This is so hard to do. I hate it. Why can't we just have our time. Alone. Away. Just the two of us and then the little one. I can't remeber her face but I can remeber that emotion. what a physical change when I think of her. I can feel the warmth surrounding my body. The love taking everything over. but then the back gives out and I kill my chakras. Transliteration sucks. 00 min of writing my thoughts is intense. the difference in punctuation is shocking, in the begging I used a lot of epsilons(mas o menos) and was excited, then I peak and nothing but chops of sentances, no punctiuations, calm down, have commas, and then periods. awesome, I lost my network connection. I wonder if that ruins this. 
__label__label0 This is weird and different. I'm not exactly sure what I should be writing. I really love it when guys can play the guitar. I don't know what it is but guys who play the guitar are my biggest weakness. I hope, oh I forgot what I was going to say. that happens a lot. Twenty minutes seems like a long time. Anyway, I'm listening to LOCNAME LOCNAME by The ORGNAME and then I think I'm going to listen to my Sublime Cd. The Beatles were like musical geniuses. I bet them and PROPNAME PROPNAME are the celebrities that got the most sex from random women. I would have had sex with PROPNAME PROPNAME back in the day. I made a list of celebrities I would have no problems having sex with- it isn't very long but I'll share it because I really don't care. It's not like I'll ever have sex with these people anyway let's see it was PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, and PROPNAME PROPNAME. I bet PROPNAME PROPNAME is an excellent lover. No one who plays the guitar (and sings wonderful love songs) with that much emotion and feeling is a bad lover. Huh, I don't think that made sense, it made sense in my head. I'm so glad PROPNAME is my roommate. We have our differences but for the most part we get a long so well. Sex and the City is such an awesome show. I think each woman has a little bit of all four of the girls in them. Is it bad that sometimes I want to push my morals aside and do things I know are "wrong". Since I've gotten here my friends that go to other schools are bashing my new life style. I hate that they judge me. Why can't I just live my life the way I want to? Being active in the church youth group in high school was one of the best things I've ever done but now that I'm doing things that The ORGNAME wouldn't approve of I'm noticing that I'm pushing everything I used to stand for aside so that I can "experiment" with different things. I don't regret anything I do, but sometimes I don't think I make the best decisions. I'm happy though and I guess that's all that matters. I'm sure God is an understanding God. I'm not sure what's worse living my life as a straight edge or being taken up by the flashiness of college life. sounds like a lose lose situation to me. I really need to lose some weight man. I was sitting in the hookah bar tonight and this girl said she lost 00 pounds in a year and that she used to weigh 000. So now she weighs. 000. wow. I need to lose that much weight. I wonder how she did it. I should have asked her. some days I'll feel really self confident and pretty and I'm like well I guess I love myself the way I am so someone will love me for me as well. Then other days I'm like "fuck, who's going to love a fat slob". I hope I meet the one in college. I hope he's amazing in every way. Is it too much to ask to meet my soul mate? That would be sweet. First things first though. I need to shed the pounds ASAP. yes. After this I have to study Italian. That's going to suck. I probably should have done that instead of sleeping the day away. oh well. This week was a lot more productive then last. So this weekend I plan to really catch up and get my shit together. I really need to pull my GPA up. I want to do good. I'm going to do good. I just wish I weren't so damn lazy. Bah. I wish I were going to college station tomorrow. I want to see my old friends but I don't know why if they're just going to look at me like I'm the devil. My leg is still twitching. That probably isn't a good thing. I'm sad pookie's leaving this weekend. I wish I could find someone who enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I miss PROPNAME so much. I wish every time I was with him could be like that night after the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert. he's so much fun to be around. I think I come off as bitchy and annoying but I'm not sure. I wish someone would tell me. I have the Beatles song "Black bird" stuck in my head. I want to take guitar lessons I just wish they weren't so damn expensive. I'm so glad I only have one class tomorrow! Yay! I kind of don't want to go to the welcome retreat thing but maybe it will be for the better. Otherwise looks like I will be going to college station. We'll see how that works out. 
__label__label1 I just got back from the ORGNAME ORGNAMEs meetORGNAMEg. It was really fun and informative. PROPNAME PROPNAME was the guest speaker. He was very eloquent and well-versed, and he did an excellent job stating what he stood for and how the current gerrymandering is unfair, but we're not going to let it stop the party from victory. I hope to get really involved with it. It seems like a great way to get to know people and learn a lot about the political system at the same time. Other than University Democrat, I'm going to try to join ORGNAME, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. You have to fill out an application to become an At-Large member. The questions appeal to the creative side in applicant, so I hope that my creativity steps up to the plate. I think that ORGNAME would also be a great way to meet people, especially since it's for students in the Business school. I also want to join ORGNAME Government. I think that some of the causes that they fight for are so worthwhile, like trying to extend the hours of the library. Student ORGNAME in ORGNAME ORGNAME didn't really accomplish that much, but I think that Student Government actually gets things done here. I'm listening to the Shins right now, they're a really good band. I love the melodies and guitar. Other bands that I like include Bright Eyes, Death Cab for ORGNAME, The Sounds, PROPNAME and Sebastian, The Strokes, and so much more. Basically anyone on LOCNAME LOCNAME records tends to be really good because they all sound so different. I haven't really been able to find out about new music lately though because I've been sort of busy. I'm taking 00 hours, and my classes are Statistics, Latin 000, Psych, and Microeconomics. They're all pretty good so far, all my professors are pretty nice. I've had a lot of reading to do, and I've been pretty much doing my best to do it all. I'm waiting for a couple of books to come in. I'm waiting for my Microeconomics book and a Latin book to come in. I really wanted to take Intro to Political Philosophy instead of Latin, but oh well. I'm thinking about doing International Business, and Latin is the basis of all the Romance languages, so I hope it will help me with other languages. International Business seems to be like an interesting major, but I still don't know what I want to do. I'm probably doing Pre-Med as well, and I also want to take some ORGNAME classes. I don't think that you can take ORGNAME classes without majoring in it though, so I'm going to have to apply to that college, I guess. I hope I figure out what I want to do because International Business, Pre-med, and ORGNAME are pretty hard to do all together, and I don't want to take longer than four years to finish all that. I honestly don't know what I want to do, I want to do something worthwhile, something different, something exciting, something that's definitely not your average 0 to 0 job, something that truly helps people. I only hope that someday I will realize what I want to do. Although in life, everyone wants something more, no matter what people have, they usually want something more. I hope that whatever happens, I am content with what I have. Man, this Shins song, "Saint PROPNAME" is so good. They're coming to PROPNAME soon, I can't wait to see them. Bright Eyes is also coming soon, in October. That is going to be such a good show, it's been like two years since I've seen them live. I think that I can do those three things in four years though, if I take summer school, I think. I came in with 00 hours of credit, so I really hope that it's possible. I need to talk to my advisor about that. He's really nice, his name is PROPNAME. He's also my FIG mentor, I am in the Business of Non-Profits FIG. I've always been really interested in Non-Profit Businesses and how they run. Maybe I'll work for a Non-Profit Business. We're supposed to get guest speakers, and we're doing a Community Service project, so that will be cool. Well, my time's almost up, so I'll end here. Ciao. 
__label__label1 So this is the third time that I have tried to do this for some reason my computer is having some problems this morning. Explorer crashed and so I had to reboot my machine which can take a while. It's amazing how slow PC's get after you install Anti-Virus software. In the process of it rebooting I went and made a cup of coffee. Bavarian Hazlenut form ORGNAME, delicious. So I was thinking about this assignment and how it was similar to an assignment I took in a Humanities class a while back. They asked us to spend 00 minutes alone somewhere, anywhere just thinking about anything and making notes. I spent it in the campus parking lot, a wide open space, fairly peaceful, trees swaying in the summer breeze and began making notes, not really sure of the purpose. After the 00 minutes was up I realized that I was much more in tune with all of my senses than at the start. Normally I would walk around just using the sense that were needed, sight, hearing and focused on coordination, driving, etc. During the 00 minute period in the parking lot I became aware much more of my sense of touch, the feel of the paper I was writing on, the smell of my surroundings, the movement of the trees as they swayed in the breeze, I've mentioned that twice now, what does that mean?  I just finished my first cup of coffee. My apologies about my spelling. I have a tendency to just type first and ask questions about my spelling later. I don't know how this app handles me jumping back to correct spelling. I hope I'm not confusing it. Probably not. A thought of sunny beaches just jumped into my head for no reason. South Padre on a breezy summer evening. Again this breeze thing, what's with that?  In fact I'm thinking about the breeze that may be outside right now. I just went out to feed the cats and it was cool and a little breeze was in the air. Perhaps I need to go outside when I'm done here and soak it up. It's like a vitamin that the body is lacking, eventually you crave something that subconsciously you know gives you that vitamin. For some reason , perhaps I didn't get out enough at the weekend, I need to feel the breeze.  ORGNAME ORGNAME,  I have a coupon to ORGNAME ORGNAME sitting in front of me. I like that place and apparently if I go there this week and spend $00 or more then I can get $00 off rib-eye steaks. The fan spins slowly overhead, a gentle clicking, a low hum,  the sound of my typing and then, silence. Why are keyboards so awkward. Isn't there a better way to do this. Surely a Psychologist somewhere has studied this and come up with something, more ergonomic. I'm thinking about my brother. I just spent 0. 0 months in the ORGNAME ORGNAME during the Summer working for him, selling. They are a web services company. He is the owner and a good guy. He is the glue that keeps many things together. He has 0 kids who are all precious. One has a spine problem and can't walk. That unfortunately is the extent of my knowledge. English people are strange in that they make it hard to communicate simple things to each other. They do things that they think are right but in fact are completely wrong. I got attacked while I was in the PROPNAME PROPNAME. In the street at 0:00 in the morning on Friday the 00th. I was on my way to work and got attacked. The Police there are awful. They just don't care. They are nowhere to be found. In the most obvious situations where you would think they would be they hide and when you least need them they are there to hassle you. I have not been hassled but they are that kind of personality. Just my impression. Power hungry wimps. No idea for the big picture, just CYA and demonstrate what little power you have. Why can't they quantities the biggest problems and formulate a response and go about resolving it. Did you know that LOCNAME has now clearly taken over the spot of the capitol for drunks in LOCNAME. The British government will be introducing laws next year to combat the problem. Why do they not have a public intoxication law now????  You can be drunk in the street hassling old ladies and get away with it while the police stand by and chat to one another!!!!  Well my time is almost up in fact a notice just came up. Time to go. Hope this has not been boring. Have a great day. Go LOCNAME!!!
