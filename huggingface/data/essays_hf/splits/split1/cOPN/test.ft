__label__label1 I had just returned from other interesting dinner experience at my frat house when I realized that I was just wasting time as usual. So I decided I'd turn on the old computer and do a little stream of consciousness writing. I'm sitting down at my knew desk, that to tell you the truth, has done me no good except for a good place to put my computer. My roommate, an old friend I've know throughout my life is out doing his fraternity B. S. and probably won't be back until twelve. This I really do think is funny because coming into school I was completely busy from day one, while he just sat on his beanbag chair and watched t. v. To tell you the truth all I really care about any more is the amount of time I get to spend sitting in my beanbag chair watching t. v. Although it's not really as fun as it may seem, because while sitting in the beanbag chair the only thing on your mind is when you're going to have to get up and go do stuff. I realized today in class that when one begins to get about half the amount of sleep that he used to get it does become a little bit irritating and depressing. All I can think about is when I can rest may days have turned from full productive days with good night sleeps over the summer to half ass, sit around and make up excuse my I shouldn't leave the room so I can get some sleep worthless days. I'm pretty sure that last sentence made absolutely no sense, so on that last thought I think  I'm going to leave the room for the umpteenth time today and go do things that I really wish I could accomplish by getting into bed and closing my eyes. 
__label__label0 always a problem. My hair is really wet and I should go dry it, but this assignment is what I need to do now. I almost slept through my eight o clock class, but I somehow made it. Ok this show keeps getting cheezier and cheezier oh dear. I have to cash a check and deposit it so my check book balances, which is something that needs to be done and really quickly because I will have to pay extra for all the hot checks I have written- uh oh. My twenty minutes probably seems shorter because I am a slower typist than most people. PROPNAME is a psycho whore, I hate hate her. Something shocking happens on this show every 0 seconds. I don't think that Days of our lives is a good show, but I seem to be addicted to it anyway. PROPNAME is so nice and her and LOCNAME are finally together, but probably not for long because there is s 
__label__label1 I don't know what I am going to do in this. This type of assignment is something I have not done before. I guess I have no idea is because that I do not have a topic to write on. I have always have had a topic assigned to me. This is el-hazard music. Just by looking at the images of the CD cover, I can tell that this is going to be good. In fact, I am listening to it right now. I have no idea why I am writing this down in here, but it is a part of my thought. This has a lot of base, but it does not stick out. Has a very good balance of treble and base. What am I going to write about. I am hungry. May be I can go to kinsolving later. I think that they start dinner at four thirty. Another track has started. This is a slow song now. It is the music from the fourth episode where the demon goddess is freed from her master's control and gained her freedom for the first time. The cat  Ura was cool. She can mountain climb. I think that was a cliff. She is the coolest cat ever. I have to do this for 00 minutes. What oh yes the ura. The series is El-hazard. They don't have anything good on the internet on it. this sucks. I have to download that song tonight. I hope this time the connection is good enough. Why is some of the music stupid. Wait, if I listen to this closely, it is very good if the voice of the actress is older. The story has good development. The ova series starts with the discovery of the demon goddess ORGNAME in a certain high school and the main guy is sent to the world El-hazard through a portal created by PROPNAME. Why is the TV series different from the OAV series. The princess PROPNAME PROPNAME looks cute, I like her better in the OVA series. I think a world like el-hazard lives in our hearts. PROPNAME PROPNAME was rescued by the teacher. That was cool. PROPNAME kick. There were this little girl in the story. She was PROPNAME. The 0 priestess was pretty. fire, wind and water. Reminds me of Ah megamisama. 00 minutes. Ifurita was awakened by junnai. Then he and Ifurita invaded  PROPNAME the kingdom of El-hazard. They had to use the eye of god for defense. The TV series was called the wanderers. that was cool. The main guy can access ancient relics. He gave back ifurita her freedom by turning off the master obey chip. The war was still going on the LOCNAME used the eye of god. Kimdom of bugrom got kicked. The shadow nation intervened. The moved the eye of god out of control for the revenge a long time ago. They were remnant of the tribe that come across this world when the eye was first fired. They were hated afterwards. PROPNAME. I am hooked on this series too much. The main guy got control of the eye through Ifurita but Ifurita sustained the impact and was transported to the location where the high school will be in 00000 years. Ifurita then waited 00000 years for makoto to appear and send makoto to the land of el-hazard. After the impact, Ifurita learned the secret of eye of god. It is a dimensional cannon. what was cool. is it 00 minutes yet. Still 0 minutes. Have I been keeping time correctly. KOR orange road. I am still listening to the same music. cool. I can't wait to see the TV series tape # 0. It is going to be very good. I don't know I guess I am too excited about this thing to stop, I have not even realized I stayed on the same topic for long. men. 
__label__label1 Psychologists. Always trying to understand how the mind works, and how it doesn't work in some cases. Can such things be understood, or are we merely deluding ourselves that knowledge of any kind can be attained?  I guess I've always found psychology to be a very pretentious field. though an interesting one. We all want to control our lives, and anticipating the actions and desires of others helps us maintain that facade of control. Perhaps I'm getting into a more philosophical realm at the moment, but that is where my thoughts take me. Is free will merely an illusion?  I've thought about this a lot. Unfortunately there are no definitive answers to this or other questions. Is there a god?  I've never heard a logically sound argument for the existence of a god. I allow for the possibility of a deity, but it certainly wouldn't be the Christian God. I think ultimately that I have to agree with the existentialists. There is no proof for or against the existence of a god, so we should stop wasting time speculating and just deal with this life. Few people can deal with that. Our fear of death makes us create religions, so that we can pretend there is some semblance of life after our earthly bodies die. These are not new thoughts, I'm just thinking on demand; my mind moves most easily to the pathways it knows, and I present some of the more coherent ideas here. Is someone actually reading this?  Do you understand that I am human?  I am not an object. I am in a body, but I am not the body alone. I am a mind, vast and complex. I am. Do you feel superior because you can analyze minds?  I ask you this, so that you can ask yourself. Do you enjoy treating people as objects?  Do you even admit in your conscious mind that you treat people as objects?  Perhaps not. It's possible that I'm being slightly unfair to you and your profession. Still, it is good to raise questions. We are all just a bit too complacent and easily controlled. I see the need for religion, but I think many of us are above that. I don't need to buy my morality from someone else. What moralists and philosophers do I respect?  PROPNAME, for his logic. PROPNAME, except the theism. PROPNAME, for his explications of metaphysics and epistemology. PROPNAME, except at the end of his days. PROPNAME, except for his dependence on rituals and his arrogance. Psychologists and behavioral scientists?  I stay away from most. At some point I'll get back into it, but I was just too turned off by PROPNAME and his pretentious assumptions. Other reading?  Fiction, lots of it. I would name a few dozen authors but then why subject myself to the judgments of someone I can't even see. Music. I find music to be very important. You can't get by without music. And you can't just listen indiscriminately either. I think a real understanding of notes, rhythms, chords, and instrumentation is required before one can say anything about any kind of music. Do you understand music?  How are you reacting to my questions?  You must be used to asking the questions instead of having someone else ask them. Are you getting anything out of this?  Is this more interesting than most responses to the same assignment, or do you even care?  Are you turning to a colleague and saying "hey, this kid was actually making a futile attempt to understand my motives. "  Fun with role reversals!  I considered producing a surreal and rambling narrative for this assignment, but then you might have taken that a bit too seriously ("bob, we got another wacko here"). Ah well, time passes and other pursuits await. Goodbye for now.  
__label__label1   There is this chomping sound coming from my brothers mouth. He's eating cereal. Sometimes I am jealous of this, because he  has his own place with a kitchen and food and everything. Even  PROPNAME has his own place with a kitchen and everything. Someday  I will have these things for myself. My own life, with my own things. Like in Days of Our Lives. There will be days of my life when I  do what I want, with whomever I choose. Until then I must continue  doing things their way . Everyone else’s way, like my mom. My nose  itches. It is a very natural thing to scratch an itch, or itch a  scratch?  It is very annoying to itch. When I got sunburned, I  itched extremely badly. PROPNAME laughed at me because I was jumping  around in discomfort. I never want to feel like that again. Sunburns suck. I miss PROPNAME though. Even though I did not see her  much, I always knew she was just down the street. But things are  different now. That made it sad for me to leave. The fact that  she isn't down the street anymore. That was like a security for me. Just knowing. I am in a hurry to finish this assignment. I have to be in class in about half an hour, and I am nowhere close to where I need to be. Life can make you feel like that. Like you are never at the right point, where you need to be. Everything in never alright. That's and oxy-moron. Things don't  work that way. But things do tend to work themselves out. You just  have to keep moving to get through the bad stuff. I always want  something better. I feel like I am always in transit. It's had for  me to be happy with the present. At least I can let go of the past, now. That was an accomplishment for me, not to dwell on memories anymore. Still, I look forward to, and fear the future. I do know things are good  now. I am on my own, a little bit. I don't want to rush things. I am in no hurry to grow up. Well, not a big hurry at least. I do want the rest of my life to come. I want to marry PROPNAME, have  a house, and pets. I am going to have a rabbit. Maybe two. Kids  eventually, but not for a long while. The television is such a distraction!  I can get side tracked forever. I like how it takes me out of this life. It is definitely  an escape. 
__label__label1 So what should I write? I have no clue. Oh, about the survey I did in the  class today. It's pretty good. I mean I like the one on homosexuality. I  am gay, and I know my answers are very biased. To me, I either strongly  agree or strongly disagree. Hey, it's about my identity and the society  I am living in. I have to, sort like, defend for what I believe in,  although I don't have much choices in picking my own identity. What am I  thinking? Why am I so excited about it? I have come out for a rather long  period of time, yet I am still nervous about the whole issue. I am a very  lucky guy, I have not met a lot resistance from the society as a whole. Somehow, I only have the problem finding the right guy. When I was young,  I have those innocent thoughts about love and romance. I have always  believed that there definitely is a right guy for me. Yeah, that was a huge joke. As I become more mature, I become more practical, just like everyone  else. All right, I shall only speak for myself. I know love to me is a  pathetically realistic concept. No more space for imagination. God, why am  I writing this? I had just promised myself to forget about the existence  of love, right after the PROPNAME issue. It shall not work for me. I am too pretentious, arrogant, determined, etc. Anyway, moving on to something else. Man, there are 00 more minutes left. The sky is so dark. I wonder what is  out there. I know one thing is that I am not scared of anything. I want to  know, I want to discover, I want to enjoy life beyond it's practical  dimensions. There is the moon. No, I am lying. The moon is not visible at the beginning of the month. Well, I wish I could see it though. I have  heard enough Chinese stories about the angels on the moon. I hope I can live there sometimes. The earth is too complicated, and it is also very cruel. I just want to go somewhere and forget all the problems and relieve all the  stress. I really just want to be with my closest friends for a little while  and leave everything else alone. Oh, not possible. Why am I writing this. I swear to God that I have never been so senseless before. My fingers are  typing things which my mind cannot direct. Weird, I need help. Maybe this  is the point of this assignment, to get lost and throw away the conscious. Ok, 0 more minutes. What am I going to do this weekend? How about 0th  street. I really like Paradox. The music is good and so is the place. Yep, that's it. Friday night hanging out with pals. Cool. Maybe I can meet some cute guys. Oh, come on, my brain is out. My roommate is home. Finally. I gotta go, time is up, my fingers are little tired. Bye. 
__label__label0 As I sit here in my dorm room, I am thinking about what I am supposed to do tonight. I have signed with the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu and I am not sure what pledging is going to be like. It could be tough and it could be easy. My roommate is here and he is going to take a nap so I need to try to be quiet as I type. I am kind of anxious about this year and what the year will be like. There are so many people here and I am not sure whether I am fitting in well or not. Anyway, I get side tracked easily. I am going to the house at 0 PM and there we are going to be introduced to all the older guys and then we will probably introduce ourselves to the rest of the pledge class. I am anxious to meet all the cool guys who I am going to be spending the rest of my life with in college and hopefully there after also. I miss all my close friends at home. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME and they are mostly going to ORGNAME but some of them are spread out across the country. I miss my friend PROPNAME the most and my best friend PROPNAME the 0nd most but hey I hope they come and visit but if they don't oh well. My mom worries me cause she thinks I am doing alot of bad thing s here at school but really I’m not and I am being a good kid and trying to make good grades. I miss my little brother too. he is 00 years old and he is in 0th grade. I hope that he is having fun in junior high school cause I know I did. I keep telling him that high school is the best time of your life. He believes me but he cannot wait until next year when he can go to high school. My great grandmother is very sick and she is 00 years old. I went to visit her the day before I left for school and I was thinking that I may never see her again. She has lived a long and happy life and whenever the time comes, I know that god was the one who wanted her up there. M<y roommate is going to nap now for real and I am supposed to wake him up in an hour. I hope I’m not still typing by then. The room is quiet now and I am the only one still making noise. My suite mates are all out at class and they will be back soon. I kind of always think about what I am going to be when I get older and when I am married and who am I going to marry and what my profession is going to be. I want to be an orthopedic surgeon but that is very hard to be and I am not sure if I can be that. But I set my goals already and that is my destiny for my future. I want to be successful and have a family of 0 and a nice looking, perfect wife who loves me for who I am not for what I look like or how much money I make. I am ending my stories with a quote :Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you will be amongst the stars. 
__label__label1 Well I'm finally getting around doing the writing assignment, I'm feeling  relieved. I thought that for some reason I would not have the time to do  it, actually not get around to doing this assignment. I don't know the  reason behind that worry. hmmm. what do I write?  well I'm getting  tired already and I'm thinking will I be able to stay awake for thirty  minutes to type all this??? I hope so. well I'm thinking about my classes  and panic is setting in. I'm worried. I'm falling behind with reading  material in my courses and not . my mind has moved to something else. THE ORGNAME. I realized that I had to take it this spring so I’m getting  really nervous about it. I'm getting nervous now thinking about it. well  my eyes feel really tired. I want to sleep. I still feel nervous and anxiety towards this semester/the mcat/medical  schools/exams. I usually don't feel this nervous but since this year  counts so much with medical schools I feel that top performance is . what's a good word?  ummm. My mind is drawing a blank. essential?   well good enough. I feel I must perform beyond my own goals. hmm. well I don't really agree with that statement. I just feel I need to  do good. I need to be satisfied. Hopefully get a 0. 0 this semester. what else?  I'm thinking what else I should write about? It's quiet in here. the fan is turned on. BUT its a LOCNAME. or bay  something. let me  see if I remember?? NOPE I sure don't. Well I didn't exercise today,  which explain why I'm soo tired. I love running it gives me so much energy and makes me feel great. I love working out, but nowadays I don’t have much  time b/c I live off campus and commuting and parking takes too much time  that I just run at home sometimes, if I find a running buddy. the  nervousness is gone, but it left a massive headache. massive, I like that  word its sounds so cute  when English people say it with their English accents. I'm worried. again. actually I'm thinking about my teacher recommendations  which is getting me worried. so I'm worrying myself now. too much of this  is not too good. I knew a girl who used to give herself ulcers,, I'm  wondering if it was psychological?  well,, probably there was some  psychological reason. woow,, I'm so happy I'm taking this course. its soo cool. I'm really tired. and bored now. yet I feel indifferent. as I was saying I think psychology is soo interesting. it seems really cool. The lectures are awesome. I'm happy. until the  first round of tests. curiosity and anxiety well not really I'm kind of curious . I'm thinking about my friend. old roomie. she’s in the corps at a&m and I'm  worried about her. I wish she would quit because they are so ridiculous. their little rules are ridiculous. when people have to pee in their sinks  because its easier to do than go to the bathroom that's when you have to  worry. I'm still worried. she's a good person. but that the path she  chose for herself. I’m hoping this will make me feel better. its working  I feel better now. but I'm still worried not so much upset,,, I wonder  how long I've been typ0ing?  I hope long enough let me take a peek at my  watch. YUP!!! yes! its been 00 minutes I'm not sure if I did this right. I sure hope so. I'm getting sleep and I still have a ton of work to do. I think I'll sleep my brain needs to replenish the exhausted brain cells. well I guess I'll end this now and go to bed. One thing I noticed is that  I was kinda indifferent not too emotional all through this because of my  fatigue. well . good night. and sweet dreams. and as my old roommate  would say. " don't let the bed bugs bite". I hope she pulls through. 
__label__label0 The computers at ORGNAME ORGNAME have no modems. I learned that the hard way. So far, here at LOCNAME, computers have been quite a pain in the ass. My password for UT access won't work. Maybe because its nine letters. I can't tell; the instruction sheet said that you're password should be up to 0 letters, not that it had to be at least eight letters. Here in LOCNAME should means has to, I guess. Sir PROPNAME is gone, I guess. He did that PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME song, and then he disappeared, unless you’re a hardcore rap fan. I once read about some little down in the LOCNAME where a bunch of rappers lived and made music. Like PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME lives in LOCNAME, LOCNAME, where I went to summer camp one year. We called ourselves the Homies, and had an old cowboy hat called the Homie Hat. Some guy in another tee-pee shot it up at Riflery one day, so we had a funeral service, of which I was the preacher. We made am H out of rocks above the hole where we placed the hat and said a prayer. The counselor said it was sacrilegious, but we went through with it anyway, and later dug it up and moved it because we thought some one was going to grave-dig it. That’s a great piece of trivia in my life- Where ids the HOmie Hat buried?  Someday, maybe I'll go visit PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and we'll go up to ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME camp along the banks of the ice-cold LOCNAME LOCNAME and find that H. That would be cool. When I was younger we went to the Monahns in LOCNAME LOCNAME, whenever we were visiting my grand-parents in LOCNAME. Now my mom and grandmother are in a big tiff over a pins shower cap in the upstairs shower. Its a silly fight, of course, but I guess its kind of interesting to see who gives in and talks to the other first. My favorite tiff ever was the Tongs-Becky tiff of late 0000. It involved car accidents, lies, rumors, name-callings. Now Tongs goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME, in the Big Sky conference, which brings me back to tiffs. I knew this girl at ORGNAME ORGNAME's named PROPNAME who had a friend she hadn't seen in a long time who went to ORGNAME ORGNAME, which I think is in the Big Sky. So I told her that next time she emails her she should mention that she knew someone in LOCNAME who had a friend who was going to another Big Sky school. I don't think she ever intended to do it, but she emailed her anyway, and this Southern LOCNAME girl never wrote back. I guess she'll never know about the whole Big Sky? LOCNAME coincidence, unless PROPNAME told her, which I rather improbable. She obviously didn't care. PROPNAME stole PROPNAME PROPNAME's straw cowboy hat, which is now sitting right in front of me as I write. PROPNAME PROPNAME, from LOCNAME, was playing at the LOCNAME LOCNAME, where we saw him a year before and when he crowd-surfed, PROPNAME just yanked it off his head. It was badass. PROPNAME says he doesn't feel bad about it. I wonder if PROPNAME misses that old hat. I think he does, but he learned a valuable lesson, like when PROPNAME PROPNAME lost his guitar, and found it at some bar in LOCNAME LOCNAME a year later. That story is probably bullshit, as most of PROPNAME PROPNAME's seem to be. It doesn't matter- I don't pay to hear storied from an era in his life that he probably really doesn't remember, but I do wish he's play a bigger variety of songs- the man has released over 00 albums- all different, yet plays the same set at every concert. I've never even heard Pot Can't Call the ORGNAME ORGNAME, and that’s one of his biggest songs anyway,. You want stories, talk to old PROPNAME- his stories pretty much suck, but his pride in telling them is what is so interesting. He makes a walk from LOCNAME to the LOCNAME LOCNAME sound fascinating, while I almost get lost lost-to-death in some God-forsaken part of LOCNAME LOCNAME, and I can't even keep people listening. 
__label__label0 Well I am sitting here in my room and it's about 0:00 PM. My roommate  is on the phone so it's not very quiet in here right now. Last week my boyfriend hooked up the Ethernet on my computer. After trying to get it to work we finally got everything hooked up. It seemed to be working, well all of the programs  were working but when I went to shut the computer down it came to a blue screen and my computer was messed up. It said a bunch of stuff about pressing a key  to terminate a program that wasn't working, well I pressed a key and the screen was frozen. What's wrong!!!!  I restarted the computer and shut it down again and it still did the same thing. Today I turned the computer on and it did the  same thing. I called the computer center and after being on hold for an hour I finally go help, well I guess you can call it help. He couldn't help me but he set up an appointment for Friday with someone who will help me. Hopefully I can get this thing figured out. I just bought this computer a few months ago and  it was very expensive. Well enough about computers. I am a little tired. I had an 0 o'clock class, after the class though I came back to the room and took a  nap until 00:00. I think that made me even more tired. Well I need to start reading my English. I have a book I have to finish by Thursday. I am half-way through, but there's still 000 pages to go. I hate reading!  I read slow and it takes forever. That's not very good for an English major. I should enjoy to read, especially  because I will be doing a lot of it in the future. I am a sophomore student here but this is my first year here. This is a big change, I am very close to my  family and it was hard to leave them. I am 0 0/0 hours from home so it's not that far, but it's still a lot of driving for the weekend. I went home this weekend. I was glad to be home. I'm not sure if I like this place yet or not. I think it will take a little time. At least my roommate is sweet, we get along good. That's a positive thing. The bad thing is that last night we found roaches under the sink. Babies so they're everywhere under the sink. It is really gross. I never saw roaches before so I freaked out. The weird thing is that we don't  have any open food, I guess the roaches are looking for the water and it's also  dark under there. We put a request in to have someone come and spray. They  haven't yet. I hope they come soon!  Well my time is almost up. This was really  weird just writing off of the top of my head. Actually it's kind of peaceful because I enjoy typing. Well I have my psychology class next, at 0:00 PM. I need to get ready for class. I need to check if they got the books in yet. Last Friday they didn't have the book in. Well my time is up so I will submit now. Until the next assignment. see you later!!!!   
__label__label0   I am feeling a little hungry right now. What should I do? Go to Jester, go out to eat, make something here in the dorm. Maybe I should just go to the Union. Lets see, I will change clothes and go shower or something. I'll get my comb and toothbrush and go to the restroom. What do I wear to go out tonight?  I think I will wear my white Polo shirt and my black shorts. No I'll wear my khaki shorts and my white tennis shoes. I can't stay out to long since I have so much homework to do. The entire English rough draft to do, my pre-calculus, and all my psychology reading to do. Man, I feel sleepy, guess I should have gone to bed early last night instead of watching PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Maybe I'll just come back and sleep after my biology class tomorrow. I wonder what is on T. V. right now. It's mostly just the news. Good! Entertainment Tonight is on now. Hope it's a good show. Let me start washing up and changing my clothes for supper. I don't think it will rain again so I guess I don't need my umbrella tonight. I wonder how much I will have to do tomorrow. I still need to go draw my tickets for the Longhorn game on Saturday. I hope the seats are better than last time.

I don’t even know if I say it right  hey there's my ra ana sitting at that computer computers make such an annoying bussing noise but not like a bee a lot softer and different my shoulder hurts and I don’t know why I need to go work out and get into shape because I’m not at this moment but I’m getting some exercise  waling around this campus I wonder what the twins have been up to or if they even think about me probably not but I don’t care cuz I don’t like jax anymore  really I don’t there are so many other guys here I figure out of 00,000 00,000 have to be guys and at least 0,000 have to be cute so at least at least 000 have to be gorgeous if not more why  cant I find a guy I just don’t understand what’s wrong with me they only want the super skinny girls or I don’t know I mean I’m not ugly and I have a great personality I think I’m pretty not supermodel gorgeous I always say that when someone asks if I’m pretty I’m too shy aghhh why is it that Mac computers aren’t as cool as ORGNAME???/ I've always wondered that I need to blow my nose  its itching popping your neck or whatever sounds so crunchy I think if I ever got in a car wreck id break and die because I pop everything its kinda gross if you think about it 
__label__label1 and now its time to write about this wonderful stream of consciousness stuff  that we learned about in our high school English class and about all the greats  like william faulkner. you know, its kind of annoying that I should have to  hit enter at the end of each line as though this were a typewriter, you might  look into the text instructions for this window in the original scripting to see if it can be made to auto-return like some of the others do, but this is still a  rather well laid out page and method of submitting a psych project. kudos to  you. I wish my other teachers would do this. so what am I thinking about. well there's the LOCNAME/Pittsburgh football game on TV right now. I have  no idea whose winning or anything like that because I’m not really paying THAT much  attention to it or anything but LOCNAME did make a great touchdown a while ago (aha! Washington’s in the lead thirteen to seven) marvelously exciting I know. lets see. what else. well now here's a good one. I have to write this bioethics paper about an case  study (why don’t the delete options work properly in this window) on this couple who undergo an "amniocentesis" test on their newly discovered child (don’t worry its still in her womb) and they find out that the child has a genetic disorder  called turner syndrome. what I have to do is write about this case and give my  Prof. an opinion one way or the other as to whether the couple should abort  the fetus or keep it. which means in turn that I have to come to some sort of  conclusion as to my beliefs on abortion. what a task. what a mind-consuming task but then maybe I shouldn’t tell you that I’m thinking of something other than my  psych writing, but then again, I don’t imagine you would expect us (I’m not  referring to myself as us, but rather the class (hate for you to think I’m schizo  or something)) to focus directly on the task at hand since as best as I can tell the task at hand is not focusing on the task at hand quite specifically so and another thing, whenever fox sports shows a little window w/ player stats they play this obnoxious little theme music blurb on piano and I've heard it at l a million times and its starting to grate on my brain or something. so back to biomedical ethics: everything that I have been taught tells me that abortion is wrong for all the  reasons and everything, but is it fair to bring a life into the world w/ such a  condition. but then again, there are many things much worse than turners  syndrome. like what if she was born a democrat. that would suck. and now my friend from back home has just sent me a message on icq. she’s a nice person. not incredibly attractive but very loving and compassionate. but none the less, a wonderful friend. she’s still at home right now b/c she’s going to ORGNAME and school doesn’t start until like the end of September or something. she got  a job but I think she’s still bored as hell just sitting around talking with  the little kids who are still in high school and she gets to hear them complain  about the orchestra director and all that nonsense. I just explained to her  what I’m doing. the internet is a wonderful thing I think. I can talk to a  friend for free in almost real-time over icq (another great thing in the internet) any time that I want to. and now there's one of those funny PROPNAME PROPNAME commercials on TV. they’re just a hoot. well, my twenty minutes are just almost up, so I think that ill be off now. its been real fun chatting with you. have a nice day and all that. 
__label__label0 Well, here goes nothing. I decided to do this assignment while waiting for class. I arrived at 0, class starts at 0:00,my bad. Guess I'll just transfer it to computer later. This hallway isn't particularly quiet. The door next to me squeaks. Not like a mouse mind you, but that annoying oil-me-sound. This hallway looks different than all the others. I don't know why that is exactly, it just does. I don't seem to be having that many creative thoughts. My suite-mate told me that you become most creative during the late hours like 0 and 0a. m. I guess this is my creative down-time. Boy, I could sure use a little down-time. Too many things still left to do. Somewhere in here I have to eat dinner. I refuse to eat from the death carts again today. Granted, they do have good eggrolls. But I just don't want figure out what the meat is. Dog would be very bad. I've got a dog, or at least I had a dog. I had to leave him at home. I guess I'll see him at Christmas. I like it how the semester ends at Christmas. Less to worry about over the holidays. Unlike high school. I hated it when teachers would have tests right after long vacations. Not that I did bad on them. It just meant I had to think about the upcoming test for the duration of break. Y'know, it's going to be hard to type all this one-handed. I fractured my finger about a week before class. For the time being my finger is immobilized. You'd be surprised at all the times we use our pinky and take it for granted. It is a very essential finger. Only 0 more weeks or so, and it will be healed. Personally, I can't wait. I've really had an interesting time as a new student. Adapt to college and adapt to the loss of complete hand movement. Which is essentially the loss of my left hand. I wonder how long this is typed. It's 0 pages written. OUCH#@** My leg is asleep. Pins & needles are always a fun sensation. I wonder how much longer it will be till class. Almost there I think. I feel good that I actually completed a paper weeks before the deadline. It's not a first, but it's close. I've decided one thing about UT, PROPNAME hates me. He asked me if I wanted him to search for one of my classes, and of course I said yes. So PROPNAME replied that my class had been added from 0-0. No problem, right?  He neglected to mention p. m. I am no longer enrolled in anthropology. GOOD-BYE AND GOOD LUCK. 
__label__label1 So it's time for me to start writing this assignment and I'm really tired. I've been studying all day and my brain just can't take it     I've decided that the brain must be like a muscle in that if you don't work it out regularly it gets out of shape. Right new my brain’s fat  fat. But that's OK. I've started running and through running I'm going to learn  more self discipline. It's really annoying the way the screen doesn't return automatically I wonder why the heck it doesn't do it. I guess it's some programming error  but surely it can't be hard to do. I've decided that running is just a conversation. One between your body and mind. Your body says ,"Hey I don't  feel very good can we please stop. " And your mind says "I know but we're almost there can you give a little more. Lately when I've been running I have been giving up before my body has too. This is further proof to me that my brain need conditioning. For the past year or 0 I have given up running for Aikido. I've decided to get back into running. Man this isn't very stream of consciousness. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. I seriously doubt it that's one big \ freaking class. But at least I know one pretty girl. Now that I think of it why the heck does this form ask for sex. I mean are they going to do some kind of statistical  analysis or something?  No way what could you do? count words? When I think of psy class I think mostly about the pretty girl I know in there. I'm helping her out with this computer stuff. I wonder if she has a boy friend. I wonder why I care. I sure don't need a girlfriend right now. This is the first  semester of my new life with my new major. Don't need no girly distractions. I about an hour I'm going to see a movie with my home crowd . /We're seeing swingers. I like it because it's a "nice guy" movie. with realistic camera shots. Wow it's already been twelve minutes. Over halfway there. Man I hope the research part of this course doesn't take up too much time. I think it out to be extra credit or something. Maybe they should defray the cost of the course or pay us or something I hate being a free guinea pig How the hell do you spell guinea. I 'm sick of paying fees toot this university. When I was at ORGNAME I didn't have to pay sooo many hidden fees. They always lurking around the corner. Today was a pretty good day . Except for playing the stupid video game before starting this I have been very productive. I went to a habitat for humanity meeting. Maybe I'll start  doing that on Saturdays. I'm hesitant to commit though because this is my new and improved life. I hope my grades improve this semester or I'm just going to have to quit school or something. I'm kind of tired of school. I want to  get my hand on the real world and start making a difference. It’s amazing how much I’ve been using the letter a and how terrible a typing job I have been doing. ,  It’s my roommates keyboard. It’s extra sensitive or something. I wonder why I keep cutting off the middle of words whenever I hit return . You'd think it would bee natural for me to hit return whenever I finish a word My fingers are cold. This room is 00 degrees. Man I wish they'd turn up the air. 
__label__label1 Well, here  I am writing continuously for twenty minutes. The weird thing is that this keyboard is laid out differently than the one I have back home so it makes typing really difficult. Not to mention the fact that yesterday I got a cut on my finger and hitting the I button tends to hurt a little bit. I am a little concerned about coming to the end of this line but apparently it will automatically wrap my words for me. I am going on a trip to the beach tomorrow. Well at least that's the plan. We don't have anywhere to stay not to mention any food. Oh well, it hopefully will be a lot of fun. I am sitting at Mac 0. I wish they had ORGNAME's in here. That would make my life a little easier. The computer in my room crashed and I can do absolutely nothing on it right now. It's weird I have been writing for about five minutes and I am only on my third line. Well I guess that's what long lines will do to you. There were really long lines at the student computer center the other day. MY roommate was such an angel and stood in line for me when I went to class. A girl just walked in to the computer room with headphones on. I think that is a little weird. I guess she likes to listen to music and type at the same time. I guess you can do laser copies in here. I will have to remember that. I went out for coffee last night with my roommate and his girlfriend. It was a lot of fun and I got checked out by someone really cute. I wonder if this computer lady will help me figure out my e-mail in a little bit. Last time I asked she dismissed me very quickly. That shirt reminds me of ORGNAME's. The one a guy walked in here wearing. I really wonder what you are going to learn from me by reading this. Probably that I am very random, (all my friends tell me that) They also tell me I am a crack head. I'm not really, it's just an expression they use for me because I am so random and jump from subject to subject. Don't you think it's weird that we still write stop on stop signs. We could probably save a TON of paint if we didn't and besides who doesn't know that a red octagon means stop. That sounds like a really bad commercial. I have to go to class at 0:00. I feel weird telling people that I am going to Acting class. I feel very pretentious. I really think I am going to like the class though. I have been in theatre since fourth grade I just completely lost my train of thought. It got derailed you could say. I wonder what derailed it? Oh well, I guess that's what you are trying to figure out from me writing this. Life imitates art. I miss PROPNAME PROPNAME. Not really, but she is someone whom I am supposed to miss. I really miss PROPNAME. She is one of my best friends in the world. I called her the other night and when I heard her voice I could do nothing but cry. The computer lady walked by. Apparently she chooses whom she likes to help and who she doesn't. I never know when to use who and whom. I think I am going to save this really quick so that I won't accidentally lose it. Wait never mind that would lose my train of thought. I think it would at least. I really wish I could read some of the other students stream of consciousness papers. I want to see how similar they are to me. Maybe they aren't similar at all and I am the weirdo in the group. That's what my sister would like to have me believe. She pretends that she doesn't miss me but I know she does. I wonder how this whole e-mail thing is going to work. I can't wait to e-mail my dad and PROPNAME. I would e-mail my mom too but I don't know her school e-mail name. It's scary how many e-mail accounts my family has, I think the grand total is eight. Maybe nine. I don't know if my sister has one at school or not. It depends which class she is in. Nine accounts and four people. There are way to many ways to reach us. This is an odd power PC. This computer contains the fonts necessary for the software packages ORGNAME and PROPNAME. I  wonder what those are. Probably some English programs or something. At least that's what the name implies. El tiburon means shark in Spanish. I think there is an accent but I am not so sure. Fireworks are really cool. My mom and I love to go sit under them and feel the booms. A couple of years ago there was a grass fire near where we were sitting. It was kind of exciting. Not something like rescue 000 but still it was interesting for us. I hope you find this interesting and not just some drivel about me. Drivel is such a fun word. It reminds me of dribble. Well, I have to jet. I hope I didn't write for too long but It is fun getting your thoughts out on paper. Like I am doing now, Auggghhhh the insanity. Or sanity, however you want to see it I guess. 
__label__label1 I’m in my apartment with my new desk, everything is finally getting organized. I feel like this year will be a good one, I am not the same person that I used to be. I feel so much more secure. sure there were times when I would see people gathered in a huge group and think to myself that I wanted to join and be a part of it but when it comes right down to it, I am the kind of person who likes to have a couple of really close friends and then a lot of friends who I can say hi to and visit with on occasion. I really believe that that is okay. my boyfriend and I are great, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I don't need to be with him all the time so we enjoy each other's company a lot when we are together because it is not so often. he sees me in a totally different light this year and I feel the same way about him. I wonder if PROPNAME is having a good time tonight with Ira. I think that she is trying to convince herself that she doesn't want any relationships with guys. I wonder if it bothers her that PROPNAME is here. I hope not but I am not going to ban my boyfriend from coming to the apartment just because she doesn't have someone to come see her. I hope that isn't horrible. PROPNAME is going really well. it's going to be a really busy year I can already tell but I think that I can definitely handle it this year, I have the right mind set. the meeting last night was way to long though. who wants to sit in a chair for three hours discussing what seems like today as absolutely nothing!!! it was crazy. so many times I wanted to jump out of my chair and leave the room but I sat there and listened to all of the nonsense. this sorority thing is driving me crazy. on the one hand, it has the potential to be a lot of fun, on the other hand it is a huge time commitment and I am not sure if I want to put myself into something that leaves little time for anything else, on the other hand the old PROPNAME wouldn't get involved at all because she would be too nervous. I don't want to be that PROPNAME anymore. I never realized how hard it would be to write for twenty minutes. I feel like I have said a lot and it has only been ten minutes maybe. my boyfriend is in the other room studying, ha he has to go next. my classes are good this semester. history is going to be boring not because I hate the subject but because I am more interested in a discussion class and 0000 to the Civil War is so long ago and I feel like I studied it to satisfaction in high school. last year at LOCNAME I remember thinking it would be fun to study history again and I was irritated that as a freshman I couldn't take the class, look how times change. I think I am more organized this year than ever before in my life. my walls need paintings though or at least posters, I wonder where I can get cheap ones. I want to buy those glow in the dark stars and planets for my walls too. I think those are great. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. I hope he does better at school this year than he did last year. I am sure he will. he seems to have more control over himself this year. I can't believe he is taking drivers ed. how weird. I am so tired right now. I have so much reading to do. I am not going to sleep until it is all done, I must be prepared this year. I can stop thinking about some song where it says that the hardest to learn is the least complicated. it's hard to learn to study but once you do your life is so easy. I am going to learn that this year. that was an indigo girls song. what a fun concert. I wish they would come back to town. how great it was seeing PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I can't believe I didn't see PROPNAME there. I missed her this summer. she and PROPNAME will work well together I am sure. I am glad he is working at PROPNAME it will be nice spending time with him in that setting. 
__label__label0 Today my aunt PROPNAME came up to visit me. she was on a trip out here for business meetings. She told me a bunch of stories about her life at LOCNAME when she went here 00 years ago. she told that she was almost raped by a serial rapist the police had been trying to catch for two years. He had been stalking her for weeks, and she never even knew. the only other person I knew who this had happened to is a friend of mine who had an abusive boyfriend who would rape her on a daily basis. she's finally doing a lot better, but still has kind of a loser boyfriend. guys are just weird that way. I've been going out with the same guy for close to two and a half years now, and it looks like we might get married!  I'm really excited about that, we've had lots of plans about various things, but I don't know. we want a house and kids and that whole thing. today in art class, one lady had a quilt as her piece to express an emotion and it really brought me that sense of home. It was so pretty, it had a floral design, but also had these powder green and white solid pieces. It really made me feel at home and almost at my grandma's house. she's got a quilt her mother made, and it is about seventy years old. It was made from material of old clothes that no one fit into anymore. Their family was so incredibly poor that they lived out in the countryside, and worked in the fields. my grandmother has told stories of her life, some gruesome and some amazing. she used to be the one to cut off the heads of the chickens they ate, and it was nothing to her just normal. other times she can remember riding through the country side on her horse where there are now huge freeways and shopping centers. I often wonder what it would be like living back then. she gave me a magazine clipping of how life was like as a teacher back then (she was a teacher, and I am going to be a teacher) and I’m am really glad that we are well on our way into the twenty first century!  they used to not be able to be married, have children, they had to go to church every Sunday, clean the classroom at least once a week on their hands and knees with a hand brush, and all these other gruesome things. the only thing I have to worry about are the guns and cuts that go on in the schools (maybe it would be better to go back to the old days, huh?)  I want to be an art teacher, but I’m not sure how that will all work out. my major will allow me to be an artist but with an all-level teaching certificate on the side. so. I can either be a starving artist or a starving teacher!  (both kind of sad)  however, I don't really want to have to be out there working, I’m more of a homebody, and want to be the typical housewife. everyone I know thinks I’m crazy, but that has been my goal (perhaps "dream" is too strong a word) ever since I can remember. I have also wanted five children since the time I was about eight years old. I actually come from a family of four children, so maybe the fifth I want is an unconscious way of somehow "outdoing" my parents. that has often worried me because it's kind of what it sounds like, but I really don't feel that way. my parents were actually the ones who first brought it up, so I don't know. 
__label__label1 I sit in a chair. I wonder . I wonder about life. we have many options. to live, to die, or get cancer. cynical ideas always cross my mind. I question everything that comes my way. anything. why are dachshunds the best dogs to have. I always look for different things. like the outside world. there are some things you just can't reveal. sometimes there are no answers to questions and no questions  can answer. I can't write. I would like to be a screenwriter someday but I can not write complete  thoughts. I am really scatterbrained. I have many ideas but I am afraid that I will fail listen. I always have a ear that listens to weird noises, give me an apple. I would like to eatan apple tonight. tonight is a good a good night. tonight will be never  the same again. there will always be room to live in another night. I hope I can learn how to type faster cause I have many strange and honest thoughts  running through my mind tonight. I will think of why I am writing this. I don't want to think about it cause it will take up too much of my other  ideas. I like to read why people are the way they are. I think every body’s brain I s incredibly strange. infinity is a concept that cloud not be conceived not in this brain, or anybody else’s. some day will the word mean something or will it? that I can not explain or will try to explain or think like I know I can explain. I like to talk to people about their spirituality ideas ideas ideas. I know that I will sleep exceptionally well . I am typing this at night because I was really thinking and I am not able to put all of it on paper. listen to me listen  to me I am rambling. I am a really drained for thinking about my future. I am almost certain that I know what I want to do but  I am afraid of failing and never be able to be happy. I do have confidence, ambition and ] think that I will be successful. I have been writing/typing for at least 00 min. I could go all night but instead I will make my mind ' wander of into some other tangent. 
__label__label0 Well, here we go with the stream of consciousness essay. I used to do things like this in high school sometimes. They were pretty interesting, but I often find myself with a lack of things to say. I normally consider myself someone who gets straight to the point. I wonder if I should hit enter any time to send this back to the front. Maybe I'll fix it later. My friend is playing guitar in my room now. Sort of playing anyway. More like messing with it. He's still learning. There's a drawing on the wall next to me. Comic book characters I think, but I'm not sure who they are. It's been a while since I've kept up with comic's. I just heard a sound from ICQ. That's a chat program on the internet. I don't know too much about it so I can't really explain too well. Anyway, I hope I'm done with this by the time another friend comes over. It will be nice to talk to her again. She went home this weekend for Labor Day. So did my brother. I didn't go. I'm not sure why. No reason to go, I guess. Hmm. when did I start this. Wow, that was a long line. I guess I won't change it later. Okay, I'm running out of things to talk about. I've found that happens to me a lot in conversation. Not a very interesting person, I guess. Well, I don't know. It's something I'm working on. I'm in a class now that might help. The phone just rang. Should I get it?  The guy playing the guitar answered it for me. It's for my roommate. My suitemate just came in and started reading this. I'm uncomfortable with that. He's in the bathroom now. You know, this is a really boring piece of literature. I never realized how dull most everyday thoughts are. Then again, when you keep your mind constantly moving like this, there isn't really time to stop and think deeply about things. I wonder how long this is going to be. I think it's been about ten minutes now. Only my second line. How sad. Well, not really considering how long these lines are. Anyway, I wonder what I'm going to do the rest of the night. I guess there's always homework to do. I guess we'll see. This seat is uncomfortable. My back sort of hurts. I think I'm going to have arthritis when I get older. I always thought that I wouldn't like to grow old. Not too old, I suppose. I've always been a very active person. I have a fear of growing old, I think. I guess it'll go away as I age gradually. I don't know how well I'd deal with paralysis from an accident though. As long as I have God and my friends around, I'll be okay though. I'm pretty thirsty right now. There isn't much to drink around my room. Ultimate Frisbee, I haven't played that all summer. Fun game, but tiring. I'm out of shape. I'd like to get in better shape, but I hate running. It's too dull for me. Hmmm. it's almost over now. Just a few more minutes. Let's see if I make it to the next line. Short reachable goals!  Whatever. Anyway, what else do I have to do tonight. I guess I could read some. My shirt smells like dinner. It's pretty disgusting. I need to wake up for a 0:00 am class tomorrow. I remember when that wasn't early at all. Well, I made it to the next line. I'm so proud of myself. That's sarcasm, by the way. I wonder if I was suppose to right this thing as a narrative. Oh well too late now. Time for me to head out. Until next time, good bye and good luck. I don't know. 
__label__label0 I'm so glad PROPNAME, my roommate, just left to see PROPNAME, a guy she has liked for quite some time now. I think they should get together as more than friends, but sometimes that just doesn't work. I remember a time when a friend of mine turned out liking me as more. I don't know why this computer always makes some kind of noise like it's starting up even when I’m not using it. Someone is very loud in the hall. They sound like they are having fun. wish I could join them. Is PROPNAME thinking about me right now?  I wonder were he is and if he loves me the way he says he does. I wish I was a better typist. There is so much chemistry I need to be doing. Is there a party in the next room?  PROPNAME just walked in. is he up to something?  This room is kind of hot and I could really drink something cold right now. I just hate people who expect me to understand them when they're speaking a language I don't know. French wouldn't be bad to learn, though. Wish I was at LOCNAME LOCNAME right now. I just saw PROPNAME and PROPNAME on my shelf and remember the great summer we had there. Well mom and dad were fun, but PROPNAME was a royal pain in the butt. I even have Chip and PROPNAME wallpaper on my PC. gosh, am I a fanatic or what. I think I just know a good thing when I see one. Speaking of good things, I wish I was good at chemistry so I wouldn't have to study the rest of the night and early into the morning. I don't think I'm doing this assignment right because I'm now to the point where I'm thinking of things to say. sitting at this desk is not comfortable at all. My hair is in my face and I wish it was alot longer than it is so I could pull it back. Jester is not a bad place to live except for the constant interruptions. This comp is a pain because the mouse is built in and I always hit it when typing. Who keeps slamming those doors. Doesn't anyone have homework besides me. I put too much pressure on myself to make my parents proud of me. This coo-coo clock on my comp just made a noise and the bird, PROPNAME is so cute nose itches. it always does. Does that really mean that someone is thinking about me. If it's true I hope it's PROPNAME. I wonder where he is now. Is he going to call me soon. When I get through with this I need to check my e-mail to see if anyone is trying to get a hold of me. I miss PROPNAME. She's the only friend I can really tell things to. If she came up to UT I would never get any of my homework done. But then again she would spend alot of time with my brother. He treats her so bad. I don't know why she puts up with it. I always wondered why people couldn't answer when I asked them what they were thinking. This assignment proves there is always something on your mind. I just hit the home key and it took me to the beginning of this writing and I wasn't smart enough to figure out to hit the end key until I scrolled all the way through what I just wrote. If I could type faster this assignment would flow a lot more smoothly and I wouldn't lose any of my thoughts while typing previous ones. I wonder how long it's been. The way I'm sitting here is hurting my back. I can't believe I wrecked my car and got whiplash. It's been two months and I'm still doped up. I can't even carry a bookbag without it hurting. It sounds like there is a guy talking outside my window but that is not possible because I'm on the tenth floor. It's been almost twenty minutes but this is kind of fun. I should do this more often. It got my mind off of chem for a while and relieved some of my stress. I'm such a basket case anyway, I worry way too much about stuff that I end up doing just fine on. The phone is ringing in the other room. I wonder when PROPNAME is going to call me. If I didn't worry about him so much and worried about chem a little more I probably wouldn't hate it so much. I can't wait to go to the frat party this weekend. There are so many guys there that want to go out with me. I wonder if that's true or if PROPNAME just said that to flatter me or to make himself believe that he has a beautiful girlfriend. Oh I'm so bad, I've only known him for a little while and I'm already second guessing him. He is actually the best guy I've had in a while. He is so smart. how sexy. That guy is still talking outside of my window. I guess I shouldn't be correcting my mistakes when typing but even my friends say I'm a bit of a perfectionist. 
__label__label0 Why am I doing this assignment?  I do not want to be here? I think I want to go to sleep. I wish PROPNAME would shut up so I could do my homework. When I play basketball I wish PROPNAME would pass me the ball. But he never passes the ball so why am I complaining. My wrists hurts because the keyboard is in the wrong position. But I will not say anything because this is not my computer. I hate this keyboard because the keyboard is sorry. I wish I could go to sleep. But then again I never sleep. I wish PROPNAME would get out of this room. Why did I come here?  I wish I stayed in LOCNAME. PROPNAME needs to leave now. But he will never leave because he is going to sit down and talk. Kind of like what he is doing know. I hate this song . They play this song way too much. When are they going to leave. I wish PROPNAME would turn off his computer and stop playing the music. I wish this assignment could be shorter but then again the is homework so it is not supposed to be fun. I wish I brought my own computer but I don't care. PROPNAME needs to shut up. PROPNAME is talking to one of his many girls. He has so many that people call him the mack. The computer is going to be burnt out by the time I am done with this assignment. PROPNAME better leave or I will have to beat him up. Luckily PROPNAME left so I do not have to beat him up. I think my friends listen to more Korean music then I do. God I wish I could get off this computer but I have to stay on here for a while. The reason is because I have to study for my chemistry quiz tomorrow. Hopefully it will be easy because I do not know what is going on in that class. I need to go talk to the chemistry department about switching my chemistry teachers. Hopefully they will let me because I have no clue on what is going on. Today I ate some lunch around eleven o'clock. Yes the food was nasty because it was from Jester. I think they intentionally make the food here disgusting so that we will stop eating and study more. But I don't think so because everybody winds up either working out or playing basketball. I wish they would turn off this music because sound gay. Anyway when is this assignment going to end. I really need to go study for my chemistry class. I just need to type for about ten more minutes. I wonder who this song is by?  Then again why did I care it is stupid. I need to talk to someone but I lost their number so I guess I won't have my blanket. I need to find that guys number but I lost it so I guess I will never find it. I hate HOT I think they are gay . So I do not know why PROPNAME is listening to it. I wish I could take these speakers and just break them because they are so gay. Why doesn’t he listen to some other music that sounds better. I wish I could go back home and drive my car. I miss driving my car. I got a ORGNAME Civic. It is silver and it is all mine. I am thinking about bringing it up next semester. I wish they would turn this music off but then again why do I care. I wish they would play some Tupac or Snoop. I have two more minutes. I wish the two minute would go by faster. I need to get some carpet for my room . I'm thinking about switching my major. I might go to business or I might just stick Psychology and try to go into physical therapy after I finish college. I have one more minute left and then I am done. Toad is stupid. I hate Puff Daddy this song is sop overplayed. 
__label__label1 wanna see the real you- I love this song. by the suicide machines. I saw them last spring break with the descendents. good show. now green world is on. this is weird, trying to write continuously for 00 minutes. you tend to think  differently when you're forced to. like today, those questionnaires in psych class. I think I analyzed them too much and tricked myself into answering  differently. oh well. I have a lot of shit I need to be doing like returning that journalism book and buying the packet for that class. that class sucks. how  can journalists shove a camera and microphone in someone’s face when they’re in mourning or whatever. and those guys who caused the princess Di's wreck just for some pictures. it makes me sick. do they have no feelings or sympathy  whatsoever? does anyone? how the hell am I going to find a job that I like that doesn’t require making it to the top, no matter who you step on to get there. I guess all jobs are like that I’m just not a competitive person at all. never was. I don’t need to put other people down or be the best at everything in order to feel good or proud like tough guys. sure I’m proud of what I can do but I could  never hurt another soul doing it. well the music’s off now and its quiet here in  my castilian dorm room except for the fan. my boyfriend and my friends are  upstairs, probably watching t. v. I wonder if he wants to go to that less than  PROPNAME show tonight I want to. they’re pretty good. my back hurts. I need to go  to a chiropractor cant believe this stuff going through my head. how boring. I do think about interesting things sometimes. a few nights ago my boyfriend (PROPNAME) and me and three other girls got into a huge (drunk) argument about  how the world would be different if women were in all power. then we starting  arguing, are gender differences biological or environmental? kevin thinks  they’re environmental, and has a nerdy, stubborn, math/scientist guy and shows  very little emotions. marita and I said no, its about 00/00, because women are  born with these instincts that men will never know until they grow uteruses  and give birth. ok I have 0 more minutes to write. my hair feels weird. I cut  about a foot off 0 days ago. it was down to my waist now its to my chin. I feel  bald. I wonder if I should dye it again. last year it was purple. man I’m doing  it again, rambling on about boring stupid shit. I wonder if everyone else  sounds as dumb as me, chatting away about stuff nobody really cares  about. for twenty minutes. all to make a good grade. why is so much emphasis  placed on grades I wonder. they don’t measure your intelligence. some people  always do their homework and make good grades. that me. some people study and  study but still bomb tests. that’s me too. tests suck. especially true false  questions. I analyze those too much until I confuse myself. kevin doesn’t have to  study and aces every test. no fair. well looks like my time is up. if anyone  actually read this, sorry. fun job huh. I guess you’ve read much weirder  stuff than this anyway. well adios. 
__label__label1 Stream Of Consciousness      As I sit behind this bleak, gray screen, I find myself wanting to yank my  dirty blonde locks of hair right out of their follicles. Sure, so far college has been a lot of fun. Why doesn't this program allow me to scroll down to  the next line without pushing "enter"? Am I supposed to keep on typing without pushing "enter" until I hit some kind of barrier and can't type anymore?  Well,  I'm going to operate on the assumption that I should make my own right margin. Back to being completely stressed, I have so many things that I have to do  right now, that is, before tomorrow. So, why the heck am I doing this  assignment when I have until the 00th to turn it in?  I guess that's my nature. I tend to want to do the "fun" things first. If my mother could see me now, she would freak. I wonder what would happen if I got my upper ear pierced?  I bet my mom would kill me. She nearly freaked out when I had my belly button pierced. I feel extremely guilty for having done that behind her back, but I  feel even more guilty for upsetting her and ruining my innocence in her eyes. My roommate wants me to pierce her ear for her. I honestly don't think that I am capable of inflicting that kind of pain on another individual. Sure, I can  pierce my own bellybutton, but when I see another person in pain, I feel twice as bad as they most likely do. Oh well, I'll just give Tracy the money to go  have it professionally done. This pushing "enter" is really beginning to  frustrate me. I keep typing way over the right limit and having to erase and go back and re-type what I already typed. I think I need a computer. I  hate having to work and concentrate amongst all the hundreds of other people  here at the SMF (the Smurf. I smile everytime I hear that). I wanted to buy a computer, and I do have the money since I sold my motorcycle, not by my own  choice, but by my mothers. I realize that was a run-on sentence, but I'm not  about to go back and fix it. I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this or not. I'm just glad that I haven't had any demented thoughts since I have  started typing. Not that I have those often, but we all have certain weird  thoughts that we really don't care to admit having. At least, I hope so. I  bet whoever reads this is going to think that I'm a bad person. I'm really not. I like to think of myself as daring and thrill seeking. My mother likes to  think of me as unconventional and improper and borderline ignorant. So, here I am at UT to prove her wrong. I've taken a step in the right direction by joining a sorority. I think that should be fun as long as I can stay on the  good side of the girls in the sorority. It has been my experience that after  anyone has known me for a long enough period of time, they grow tired of my companionship and toss me aside like yesterday's trash. This is one of the most confusing and hurtful things in my life. I don't understand it. I think I'm  the nicest person that I know. I'm always willing to do things for others to  make them happy. I'm a great listener, and I put everything I've got into  everything that I do (friendships especially). I've been told that things will  change and that things will get better in college. So far, I've found that to  be very true. I've met so many wonderful people that I can't wait to know  better, but the first 00 years of my life has me trained to wonder how long it will be before they drop me. Oh well. my twenty minutes is almost over with and I have successfully typed myself into a foul mood. I really hope  no one reads this. I'm going to leave the Smurf, go back to Castilian and  enjoy being with my new friends while they still like me!    
__label__label1 Today has been the worst and most stressful day ever. All I want is for  something to go right!  I tried to dot his paper about thirty seconds ago but it didn't work because again I've messed something up! I was talking about this in my last stream of consciousness paper that I thought was gone but realized after I had erased half o of it that it was really still there! AAhhh!  Can something please go right?   My Ethernet card was not properly packaged and is causing me and a few others serious drama because we've all been trying to make it work for four days now. I don't even know if I'm supposed to push enter when I get near the end of the line but I figure better safe than sorry as far as grades go. I just looked at the clock and I've only been writing for four minutes. Why does time go  by so slowly when it counts. Speaking of timing, mine is the worst!  I always like guys either before or after they like me but never while they like me. Whenever I like a guy I'm to shy, stupid, scared,  immature to let him know, and by the time or if he likes me I have lost interest!  Or they never have interest in the first place and I find that challenging and will pursue that guy instead  of the  one who likes me!  Or in one case I'll find out that after liking me four two straight years, he decides to change sex preferences when I like him. AHHH!  Actually I had my chance and now I'll have to live with regret forever, or until he wants an opposite sex relationship!  Ten minutes to go and I'm running out of self-deprecating and embarrassing stories of my miserable unromantic life! I want someone who respects the fact that I'm not a traditional female and that likes my odd sense of humor and is also funny himself and finds me attractive. . Which reminds me as I look above my roommate’s computer of another guy who I let slip through the cracks Even though there was a slim chance of anything ever happening, I never acted on my feelings,  Wait a minute I did spill my guts while playing truth or dare with him and other friends. I wish I could play truth or dare with the other guy I like(d) so that he'll know that it was me and not him that kept us ;apart, I liked you then and I liked you up until I found out there was no chance for us and I resented you a little!  Someday I'll get up the courage to tell him!  It is about twenty degrees Fahrenheit in my lovely room in LOCNAME LOCNAME on the tenth floor. The air Conditioning vent is blowing right in my face as I type. I have been having stomach problems all day, and they are starting to resurface,  I almost passed  out at the draw for the football game against ORGNAME this Saturday, I refuse to paint my face half orange and half white as my roommate hopes I will. One minute to go and I'm starting to feel relieved that I wont have to think about this particular assignment ever again. Five percent of my grade is secured and pretty soon I'll be doing those psych experiments and that will be easy too. I'm majoring in psychology but I used to want to be an architect. Oops, I got carried away and wrote one minute over, now it is two. 
__label__label0 My thoughts, sensations, and emotions are always changing with each new experience, idea, and whatever happens throughout my life. They are affected sometimes by what other people think and sometimes affected from just maturing and thinking differently. Right now I feel like I am in control of myself because I am doing well in school academically, socially, and mentally. School work is very important to me and I make sure that I do well. I don't go overboard like a lot of my friends who study hours every day. Socially, I have adapted very well in meeting new friends. Mentally, I am in control and focused on what is going on in my life. There were some problems that have caused some stress in my life since college started. First, me and my roommate got in some petty arguments, but now we are getting along just fine. Also, I had some guy problems. I regretted doing some things I knew I shouldn't have done, but now we worked things out and or friendship is even better than before. I know that I haven't been eating right and sleeping enough, which is causing some changes in my body that cause me to be more tired and weak. I always go to sleep way too late and wake up early for my classes. Last night a friend called at two in the morning and I talked to him for hours even though I should have y eight-o-clock class. I am in a very good mood today because everything seems to be working out for me. I'm usually a nice pleasant person until I am faced with a lot of stress or go through PMS. Then I get in a really bad mood. My friends know when to stay away from me. The only thing really troubling me right now is all the reading I have to do for my classes. the assignments they give us are no problem, but the reading is crazy. They bombard us with reading assignments that  really aren't necessary. My art class, for instance, requires for the present moment for me to read from pages 00 to 000-something. I really don't want to read about all these statues and paintings and sculptures from different eras. Anyway, I miss my family, but I'm not homesick at all. How can I be when my parents call ALL the time?  I know they care for me, but it's really not necessary for them to want to visit every weekend, which I won't allow them to do. That sounds mean, but they're going to have to get used to it. I do miss the free laundry and the home-cooked meals and my own room and my nice bathroom, but oh well.                     
__label__label0 Well it's hard to pinpoint my first thought as I begin to write, as it would be hard to pinpoint one thought that I have at any one time. I think constantly, usually about things that I should or shouldn't be doing at that time. For example, I constantly think about things I should be doing to help myself apply for medical school, like joining organizations, volunteering at hospitals, or studying to have that 0. 0 or higher. It seems like I'm always on the go now. This summer was pretty leisurely ORGNAME then I move down here and I try to work the same hours taking 00 hours instead of 0. It's not the best thing for the soul. Speaking of soul, I try to go to church when I can and I feel guilty when I don't, but I haven't found the chance to go yet. And I hate making excuses, but I do a lot. I just watched a TV show on ORGNAME called LOCNAME LOCNAME or something like that. It really excited me because I'm from a really small town, which  I don't think ever makes the news. I have been really impressed with ORGNAME and ORGNAME so far. All my professors have been great and I can learn from their lectures. I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME for two years, where I had to learn most things on my own. I transferred with Express and it is a lot harder down here. The manager is a lot stricter; I can't lean!  I'm going to cut my hair off this Friday, but I don't know if I should. But, on the other hand, my hair causes me to get really hot and sweaty. I have already made the appointment, so I guess I will go through with it. I can't imagine how boring this must be for y’all to read,  but I guess it could get pretty interesting depending on the students  I guess you can tell how confused I am all the time. It shows in my writing how often my thoughts conflict one right after the other. Writing this hasn't taught me that though, I already knew I was confused. 
__label__label1 I have been typing friends and family for a while now, and I noticed today that my most creative writing is then!  When I have no worries, no cares, and just let go of all those ideas that I keep losing when it comes to the time when your dreaded English class requires a ten page paper. < and I'm wondering why this line will not stop, this page must be really long!  Wow, or the typing very small.  (Deep breath), the guy next to me just passed out onto his keyboard but- up(!) he's okay. Back to the computer idea. I believe that sometimes computers get mad at me for figuring them out, so they crap out completely. Just simply have no cure at all. The one story I want to tell is short and sweet, but a little scary. IT is the reason why I thought I'd never use a computer again, but I went against my promises, and forced myself to join this growing, technological world once again. This is really difficult. I wasn't going to write this in the LAB, but I have a large space of time between my two classes today, a four-hour space. Which is good, I do believe. I think that there are some people at the LABs who are a little too curious about what is being written on computers next to them. Ya know, "I wonder what other people are up to?"  I admit that I've looked at a few words typed up on someone else's screen, but not as rudely as the guy who is sitting next to me. Possibly, if I tell him straight out, he'll stop, but, nope, I'm a little too shy for that. I think he'll catch on if he reads this. GET A LIFE! no, that is a little cruel. I actually have changed my mind. You can read my screen if you want.  I changed my mind after I saw the movie "DREAM WITH THE FISHES" very good movie. It won't be out on the screen by the time you read this I don't think. I may actually be gone by then too. I wonder. How can you stand reading -actually, I changed my mind. I'd enjoy reading people's true odd thoughts. But I like to put a visual subject to their writing, I like to know what their appearance is. I ask myself, is that wrong to want to know what that person looks like?  I really don't give a shit about what I look like once I'm out in public, but -I got off the whole point-  Some people's beliefs have to be proven by their actions, and sometimes their actions will be expressed through the appearance. These are such strong words that can honestly screw someone over; especially if they are into politics.  What the hell, I need to read back and see what I was aiming for. Oh, the guy who likes to read the screen, and the movie (!) it's time to compare and contrast. In "Dream with the Fishes", one of the two main characters, the one who's point of view is taken throughout the movie, he is a very simple, depressed, and desperate, business man. His favorite pastime (which the second character made him admit to him) was looking at people through his binoculars, through the city windows, across to the apartment buildings. This is a really good movie, I suggest seeing it. Okay, I'm going scatter again. Well, the second character knew all along that the business man watched him, but didn't mind. He knew that it was all the business man had, so he let him. This was not the main portion of the movie or anything, it's not that dull, it was just a simple twist to make the movie a little more unique. That brings me to another point, why must people spend so much time making movies which resemble fifty other movies?  Maybe a hundred or more?  I don't even bother to go to the ones with same plots, or no plots. But I AM a movie freak!  I might even want to get into that someday. I'll have to improve on my grammar a bit, and get used to being in the dark a lot, with fictional, or replayed stories being projected in front of me. I COULD do that. But I think my interests will take their own path, according to availability. Oh!  I just remembered that I need to get some toothpaste, and possibly some other stuff, but being a typical college student, I think I can only afford toothpaste. I HAVE noticed around here that these kids around me are very rich actually. (with a sly movement of the eyebrow)  What's up with that?  This is supposed to be real life right?  Well, another form of real life just growled at me, I'm starving, and must go. Thank you very much if you read this. You know a few secrets which I would tell no one. Well, not real individual secrets, just train of thought that I would never admit to someone else. And although you have my name, it's no matter cause I don't know who you are. See ya 
__label__label0 This is really strange. I have never had to do anything like this assignment in my life. Actually the only time I ever use a computer is to play solitaire. I took a couple of computer classes in high school but never learned anything about the internet. I went after class today to set up the computer account but the office had already shut down. I was able to set up an e-mail address but I just learned that I can't do much with it just yet. I never set up an account with the university so I can't check my mail from the apartment just yet. I came into the computer lab in my apartment complex and fortunately a guy in here kind of helped me to understand what is going on with the computer situation. He let me use his account to do this writing assignment with one restriction-I can't do anything illegal while I am logged into his account. The funny thing is I would not know if I was doing anything illegal because I know nothing about computers. I think before I go to class tomorrow I am going to set up my account at school. Maybe the people in the PROPNAME building will have some handouts for the "computer illiterate". I wonder if I am the first person to do this assignment. Probably not, there was only about 000 people in my class and I am sure someone has done the assignment by now. I figured I should do it ASAP so I won't fall behind in my homework assignments. I was a pretty good student in high school but then again I was always reminded when assignments were due. I already have post-it notes all over my room to remind me of the things I have to do for all my classes. There is a pool right outside of the computer lab I am sitting at and I am thinking I may have to go swimming. I think I will invite some friends over to keep me company. It is really cold in here and my fingers are beginning to freeze up. I am in here alone. The song to "Friends" is playing loudly on the TV in the sitting room next door. A girl who works in the office just shut the door and said "Good Night". It is quieter now and I am beginning to run out of things to type about. I talked to my boyfriend right before I came over here. He goes to Ole Miss in LOCNAME. I haven't talked to him in a few days so it was nice to hear his voice. He has an e-mail address so I think I am going to attempt to e-mail him. I wonder if anyone will read all of this stuff I just wrote. I think with over 0000 entries due it is not too likely someone is going to read this entry. Oh well I have written a little longer than the set amount of time - "Little" being the key word. I am sure with all of the computer technology whoever checks this assignment will know exactly how long I have been typing. I suppose after I set up my account at school I will be able to write my second assignment. I will talk to you then!!  PROPNAME PROPNAME  
__label__label1 I want to start with a simple color. Let's say blue. When I think of blue I think of the ocean and where I live. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. It's "on the border by the sea"  That's like the LOCNAME saying. I also think of baby blankets, actually my baby blanket. This leads me to thinking about a LOCNAME LOCNAME song entitled "Baby Blue". It's a song about his daughter that passed away in a car accident. He's describing her eyes and what he thinks about every day. That has to be hard to deal with. A death in the family is such a detrimental thing to cope with. Fortunately my family has never had an immediate family member pass away. The closest I've been to a loved one that has died, was my great-grandmother. I've also had my girlfriend lose her great-grandmother and her grandmother right after each other. I went to those funerals. I really don't like them very much, It's extremely sad for all the loved ones mourning the death. I guess this leads me to thinking about the color black. It's weird that people usually associate things or ideas to color. I guess it's because we're such a vivid creature. Our vision capabilities are quite advanced when compared to those of other animals. We, humans, are able to see most of the spectrum, all we cant see is the ultra-violet end and the, oh I forgot, I think it's the infer red side as well. We might excel in vision, but are still very primitive in the sense of smell. When we compare our smelling to that of canines, all I can say is that they are able to smell around 000-0000 times better than us. Back to black. Jet Black is favorite color, or at least it used to be. I really enjoy viewing the colors of nature. I have found myself buying shirts the colors of nature. Like a dirt/green or pale/orange, light/yellow or sky/blue, the color of soil. I love the smell of the earth after it rains, it smells so pure, rich, I guess I associate that smell to nature. Imagine what a dog smells after it rains. Now that's something I wish I could take a whiff of. That's around 00 min. of writing. I want to say that this has been a great experience for me. It calmed me down from this hurried morning. I feel more at ease with myself, but I can't explain why. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this little talk with me. I know I'm not supposed to use "you" when writing a paper, but the instructions say that it's alright to fib a little in my grammar. Sorry for any misunderstandings. "Good-bye and Good-luck. " 
__label__label0 As I write this paper I am still filled with the stress, but know gets much worse. I have been hired for a job, and I am still pondering if it is possible to handle both a job and school. I guess you can call it greed about money, but I need it to stay here. I am also thinking that this to easy. College is supposed to be hard, and yet my hardest class is my Microeconomics. With all this stress I still have the one thought in my head. What if I was not born?  Would it be less stressful?  This is not a suicide letter, but the thought of me not being born always enters my mind. Is life nothing but work and school, or is it much more. I do not know I guess I am always thinking about the negative aspects of life. The world is not like peaches and cream. Tonight is a busy night. I have to do my laundry, and do some reading. I guess I am psyching myself out. And yet I am alone in a city that is surrounded by my burden. I do not know what the point of writing this. I guess I need the grade, but even then I wish why I can not be truly happy about my life. To think that some where around the world somebody is happy, and it makes me sick to think about that. Life is not fun and games it is a weary journey that must be gone through, but I can't rest my feet until I am done and gone. 
__label__label0 I'm pissed. I just sat here for twenty fuckin' minutes thinking I'm all bad ass and shit, trying to do this assignment and all along I was doing it wrong. Oh well, I really shouldn’t be cussing. I find this rather relaxing in a way. I'm feeling lazy the last couple of days have been very draggy. So right now I'm thinking that I'm a fat, short girl with a high self esteem is that possible? Anyway right now I'm feeling let me think of what I am feeling. I'm feeling exited because I get to go home this weekend. I get to see my boyfriend and family. I was just noticing that I worded that differently. Wrong it's family and boyfriend. I haven’t been home in a while, so it will be great to eat some home cooked food. So do you get some freaked out nutcases in these assignment? I meant to put an 's' but I was too lazy to go back. Yesterday I killed my roommate and her soul will be back to haunt me as I sleep. She was a weird little bitch anyway. I got the kitchen knife and stuck it in her head. I didn't like her head anyway. It was weirdish. And of coarse I'm just joking. I am a pathological, no compulsive liar. Right now I hate my stomach it sucks because it is so damn huge. You see I’m pregnant and it gets in the way sometimes, all the time. That is why I have not been home in such a long time. My dad would strangle me. Yeah so my boyfriend and I had a fling  one night, an unprotected fling and this is how I got in trouble. He then left me because he couldn’t handle the publicity, it would be bead for him. seeing as how he's a politician and all his wife would freak, so I got myself a new boyfriend and now he believes that the baby is his. Men are so dumb!!!!!!!! My roommate is always forgetting shit, it's fuckin' annoying the hell out of me I mean you can't carry a fuckin' convo. with the girl I wish   could kick her ass right here in front of all these ugly people. They can't stop me I'm mega bitch. She wants to go into mass comm. This is my message to her "GOOD fuckin' luck!!!!!!!!" oh well, I’m calm now. well, I was going to go on but it has been twenty minutes . Yes   type very very slow. 
__label__label1 it seems to me that the purpose of this assignment is not really to examine our mundane thoughts that we perceive but the logic behind the way our mind thinks. Since most my time is spent analyzing my thoughts and their processes I think that I must examine more of the logical progression.       This entry to me simulates making an entry into my journal. I look at that and realize that everything in their is exactly what you want. The most interesting things that I think about and that lead into other realms our my interactions with other people. Today at dinner I saw my ex-girlfriend from high school. she wasn't just a high school crush but the relationship lasted for over a year. After our break up things went down hill to the point that we don't ever talk to each other any more. She sat down with my roommate because she was with a mutual friend of ours. it is odd the way that the alliances from my old group of friends turned out. my roommate and I  can see because we have been friends for a long time and we never ran into the point where there was never any conflict between us. One of my other friends who I used to love more than any other person in the world is still a good friend but not quite ion the same level as we were once on(over my girlfriend we separated because he had just broken up weigh her a month earlier.     That brings up a question that everyone tries to answer:  Is friendship or a relationship more important?  all three of us were best friends but I bet with my ex that we could go to a higher level and stay there. The question that developed inside was it really a different level or another aspect of the same. I almost lost a lot of my friends for her, but those friends are the only ones still around.     I wonder if this philosophy or psych?  Does it really matter. The problem I think with a lot sciences now days is that the focus is so small that their lack of background in other subjects prevents us as moving as far as we might. How can a man consider himself able to study minds without the back ground of the philosopher. He must have explored his own thought and beliefs enough if is to ever have the hope of trying to understand others. Schools inside psych seen contradictory. How can one just study the physiological aspect without considering the developmental. Psych in its self probably should not be a major but the aspiration of the one who would devote himself to biology, philosophy, and sociology. The thing that irks about most of psych is that they seem to indoctrinate their own school of thought onto the tablet of their students mind. I believe in an approach that provides the conflicting theories in order to allow the student to make up his own mind.   The problems with a lot of classes and student is that they do not teach the children the ability to come up with conclusions for themselves. How is the man who can purely memorize the data of other smart. he is a machine that must have data read in to perform a certain task. Those that can create an idea or image to provide those others is the one who deserves praise. He is the man who provides others with everything they receive in life. Even in the arts we have gotten to the point where it is simply regurgitating knowledge instead of creating it. Those students who take band tell me they have a hard improvising because they were just taught to read the music.     The door to true knowledge is creativity and self-examination. 
__label__label0 After the first day ORGNAME class, I went to my dorm room and tried to sit down and do this assignment. To my luck, I was unable to get connected to this address. Oh well. my sister id talking to me right now. she actually thinks I’m listening to her. I guess that is why I am a theater major. right now she's reading me The Principal from the LOCNAME LOCNAME. My sister is a special education teacher in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. We are at my mom's elementary school, in her office. She happens to be a Principal. The reason I’m back at home this fine labor day weekend is because I was unfortunate enough to be born in September. Yes I am still seventeen. Back to what I was thinking about. oh yeah I am home now because I need to have my parent's permission to do the experimental research for this class. I am going back to school on Monday. I feel bad leaving my room in such a mess, but my roommate went to fort worth to visit her best friend at ORGNAME. PROPNAME is her name. She is not having such a grand time at school so she convinced PROPNAME, my roommate, to go up there and visit her. Well I only have ten minutes left to type. I am so glad you don't plan to read these assignments because the typographical errors are plentiful. My sister is such a dork. she is singing everything that she would normally speak. She graduated from the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. (along with her husband)  She keeps asking me if I am excited about going to school at LOCNAME. Of course I am. She wishes she had majored in Theatre. Don't get me wrong she loves teaching, but her first love was the theatre. I need to get organized. I still haven't called my friends to go hang out with them, and I have been home for a couple of days now. I have no idea why I haven't called. Maybe it's because I know I have a lot of things to do such as homework, or laundry, or last minute items to buy from ORGNAME. It has nothing to do with not wanting to see them. I guess well I don't know . I guess that's why I am in this psychology class. I always wanted to take psychology in high school, but I never had time to take in my schedule. The psychology teacher was also my honors English teacher my sophomore year. She was a pretty cool lady. Well twenty minutes have passed and as much as I would like to continue chatting with you, but I have a lot of other homework to do. I am also very tired. I stayed up half the night . IT was a sad night learning of Princess PROPNAME's death. I have the chills.  
__label__label0 I’m feeling a little stress coming on now, because I’m think about everything  I have to do, but have yet to start it. sometimes I can't resist going out with  friends and that is really bad, because then I don't have time to study. I  don't know what else I’m feeling right now. I’m just sitting in front of a  computer in the pcl and typing along. even though the paper doesn't not need correct spelling and stuff, I still go back and correct it(I guess cause it's a  habit). right now I’m observing people as they walk by. I really enjoy this  assignment, because it helps me to put all my thoughts and feelings on paper,  instead of holding them in ( as what I normally do)  I generally don't like to  tell people my feelings inside, I guess cause I’m very paranoid and I don't  trust others with my personal secrets, even if they were really close friends  of mine. I can't wait until later(0:00p. m. when I go practice my throwing of  footballs. I’m really excited about intramural football. most of the people  on my team are really nice. I’m just a little scared about the real games b/c  I’m afraid that the guys on the other coed I’m teams will run into me and hurt  me. I was really sore this morning, after I woke up b/c of football practice  yesterday morning. football practice was pretty fun. I enjoy going through  all the drills and practices. at first I wasn't too sure about playing I’m  football, but when one of my friends asked me to join her team I was like sure. our team makeup is kinda funny. we have all upperclassmen guys and mainly freshman girls. I just thought that was kinda interesting. well, I’m looking  at the clock and it seems like I have five more minutes of writing time. right after I do this assignment, I’m going to go study on the fourth floor. I really don't want to be left behind in my classes. I already am and that's  not a good way to start off my college years. in high school I studied  constantly and now I rarely get to study b/c there is so much stuff going on  and I usually give in to my friends when they want to go do something. I  think time really does fly by. before I know it, it's time to go to sleep again I wish I had nothing to worry about. I always wondered what my life would be like  if I was rich. it would be much more relaxing I think. well, it's already been  twenty minutes and I would write longer, but I really have got to go studying. I can't wait until I get to write paper 0, because I have a lot to say about my  college experience so far. 
__label__label1 I'm feeling a little tired right now. I usually don't suffer from severe lack of sleep as I have this weekend. It's pretty interesting the way it affects my ability to concentrate. I feel like I don't read as well or  communicate ideas as well. This is really a weird assignment but I feel  like I would be taking the easy way out if I were to sit here and dwell  on that for twenty minutes so here goes. Someone is tapping on a table  or something in the next room. I hate it when people make a big ruckus  doing something like that and then they can't even keep a beat. Something I think is interesting is the way people can become dependent on new  technology in a matter of months. When my roommate and I first moved here to LOCNAME we didn't have e-mail capabilities at first and I felt  completely cut off from the outside world. I was so relieved when we  were finally back online. I just figured out what that tapping was. It's  my roommate playing electric bass but it's not plugged in so there isn't  much pitch distinction. Like I always say: bass should be felt not heard. Speaking of my roommate, everyone has told me that it's a bad idea to live  with a friend at college and I think they were right. It's not that I don't like the guy. It's just that his annoying traits got magnified tenfold as  soon as we moved into a 00 foot by 0 foot room. Some friends came down from my hometown this weekend. Their visit made me  realize that as soon as I left for college, everything changed. Most of my relationships with people have been faded a little by the move and I'm sure it's an ongoing process. There are a couple of people, however that I actually feel closer too and surprisingly they're not here in LOCNAME with me. I'm still trying to understand that. I guess when you're separated  from people by large distances, you kind of sort things out in your head and figure out who and what is important. It's like post traumatic  prioritizing. Ok, I think I've said what needed (or didn't need) to be said. 
__label__label0 Right now I am tired and I am thinking about going to bed. I imagine what my classes will be like in thew morning and that I have to get up at 0:00 to be  ready on time for my Astronomy class. I think if I have any home work or stuff  that I have to have done for class. I then think of my next class which is Psychology. I think if I have any preparation I need to do for that class. I then think about what I'm gonna eat for breakfast and then for lunch. I then think that I need to go to the Microcenter  to get the software I need for my business classes. I am disrupted by one of my friends who call me on ORGNAME. I talk to him for a few minutes and then get back to writing. I then immediately receive a phone call  and I talk on the phone for about 0 min. Then I begin to worry how long I've been typing for and I try to remember when I started. I feel that it is time to go to bed so I decide to submit  the assignment. 
__label__label1 I'm sitting here typing again I’ve got a lot to do today I want to get all of my work done soon so I don't have to worry about anything this weekend but I probably will anyway cause I always do. I wish I was a speed reader like on this movie I once saw -my stepmother’s an alien- where the alien just stuck her arm in a book and in a matter of minutes she understood the entire content. if I could do that I would have so much free time to write and draw and relax . I’m sure though that there are people who read slower than me. so maybe I should feel lucky. my wrists hurt again. and my head hurts kind of dizzy tiredness that I have to day from of course not sleeping enough last night. was on the phone instead because some times- especially when your tired and missing your friends- it feels like the right decision to sacrifice sleep for conversational anecdotes. but in the morning and now I feel it may have been a mistake I’ll feel better tomorrow. after I sleep it will be nice to see PROPNAME tomorrow. PROPNAME is so funny -all the porn off his computer sticks in my head its so plastic- I wonder if anyone a long time a go ever thought that sex would be reduced to a computer graphic. its an ironic opposite maybe people are slowly changing- they are- to be more electronically oriented- I wont be one of them though I will stand alone. Mr. purdy too, he always talked about how overindustrialized the world has become and how it will eventually change back like in a cycle to the way it used to be- primitive. but I think his optimism is held up by a false sense of security most likely brought about by his memories as a child of a life with out computers . me on the other hand, they've surrounded me since birth so I cant see his 'cycle' but still I think its more morally correct to not get so swept up in industry - it only aids to the separate ness that everyone in our generation feels the nowhereness, and island like mentality- dad told me when I was little that every one is like an iceberg floating in a vast ocean and from the air you only see these little pieces floating so far away from each other, but beneath the surface, in our subconsciousness, we are all made up of the same water that connects us that we are surrounded by. so we aren’t really all alone were all created from the same stuff. I probably sound like a televangelist but I shouldn’t care what you think of me anyway. I wish I could just cuddle up with PROPNAME under heavy covers-warmth- and just feel his arm and shoulder under my neck and feel the ebb and flow of his breath on my forehead and slip away to sleep I love waking up next to him so warm - it doesn’t even matter if we get married - I've thought about it sometimes. its what's now that’s important and I love him and we’re happy if we ever do get married in a million years it will be because that will make us happy then ,whenever then becomes now. 
__label__label1 I am reading a book called Atlas Shrugged and it is affecting my consciousness and belief system more significantly than any novel I've ever read. Ayn PROPNAME wrote it and it's just a metaphorical portrayal of her philosophy of Objectivism, but the book touches on subjects that I feel are very important to all humans. I find myself newly enraged at those incompetent people of the world. Not because they are incompetent but because they are the ones who ask for help and breaks and favors by those people who built the society in which we live. The anti monopoly law is a perfect example of this. Why should the men who built the country be penalized just to give the other people who weren't strong, smart, or productive enough a "fair" chance. It really is disgusting. Just as is, in the theatre department they don't allow one person to get too many leads in order to give other people a chance. THIS IS STUPID. If those others who would never otherwise get a chance can't cut it, then they don't deserve a chance to begin with do they?  I also notice the moral depravity of some of my friends. These are the ones who are joining fraternities in order to get breaks when they go into the real world. Personally I would hate knowing that I found my station in life by the grace of one of my old drinking buddies. I would much rather know that my hard work, intelligence and talent got me to where I was. But not many people think like this anymore. I guess that I just have way too much faith in my abilities, but I'm glad I do. Ayn Rand is right in saying that incompetency should not be rewarded in society, but it is. So in the book, all of these genius men, who have built of the industrial world are becoming much too regulated, to the point of ridicule, so one guy called PROPNAME PROPNAME decides that all of the producers should go on strike against the looters. He decides to stop the motor of the world - hence, Atlas Shrugged. So one by one, men who own oil companies and car, and coal, etc. starts disappearing and the world fall apart. It is such a great argument too. You should never take advantage of the hand that feeds you, especially if you haven't the abilities to perform their task as well as they have. This is not, however, indicative of a condoning of ruthless, unfair capitalism. The men who build the world in this book form a secret Utopia and their motto is that they will never give to any man anything, nor will they take more than is their due. Thus, charging unfair prices etc. is just as bad as giving breaks to the dumbasses. Anyway, I have this friend called PROPNAME and since this is for psychology, hopefully someone will read this and can tell me what his problem is. Actually he's not my friend anymore because I don't want such an asshole for a friend. He's the only person I've ever met in my life that truly believes that he's better than everyone around him. You hear of people speaking of someone like this but they are never quite as serious about it as I am. He thinks that he's found the only way to living, and it's so wrong it's sad. The only thing by which he measures success is economic gain. I have heard say horrible things about all of his "friends" and have heard what he's said about me behind my back. I've overheard him saying that he's set  in life because when his dad dies he's going to get 000000. This wouldn't be so bad if his parents abused him or something but they are the nicest people in the world and give him everything he wants. Of course, this is probably the root of his problem. I've noticed that he doesn't go to parties unless he's throwing them. If he actually does go to one, afterward he makes it a point to call out all of the things that in his eyes were bad about it. He doesn't want to hang out with these people because they are irresponsible and are potheads, while he smokes just a much pot as they do. And, they pay rent and go to school all on their on while he does nothing but loot off of his parents. He really has sever problems. I guess you'd just have to know him to know exactly what I mean, the biggest asshole ever. Anyway, uhmmmmmm, I went back home this weekend to get my car and I got to see my dog. I missed her more than I missed my parents. She’s so pretty. She's a golden lab retriever and she sleeps in my bed with me every night, Just as she has since she was a puppy. the other day my mom almost got her run over by letting her go to the bathroom without the leash, she ran out in front of a car and they had to swerve up into our yard to miss her. Pretty scary. but she was ok thank god, just really scared. She had her tail between her legs all night long. My roommate is really cool and nice thank god. you never know what kind of freak you're going to get when you go pot luck, thank goodness he's not a freak. He's listens to a different kind of music than I do, but that's cool, because I'm learning a new genre. anyway, my 00 minutes are up so bye bye. 
__label__label1 I wanted to write about something traumatic that happened to me because, apparently, traumatic experiences and how to deal with ORGNAMEm is a pretty big fandango in this class. Something just happened, though, so I want to write about that and see where it takes me in the next nineteen minutes or so. The computer assistant in the theatre department (where I am right now, being a theatre major and all) just complimented me on my hat, a black fedora I bought in LOCNAME LOCNAME about a year and a half ago. I was visiting for about a week over spring break and auditioning for the elusive Experimental Theatre wing ORGNAME ORGNAME's ORGNAME ORGNAME of the ORGNAME. After a fairly successful audition I concentrated all of my efforts of exploring, something I had done about seven or eight months earlier the first time I visited. This time I was alone, though. The time before I had my brother, eighteen months my junior and my closest friend, at my side and all was well. This time I had to w0ait a couple of days for his arrival, since he couldn't get off school and I could, being a senior and having a few excused absence "college days" on my hands. So I set out to explore and found a bar in the mob district of LOCNAME LOCNAME that didn't ID and I found myself drunkenly wandering the streets of LOCNAME LOCNAME, stumbling upon Strawberry Fields in a haze and not realizing the significance until about a week later. After three days of being lost in my drugged little haze my brother joined me. When I picked him up at the airport I noticed that I had taken to thinking of myself as a LOCNAME LOCNAMEer. I had adopted the city and there was a definite change in the way my brother and I related to each other. This changed over the next four days, though, as he assimilated into New York the way I had and we set out to LOCNAME LOCNAME to begin our evenings with a little pasta, a Nat King Cole impersonator, a jug of white wine every night, and a restaurant owned by the mob.  After taking in as much of the culture and the underbelly of the city we found ourselves down to our last (having just dropped twenty bucks on some Thai food that smelled like sewer filth). It was our second to last day in the city and we decided to thrift store shop and try to extend our dollars as far as they would go. Then we saw them. In a small shop in the Village (not that there aren't a billion of them) we both saw fedoras that just said "you". We ended up dropping our last fifty dollars on our new hats and had to pay for our ride to the airport ( a limo, surprisingly cheaper than a taxi because it had a set fare) with a handful of quarters. We hadn't eaten for two days and there wasn't a meal of any kind on the plane (not even peanuts) so we wound up in LOCNAME on a two hour layover with nothing to do, empty stomachs, and no money. I ended up begging, trying to sell a stack of demo tapes I had cut for two bucks a pop. I ended up selling two, and we ate the best ORGNAME ORGNAME that has ever been eaten by a human. I remember that the only people who bought the tapes were other musicians. Maybe it's a karma thing ("Wow, that guy looks pathetic. Better buy his tape because that could be me someday. ")  One way or the other they understood. I was upset just because my plan was to randomly hand out this stack of tapes to people as they departed for different corners of the country, hoping that they would like it and that underground distribution would abound. Maybe it worked: I still don't know. I know it was passed around quite a bit in south LOCNAME, but not much further than that. Oh, well. By the by, I'm really tired right now because my band played a two hour show last night. We haven't played that long in about a year, since clubs usually limit you to an hour or less. We used to go two hours without even trying when we were playing for our friend's parties, but now we've gotten lazy. Last night really woke us up. I was so drenched in sweat that I actually had to wring out my shirt after the show. We didn't even get a decent crowd until the last thirty minutes or so. That's ok. Better things will come along soon enough. We play every Thursday at ORGNAME ORGNAME, which has no cover and is all ages. For some reason, this alone does not attract a crowd. It's really upsetting. I know we're not a bad band, so it's really frustrating when you can't talk people out of disco dancing at PROPNAME PROPNAME to enjoy a free show that accepts all ages and doesn't involve a DJ. Someday. About that traumatic experience. About five months ago I was hit by a car while I was crossing the street into PROPNAME's off LOCNAME. It was late and I was wearing all black and the guy didn't see me. I was looking the other way because I saw the car that hit me but he seemed too far away to reach me. I was more concerned about cars coming from the other direction, which is a curving road that is hard to see down. When he hit me his fender shattered my leg and I was thrown onto his windshield. He didn't brake until then and the force of him braking as I hit the windshield sent me flying into the road about twenty feet out. I never lost consciousness and never really felt all that dazed or affected by it. I just calmly looked up, announced that my "fucking leg was broken" and asked one of my friends to call 000. Then I just lay down in the road waiting for the ambulance. It started to rain. That night I was taken to LOCNAME and left alone for about an hour at a time in the ER. Only one of my friends cam to visit me. She held my hand while they pieced my leg back together and set it into a cast. They had already pumped me with morphine and I heard them mumble about amputation a time or two, but eventually they settled on inserting a rod from my knee to my ankle. The morphine did nothing to me, though, because they gave it in light doses and after years of recreational drug use I wasn't really affected. That and the pain was coming from the one part of my body where intravenous drugs couldn't possibly go. I ended up just biting down on a folded-up blanket, not wanted my screams to disturb others in the ER. Over the next three days I was observed and recovered quicker than anyone imagined. My family came to be with me from LOCNAME LOCNAME, except for my dad who was in LOCNAME on business. He wanted to rush to LOCNAME to be with me but I didn't want him to see me tied up to machines and weak. I knew he couldn't handle it. After about a half hour of coaxing he stayed in LOCNAME. He hasn't had a drop of alcohol in twenty years after getting a kidney removed before I was born. That night he drank himself into submission. Slowly my friends from the theatre department began creeping in until I had a steady stream of visitors and a room full of flowers, candy, and porn (don't ask). The faculty came to make sure that I was alright, something I never would've expected, and one night my nurse ( a PROPNAME PROPNAME sort of woman) turned my bed so that I could see the tower lit up in orange. I've never had school spirit or pride in any organization whatsoever, but for some reason I cried. For some reason I loved the sight of the tower at that moment. I've recovered completely. I was angry for a while and spent a lot of time screaming and damning anyone who could walk while I made my way around in a wheelchair. I marveled at the fact that, even when I was on crutches, nice families at the Arboretum would still pull their children closer and hold their purses tighter. I began to keep a journal, but by the time I had written five entries my anger was gone. My depression was gone. I couldn't even dwell of death, which I know I had cheated. I was just glad to be alive and to put it all behind me. Now I'm physically and emotionally recovered. I don't have nightmares and I don't fear cars. I don't know why. Maybe I'll learn that this semester. For some reason I recovered very nicely in all aspects from this whole awful little episode.  The good thing is that I'm happy and sober now. I had attempted suicide twice this past year, once just two weeks before the accident. Then I was put in a situation where I didn't try and death actually came for me, and I fought to stay alive. That's always struck me as odd. Oh well. For whatever reason I am a happier, if quieter person. Things are good. I'm looking forward to psychological experiments this year. Now I'm off. I've written for about thirty minutes and I think it's time for a cigarette. Bye bye now.   
__label__label0 Here I go. I keep thinking whether or not I am doing this right. I can't seem to spell anything right. I am going to correct all my spelling after I am done. This line just keeps on going. There was just a commercial with people that that said "I am in the woods" and it sounded like the other add that says "I am Tiger Woods". I am so glad the ORGNAME won today. I am not even looking at the screen now, because I was losing my concentration. Only 0 minutes have gone by. I wonder when my roommate will get back. I still don’t know why my phone won't work. This line just keeps on going. It is a little bit hot in here. I am getting tired. I sure am glad I got this chair. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing. I wonder bow many of my friends are in LOCNAME now. I had a dream about PROPNAME again last night. I wonder when I will see her next. I sure wish I could type better. Now it has been 00 minutes. When is PROPNAME going to call. It is 00:00. Time sure does go by faster here. I need to think about all the  things I need to do tomorrow. But I don’t want to. It has almost been 00 minutes. I am anxious to mail my letters. I wonder if I have any mail. I just found food on my shirt. I wish I had something better to eat. I wonder  Oh there showing the tennis highlights now. I am glad that PROPNAME is doing better. I am noticing that I am writing "I wonder" a lot. It is starting to get harder to type now because I am getting tired. I think the twenty minutes are up. I am stopping now. 
__label__label0 I hope I am doing this write!  I never really used the internet before and it took me forever to try and figure out how to log on. I feel better now that I am actually doing this, I thought I wouldn't figure it out in time then I would get a zero and bring my grade down. I am a freshman and I really want to do good. I hope my roommate isn't wandering where I am. We were supposed to do laundry after my class which was your class and ended at0. I was glad it wasn't raining when I got out because I didn't bring my umbrella. I am kind of upset that I couldn't find a smaller one than the huge one I brought. I don't want to look like a dork. I miss my boyfriend he is in LOCNAME LOCNAME where I am from. I wish he would've gotten in to UT like me. It would have been so much fun being here with him without parents always watching over us. My time on this machine expires in ten minutes and it doesn't seem like enough time but it was almost twenty minutes that I have been typing maybe a few minutes less but it took me a while to figure out how to get here anyway. I not a very fast typer so I hope I have written enough and about the write topic that is whatever I am thinking. Well thank god I am almost done I only have one more minute so I have to push the submit button before it cuts me  off. Bye. 
__label__label0 I am at my friends house right now because I don't have a computer to use at my home. I just decided to get this assignment over with. This room is really hot. There are four people in this house right now. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and me. My girlfriend, PROPNAME is asking everyone of us to quiz her on her vocabulary that she has to memorize by Friday. It is very noisy in here and PROPNAME is telling me to shut up. I really want to get drunk and have fun but I can't because I have school tomorrow. I need to stay focused on my school work and keep myself in control. I'm only a Freshmen and I'm really worried about UT because of the horror stories all my upperclassmen friends told me about. My father told me to concentrate on my studies because it is my responsibility to do excellent in school. He said that it is my life that I'm preparing for, not his. I'm also using my money because I'm using the loan that I received. I've been dating my girlfriend for two and half months and I think we're doing good. Everything is working just right. I cant wait till this weekend so I don’t have to worry about school for about two days. Actually, I have to do some reading and a short homework. I wonder if anyone sent me a E-mail. I better check it when my twenty minutes is up. I cant believe how much money I spent ever since I came to Austin. I spent so much on food, clothes, gas, and more food. Oh yeah, and mostly important, the books!  (Yeah right!) Oh man! I did so bad in Philosophy today. I read my homework but still got a zero because the quiz was a little tricky. This is kind of fun expressing my thoughts on the computer. Oh!  Twenty minutes are up!  Bye Bye!                                                                                  
__label__label0 Okay. I'm in the stupid SMURF lab. there are so many people here. I saw PROPNAME downstairs. Sometimes he worries me. He met a new guy the other day and already had sex with this guy. I don't know if he used protection or not. but it worries me. He's so. so. spontaneous about things. I don't ever really know if he thinks things through. He just does as he pleases which isn't a bad thing. but it can be dangerous. I wish he'd just look at himself and what he's doing and decide if it's the right or wrong thing to do. He doesn't need to be going around having sex with whomever whenever. He knows and I know that he's a whore. It's not a surprise to anyone. But, he doesn't care. so it seems. Of course, I call him a whore jokingly but in a way I'm serious about it. He knows what can happen to him and it sucks that he doesn't care. Man. Men!!! Men suck! PROPNAME needs to realize that I will never be with him again. He thinks things will change. he's so wrong. For two years I had to put up with his shit and all his lies. There is no way in hell I'd ever even give a second thought to going back out with him. He knows he's an asshole and I let him know that a long time ago. How dare he even bring up the idea of us getting back together. He's a 00 year old trapped in a 00 year old's body. He has no idea what a good relationship is and he doesn't know the meaning of trust. He needs to grow up and realize that he can't always get what he wants. and when he can't get it he needs to just give up and move on with his pointless life. I've moved on and he needs to realize that. I'm not there to be at his beck and call and I'm not there to just be there when no one else is. He lost whatever respect I had for him a long long long time ago. Why is it that I always seem to get stuck in the worst situations when it comes to relationships? Hell. let's see my record thusfar: hmmm, PROPNAME is the asshole, PROPNAME was just a jerk, PROPNAME is the only man I ever loved and he's in LOCNAME, PROPNAME was someone that I could consider a "summer love". but he's at another college. Well, screw it!!  I need to concentrate on getting all A's and B's this year so I can get that free plane ticket to anywhere in the LOCNAME. Plus, I get $00/A!!  I need the money. I'm poor now and I have bills to pay!  Damnit all to hell. bills!!!  Responsibility!!  Yeah, I have responsibilities as an adult but I don't think the 'rents realize that. I'm 00 years old. 00 in April. yet I'm still a little girl who can't do anything right for shit according to them. What the hell do they know?  I'm not living with them now and they don't see how hard I work to get where I am and how hard I try to be social, to get the education I need, and to get a job worth having in this freakin' town!!  It's hard to find a job. but I've done it. And what do they say when I tell them this?  "that's nice". What is that? Why don't they just tell me how they really feel. "Oh, well, that's still not the real world so it doesn't count"  I swear they piss me off. My mom is the worst. She wants to lecture me about dishonesty and all that shit. Well, HELLO! Guess who's fixin' to eat her words!! I caught her smoking this past weekend. Yep. right there by the side of the house puffin' away like a chimney. What was that you said mom?  You quit smoking?  Right. and I was so proud of you!  All that's blown to hell now. So, I caught her. and what did PROPNAME "PROPNAME, I can't trust you" do?  Well, she decides to kiss my ass to try and make up for her lie. Yes sir! She bribed me with four 00-minute phone cards and $00. OH and she even told me that I could just pay for my speeding ticket without having to take the class. . Yes, that means it would go on my record but "oh, that's okay. it's not much more on your insurance. Besides, we just got a load of money back from the insurance company because of our good  driving records". Oh yeah. she was brown-nosing BIG TIME. I have lost a lot of respect for her for doing that. I don't know whether I should just forget about it and let her do what she will or tell my dad and have him deal with it. I swear. this world is nothing but a big mass of contradictions! I'm not saying that I'm perfect. but I've learned over the past few years about what I want out of life and what I don't want. I'm living my life the way I want to. as stress-free as possible and as happy as possible. When I'm put into these stupid situations it just makes life that much harder and it sucks!  I'm so tired of looking at this computer screen. I think it's about time for me to stop thinking. Yep. it is about that time. Thank God. Now I have to go help PROPNAME with his Spanish work that he swore was gonna be "SOOOO EASY". I knew he'd have trouble. and I knew he would turn to me. I'm no bilingual. but what the hell. I do what I can to help my friends out. I've been called "too nice"? How the  hell can someone bee "too nice"????????? 
__label__label1    I really like doing this assignment. I did it in my senior AP English class many times. I think the assignment was really interesting to my teacher, and that is why we did it so often. I am having a little trouble with this one though because there isn't  rally a topic. My English teacher would usually give us a vague topic, just something to get us started. Some of the topics were going to college or music or sports or something like that. My favorite topic was always music. I think music may be the most important thing to me other than loved ones. I listen to it a lot and it makes me very happy. It is very important to me. But I think what makes me the most happy is playing the guitar. I love creating music. I think it is very gratifying. I may not always play real well, but I am always making some sort of music, even if it sounds terrible. The guitar is probably a kind of escape for me. I really forget about everything else when I am playing. It makes me feel so good. But I think I can do some of m best thinking when I have the guitar in my hand. I f I am just sitting there strumming the guitar it kind of clears my head. So I guess the guitar serves many different purposes for me. Lets see. I am trying my hardest not to write about college. It is very hard since it has pretty much consumed my life for the last two or three months. It is mostly because ever since I started getting ready to move there has been so much stuff to do. I am really being distracted by the television that is on in my room. I have terrible study habits that I need to break as soon as possible before I get to far into college. I was able to breeze through high school without studying, but I know I won't be able to do that in college. Of course sport center is on so it is very hard for my to resist. I know that I watch too much sports. I will really watch anything. 
__label__label0 I just always feel like I am better off when I get things done. I have found that I have been procrastinating a lot lately and I just want to get things back into order so I can do more fun things. I was happy about passing by the LOCNAME tennis club booth on my way back from class, I am hoping to have time to do that. I really wish I talked to the UT tennis coach abt playing on the team but ihope the players in this club are competetive and have fun personalities at the same time. not only do I like tennis, but I am happy bec it will give me a workout. I don't have much time to go to the gym  now and I really want to work out more often. I picked up an aerobics schedule today so maybe I will have time for some classes. but all of this reading and studying I have to do takes up more time than expected, I just feel like I don't have enough hours in my day to accomplish all of my goals. tonight I had a sorority meeting to go to which was so boring and I just wanted to leave so I could do more imprt things with my time. but I know in the long run this sorority thing will pay off bec I will get to meet a lot of people and it is an easier way to make friends whenyou already have this sort of group formed and you just have to actually meet the people already selected. ok, that was a really long and complicated sentence. another worry that is on my mind is regarding that experimental thing we have the option of doing. when I went to sign up today, all of the experiments were full so now I am worried I wont get a spot in a study and I will have to do the research paper. not that that is terrible, but iw ould just prefer not writing the paper, especially since I already took my time to fill out the pre testing form last night. whatever. I will have to just get used to everything and all the new changes, since I am a freshman and everything. when that happens, then I will be better able to organize my time and not stress so much. speaking of stress, I should have signed up for that reducing stress freshman seminar, it would have been really helpful abt now. actually, all the seminars were full by the time I got to register, since I was at the last orientation session - terrible mistake. I should have come to an earlier one but I didn't decide to come to school here until it was too late to get into the earlier sessions. so I had to go to the later one, oh well. at least I got classes that are required, I can't get everything I suppose. going to the university of florida was my other option but everyone I know, from  my high school and every other part of florida, goes there and I kind of wanted to get away from everything. even though I do miss pewople a lot, I think I am better of here. and, the good business school was a main consideration. since I was accepted, I felt like it was a good opportunity and I shouldn't give it up. everyone always asks me why I came all the way from LOCNAME, florida to texas and I always say bec of th ebusiness school. and that's true and all but ir eally like other thinga abrt it too. I was just admiring today the fountains - I love the nvironment. except for the people hanging around on guadeloupe that I have to pass by on my way back to the castilian everyday - where I live. those people scare me, and I know I have nothing to be scared of I just don't like seeing them there. anyway, I am looking at a picture of me and my mother now and thinking about how my parents are leaving on a trip to europe tomorrow morning - that will be fun. I hope they have a great trip an safe. I am always worried abt them, I just don't want anything to happen to them. I know my mom is scared of flying and I just hope everything is ok for them. they have wanted to go to france and england for a long time. actuakly, they wanted to got o italy too - they were all jealous that I got ot go there with my friends a couple of spring breaks ago. whenever I think abt that trip I think abt how I wrote abt it - the uffizi museum to be more specific - in my application to the university of virginia. even knowing that you souldnt write abt trips I still did it, I guess I thought they wouldnt care if I did it. that's funny. I guess I am still bitter I didn't get into there, it was my top choice of schools. but I am happy at UT. I hope it doesn't get as cold as it sometimes does. anything below 00 is terrible for me, coming from miami and all where the temperature stays on an average of 00 - I love it. speaking of which, playing tennis all the time int hat heat was not too much fun, but it was loads of fun. I miss my tennis coach, she sent me a present here but I havent gotten it yet, I should call her. but I havent talked to her inso long I think it would be weird to call her, oh well. maybe I will one day, I guess I should to say thank you when the present comes. or I could send  a card, whatever. I will decide later, if it ever gets here!! well, 00  minutes is up and I would like to write more but, like I said before, so much to do and so little time. I still ahve to read a million and two pages and I only have 0 classes tomorrow. I just want to get te next days reading out of the way so idont have to thinka bt craming it all in tomorrow night. this was fun! 
__label__label1 I miss my best friend. My other friend could care less of my existence since he has a woman now. I am so unorganized, and I can't type for shit. I am definately frustrated and scared. I am scared that my classes are going to be extremely hard, but most of all, I wish that I did not have to decide on my future. I have no clue what I want to do with the rest of my life, and that is a really big decision. I wish I could just travel the world and never look back. I really wouldn't mind being a bum, as long as I was in paris. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing right now. I have so much to read and do, but I just never find the time. THe time is just sitting there waiting on me, but I have yet to find my way. Organization is a good thing to have. Something I do not aquire. Figures. I want to meet some really cool friends, but for some reason, I don't think they are here. Maybe I should have moved to LOCNAME. Now I will prolly never go. Figures again. I paused to think of what to say, and a really bad word came to mind. Again. I don't know what to do. I'm a dork magnet. I have  zits all over my face, and the cute guy next door has yet to be seen. Figures. Ambulences. I hate that sound. I find it very annoying in the middle of the night. Gas. Roommate - uncertain. I was hoing for some drop - dead woman, and get a sad little home-schooler. Oh well she says. Well, it looks like my time is up. . C-you. 
__label__label0 Sometimes, I don't understand my ex-Boyfriend. He tends not to tell me everything, especially the ones that he thinks I shouldn't have to worry about. Maybe it's because we didn't have enough time to know more about each other before I left. A lot of times, I sincerely wished I had known him earlier, and things between us could have been lot better. When we were together, I didn't think I would miss him that much even if I came back to LOCNAME. But, somehow, he knew I would miss him. But I really didn't realize how much I miss him until now that I am back here. I couldn't call him nor email him. The only thing I can do to keep in touch with him was write letters. It takes about a month back and forth. And one month is really too long for me. I want to know how he is doing and if he misses me as well. I wish he could come here to see me. But I know it's just my imagination to something that's almost impossible. Even though we never really talk about how we are now since we are so far away from each other, at least, I know that we are still good friends. 
__label__label0 guess ill just have to wait. atleast I can get this out of the way then. I'm so tired, but I think its that coffee from mojo's thats keeping me up. I have that song stuck in my head by aliyah. "I got what you want, I got what you need, can I get another shot, this time I going to make it hot", oh well, enough of that. I finally get to see salima again!!!! this friday!!!!! I can't wait after forever, I'm so excited. anyways, my hands are getting tired from typing this much, and its only been 0 mins. I'm going to go crazy, no way I can write like this for 00 mins. oh no, this sucks. oh well, nothing I can do, I have to stay awake for my laundry anyways. atleast my roommate eric stopped snoring now. and finally that damn pretesting crap worked. I finally got the confirmation sheet, now I'm set to go do some experimenting. hope nothing messes up though, I don't want to end up like the nutty professor or like in flubber or anything. its probably going to be easy, like analyzing dreams and crap like that. oh well. guess I shouldnt call it crap, I mean this is psychology class, I can't make fun of it in a psychology paper. that doesn't even make sense, I'm goin crazy, because my hands are HURTING!!!!! oh man, my eyes are closing, I'm fading fast, got to fight it, can't sleep, I can do it, then all I have to do is sleep in class tomorrow. oh, but I can't, I have . my ear itches. just scratched it. anyways, as I was saying. I have a damn quiz tomorrow, and the TA hasnt taught us anything. she's so sorry, I know more than her. but its those word problems that are messing me up. I can do the work just fine, just those word problems sound too complicated, and I get confused on what its asking me to do. oh well, hopefully there wont be any word problems to do. man this sucks. I'm bored, gloria is sleeping, so I can't chill in her room tonight and "study". salima is asleep, so I can't talk to her. kajal is being a bitch, so I don't want to talk to her even if she is awake. amar and ripal are both asleep, steve is probably awake, but he talks too much, so I don't want to chill with him. hopefully when I get off the computer gloria will have left me a voicemail telling me to come upstairs and chill with her. maybe she is awake, because I just called her and talked a little while ago. she said she was going to sleep, but oh well. she likes some other guy now, but thats ok, I already got what I wanted from her. but she's cool, we'll have other "study" sessions, I'm sure of it. she was pretty good though. oh well, can't get into that now, just in case somebody that shouldnt be reading this does. damn, not even 00 mins yet. I've never wrote this much so fast ever. its kind of cool, but weird at the same time. because none of it makes any sense and none of it flows, thats ok though, I guess thats the point of the assignment. now I'm wondering about what experiments I will be able to do. seems like fun. I can't wait. I'm excited because my check card came in the mail today. now tomorrow I have to go to the co-op and buy the solutions manual for calculus, because the TA doesn't know how to teach, and she's a aloser. I hope I'm typing everything fine. I'm trying to type with my eyes closed. lets open my eyes now and see how things went. hey, pretty good!!!  anyways, I hope fauzia brings me that paper in class tomorrow about selling your notes and all, it'll help out, I mean, every little bit counts!!! well I'm almost done know. its been 00 mins. so not too much to go. this kind of sucks, meghan and angela are coming on friday, in the evening, and I'm leaving for back to dallas in the afternoon. hopefully I can stop by baylor on the way back from dallas and check out the dorm room. we'll see what happens. man, now that I'm thinking about angela, gloria did the same stuff to me that she did, but gloria went farther. oh well, she looks a lot better than angela anyways, so I guess its better that way. ok, enough of that. I'm just really hoping we can do that kind of stuff later on also. ok, enough, for reals this time. man, my contacts are sticking, and they're causing my eyes to shut. oh well, hopefully when I'm done with this, the clothes will be done. that way I can get em out, and go to sleep, I havent had good sleep since I moved here. I got to wake up all early. and besides that I'm always awake, never sleeping. but I guess missing sleep last night was worth it, after what happened. hehehehehe. oh well, ill miss sleep for that any night of the week. I don't care about sleep when that is concerned. I was all sore last night from working out too, but I'm not going to let that stop me. hellz nooooo!!!!!  I'm still a bit sore, because we started working out on saturday. its starting to wear off, so I'm getting used to working out, I just hope we stick to working out everyday, because I need it. but I kind of like that sore feeling, because atleast then you know you're doing something, and that something is improving. man, this is loooonnnnnggg, but its ok, I doubt anybody will even read it. I guess its just like a completion grade. man its hard to have your words and all agree with me. don't just play with me like that. well actually, you can play with me anyway you want. oh good, only 0 more minutes than I get get ready to hit the sack. 0 minute!!!! this is weird its like a countdown for newyears, but hena didnt make a big deal about leaving. I wish salima understood more and didnt cry as much as. whoa, just opened my eyes REAL wide, now I can see, and I see that it has been over 00 mins, so I am done. bye bye 
__label__label0 Why must it be so hard?   Why must I live like this?  Would it not be better if I simply throw away my life?  It would be so much easier. I wouldn't have to worry all the time about people's criticism. I wouldn't have to worry about making mistakes. But then, I'm human am I not?  Aren't we social creatures?  If I seperate myself from others, would I not cause myself harm?  Would I not also cause others pain?  A life lost is a gift lost. It is so difficult for me to live like this. Always in pain. But sometimes I gain a sense of glory when I live through the sufferings. It's as though these sufferings are meant to makme stronger. Like steel being tempered in a hot flame. Yet, there's still more pain to come. Will I survive?  surely there will be a point when I will not get stronger and break. But then how will I know where my limit is?  whether I live a mediocre life or on to te fullest, I will die. However, it seems as though the latr fashion of life is better. Therefore, with spirit, I will strive to live out that lifestyle. I try each moring, to fight the tempatations and do what is expected of me. If I live this way and think that it is the best way. Should I not persuade others to do the same?  Why not?  It seems that if everyone lived their life more fully, mankind will be more efficient and fruitful. We will  prosperous as  whole. But if I were to tell this opinion to others, someone will tell me that I should respect their opinion that they can do what ever they wish. But if it is right to repect all the opinions of all people. Would there not still be a conflict which contradicts that opinion that says that we all must respect the opinion of all?  For example, what if someone else's opinion is that people should not accept all opinions as truth. Would not the opinion of the person saying that we should respect all opinion be contrary to that opinion?  This brings about a lot of contradictions. Hence, notall opinions are to be respected.           
__label__label0 At the dorm where I live there is a girl that is Anorexic, and we all call her PROPNAME for short. This s probably the rudest thing that you could ever possibly do to a person in this state, but then she doesn't know that we call her this. I am also confused about guys, and why they react the way they do. My friend told me the weirdest story about her weekend today. She said that she was dancing in a club and this really big guy started pissing on her leg, and then her boyfriend hit the guy right in the sweet spot, and the bouncers kicked her boyfriend out instead of the pisser. That is so not fair and disgusting!  I can not believe that someone would actually do that in the middle of a crowd of people. Anyway I really do not know what to talk about because I am really tired. I slept today for about two hours, and now I am more tired than I was before. I ate lunch at LOCNAME today and I had Alligator for the first time. It was really good and it kind of tasted like chicken. Well I just talked to my boyfriend on the phone and he told me that one of the guys he used to work with died today in a high speed car accident. The funeral is on Tuesday, and he wants me to go with him because he can not cope with it by himself. I have a problem with dead people and funerals, and I swore that after my grandpa died, I would never go to another funeral. Well I really want to see a movie pretty soon, because I haven't seen one in a long time. I really need to see the Horse Whisperer, because I heard that it was a really good movie! 
__label__label0 What time is it. I need to be at the house at ten. My mouth feels like the sensation you get right before you throw up. They say that Gatorade is a thirst quencher but why does it make your mouth so dry. It is so quiet right now. As I stare at my roommates applied calculus book I am lost in the colors. The bright colors formed in various shapes and sizes make a maze for my wandering eyes. I wonder what I have to write for the other assignment. God, I could really use a shower. It seems like I have been sweating all day. I wonder where my roommates are and what they are doing?   My roommates are slobs. I feel as if I am in a sea of clothes as I sit here on my roommates computer. I wonder if that picture of PROPNAME was ever really a picture that was taken by somebody or was it all just from computers. If it was a picture that was taken I wonder what that bull was thinking. he was probably thinking how ridiculous humans are. Actually, he was probably thinking where the best area in the pasture to eat grass is. I don't like this assignment very much. I feel like some druggy. Look at the colors man, and all the shapes. I don't know. It's kind of cool to put down on paper the th0ings you are thinking. 
__label__label0 first, it took me a long time to get through the Austin traffic. then, when I got home, and called jenny, she wasn't ready to come over. she came over anyway even though she hadn't shaved her legs. that was kind of bad. next, I still had to deal with the fact that she had messed around with PROPNAME, one of my supposedly good friends. all they did was kiss, but it still really hurt me. she had told me that it would never happen again after she and PROPNAME messed around, but she lied. I can't believe that she did that. then I told her about the fact that I had sex with heather back during the summer, so she wasn't really happy about that, but that's understandable. I still love her, but she has really putting me to the test this weekend. hen, later on Friday night, she told me that she had liked PROPNAME, so what happened wasn't as much of an accident as I had first thought it was. come to find out, she had gotten drunk at her apartment and then called PROPNAME to come over. that's when the kiss happened. that really hurts me. so she told me that, but she still wanted to have sex with me. I agreed, I don't know why, but I did. and then, in the middle of it, she started crying, that really hurt me. then after that, she told me that she didn't even want me to come with her to college station with her. that tore me apart. I didn't know how to handle it, so I freaked, I just started yelling at her. I don't know why, I should have been more calm , but I just couldn't do it. I tried to calm myself down, but nothing worked. I still can't believe how mean I was. and then, on Saturday morning, I called her, because I thought she was going to leave without calling me like she said she would. and then, she told me that she had changed her mind, and now she didn't want me to go again. then I freaked again. I started yelling at her. I was really hurt, like id never been hurt before. I couldn't believe that anybody could hurt me this bad, but she could do it. s I called PROPNAME, and got a ride with him to college station. it took me an hour and a half to eat my ORGNAME lunch. I had lost my appetite. I was miserable. PROPNAME could see that. I got to a&m, but I had no desire to party, all I wanted to do was talk to jenny so that I could apologize to her for what I said. I ate like half my dinner. it was good but I just didn't want to eat. so, we went to the party, and I was miserable, people were drinking and all I wanted to do was talk to jenny. finally, PROPNAME gave me the number to PROPNAME's cell phone. so I called it, and PROPNAME wouldn't let me talk to jenny. then PROPNAME answered and she wouldn't let me talk to her, and then PROPNAME, her brother wouldn't let me talk to her. I was really hurt. so I got her brothers number from PROPNAME. she had given it to him. that really hurt me, that she gave her  cell phone number to PROPNAME, and her brother's number to PROPNAME. that devastated me. I just wanted to cry. it just wasn't fair. then PROPNAME called her, and convinced her to come to the party. he handed me the phone, but she really wouldn't say anything to me. I was crushed again. the one thing that I loved more than anything in this life, including myself wouldn't even talk to me. I have never felt so bad. I wanted to crawl in a hole and die, but I couldn't do that, I had to stay semihappy for the party. it was all an act, I was not happy at all. finally, at 0000 she came over. she wouldn't even acknowledge me. her roommates hate me now, and they weren't afraid to let me know. fuck PROPNAME, I hate that bitch. I have never liked her. I just want to beat her fucking head in. she is a stupid dirty whore. I don't care if she hates me, I hate her. I feel bad that cristin hates me. I like her. I really regret saying anything bad about her. then breiane came out and tried to start a fight with jenny. she claimed to be my friend. fuck her. she s a bitch. she acts like a stupid tease. she a dumb tease, she never gives anybody anything. she just likes to pretend like she's a whore. I don't really like her anymore, but it still hurts me that she doesn't want to have a friendship with me. and then, on the way home I got a speeding ticket. oh after I talked to jenny, I got a half-as hug, and then she hugged PROPNAME and didn't want to let go. then she didn't even say good-bye to me. I was hurt again. back to the speeding ticket, it was for 00 in a 00. I'm going to be fucked if my dad finds out. she didn't call me on Sunday like she said she would. that really hurt. I wanted to call her so bad, but I couldn't, I wanted to so bad, not even funny. on Monday, I talked to her for two hours, it was great, we made out. I liked it so much. she didn't call me last night. she called me this morning at 0. it woke me up. I love her, but she hasn't called me tonight yet. I really want to talk to her, so I hope that she calls me tonight. I stayed up to 0 waiting for her last night, then I fell asleep. tonight, I wont make that same choice. I'm going to go to bed early tonight. 
__label__label0 I know there's nothing "wrong" I can write, but I still feel like whatever I'm writing may not be what they had in mind. It's about 00:00, and I am starving. As soon as I finish this I'll get to go and eat. I just came back from calculus, which is at least a 00 minute walk away from where I am (which is Dobie). I don't think I'm going to learn too much from the professor I have for calculus. He doesn't ever explain what the hell he's trying to do, and, like today when this guy tried to ask him, he almost yelled at him for jumping ahead. It is really frustrating because he first says something and then writes it down verbatim, and it makes me really mad. He wastes so much class time writing down the obvious even after he's said it ten times. I tried taking notes, but I doubt they'll help. I have always loved math, but this is just frustrating. My friend PROPNAME (who also lives here nad is from my tiny hometown) has a suitemate named PROPNAME, who had him last year. She said it's horrible. SLhe only knew two people who got an A in his class. She was telling me about how he writes down every little thing, and now I see what she means. She also said his tests are nothing like the homework, so I don't know what to expect. I am so hungry right now. I didn't eat too much this morning, because I never seeem to be hungry when I first wake up. My roommate is really sick. Ithink she has strep throat. Which means it'll only be a matter of daysbefore I get it too. My immune system has never been that good. I know, I know, I never really exercised that much, but I never seem tok have too much energy. My mom always thought I was anemic, but tests show I'm supposedly not. It's so weird how whenever I walk around campus I keep seeing people I know. Well, not really know, but I recognize them from camptexas or orientation or somewhere like that. I usually don't get to know too many people from placeslike that because I tend to be a little on the shy side. People always toldm e I'd outgrow that, but, well, I'm still waiting. In fact if there's onet hing I could change about me, ti'd probably be that. Everyone says you can make yourself  not be shy, but I'm sorry, I don't know how. I've tried and tried, but to no avail. When I'm around a lot of people I know, it's not too bad. Like in high school, I knew everyone in school (it's a small school and we've allb een together since kindergarten) and it was never too bad. I didn't love public speaking or anything where a lot of attention was directly on me, but I was always pretty comfortbale around everyone. But here I feel kind of lonely. My cousin, ORGNAME, who is a sophomore here, says it was that way for him lst year. I can't even reach one of my older friends here. I don't know what the problem is. And my other friend I called never called back. I don't know if she just didn't get the message, or if she's not calling back because she doesn't want to. My friend PROPNAME and I spend a lot of time together (we eat together and stuff) but she's already separating form me a little bit. At least we're going to the football game together. I'm looking forward to the game. I miss football. I never eallly appreciated it until I played powder puff last year. I somehow always feel like I'm overlooked because I'm quiet. At lest I hope it's because I'm quiet, and not just because I'm easy to overlook. I'm the youngest in my family, and whenever my older brother would be talking to my mom, she would always listen to him and ignore me, no matter what I was saying, until he left the room. Honestly, they thought because I am younger that whatever I say can't possible be as important as what he's saying. I could be telling her the house is one fire while he was telling her how he drove to town, and she wouldn't listen. Don't get me wrong, she has always been a great mom, but that has always bothered me, maybe more than it shoyuld. I don't really believe in those horoscope things, but sometimes when I have read them (at the end of theday) some eerie things ahave been true. Anyway, I read one of them on the ocmptuer. First of all, I have never been a "typical" sagittarius, like the magazines and articles say. They say they're all outgoing, and at times I am painfully shy nad introverted. Well, the one I read on the computer said the way to most hurt my feelings was to ignore me. And, that's true. If one of my friends is a total asshole to me, I will usual forgive them if they will just pay some attentin to me. I don't' think I have too many people in my life that I can count on, and that's really what I need most. I don't know if there's anyway I can fix that, but it's been a long 00 years. This probalby sounds like I'm a manic depressive, but before you call the authorities, let me assure you I'm not. I just don't have very high self esteem at times, and I often feel like I'm all alone in the world. I ahve a fear that I'll never find anyone to love me (like a husband). I don't see how someof  these other people manage to meet tons of guys, while I'm always alone. And most of those girls don't even appreciate them, and I know I would. Maybe it's back to the shyness thing. I really don't know, but I wish whoever did wuold tell me. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I was hoping my classes this smester would help, but I don't know. Part of me wants to go into business, but by the time I get accepted into the business school, I may change my mind again. I'm in the natural sciences thing as an undeclared pre-med right now, but who knows howl ong that will last?  I'm not lazy, but it takes me a hwile to get readjusted into going back to school. And even though I was in two ap classes my senior year and I graduated valedictorian by a long shot, I never had to work TOO hard in school. This stuff just came naturally to me. 
__label__label1 The class is very interesting. The psychology class I took in high school was rather boring. I planned to be a psychologist, perhaps clinical. After taking the class, I was turned off at the idea. This class has renewed my interest and has caused me to begin thinking again (finally). At this point, I just looked at my watch and realized I have only been typing for three minutes. I am not sure what else to say. The first idea that came into my head was my car. I own a 0000 dodge charger. It is a nice car and is also quite fast. It used to belong to my father, and he gave it to me. We got it out of storage in 0000. At that point, we began to restore it, a job that still isn't fully complete. My high school experience was a strange one. I spent my first three years in LOCNAME. For my senior year, I had to move to LOCNAME. While there, I realized that I matured mentally. I thought about the differences in society, and how people only a few hundred miles part can vary so much. I am glad to be in college now. The classes are not what I had expected them to be. To succeed, one must be very self motivated. I am finding it slightly difficult to get things done at times. Cafeteria food is another factor on my mind. First of all, most of the time I don't like the food. Next, when I am hungry, there isn't anything to eat. The cafeteria is closed for some reason. I don't know. Nothing more is coming to mind, other than the dull glow of my computer screen. My time has elapsed, so I will finish by saying that. I can't think of anything to finish with. 
__label__label1 at this point I am very unsure of what exactly to do or where my direction for the future is. My paranoia that I developed from living in ny has certainly overcome my life as everyday is almost a struggle at times to go on because I so easily find something to mess it up. I feel as if everything is always ready to go wrong, so I guess I need a more optimistic view of my life so I don't have to have negative beliefs everyday that ruin a perfect day.  I guess I am also questioning whether I belong in LOCNAME or if I should return to LOCNAME and transfer to nyu business school. I will need a 0. 0 both semesters which will be close to impossible for myself in order to stay here. in addition I also wonder if I belong here and if I can fit in with everyone else. they are all nice to me but I just wonder if I can fit in and if they are all being fake to me behind my back, not that I don't already have to deal with that in ny. if it were not for people I could trust like PROPNAME or PROPNAME or a very few others than I don't think I could make it here. I am very surprised to find how certain people have just drifted away and its like I make an effort and they don't even care about it. I just feel that sometimes things are not any better here than in ny and if it came down to the two I would probably just go back to NYC.   NYC has a very special importance to me. I feel in a weird way that I can fit in there and it is my real home. to have the opportunity to live there for college and party all the time is really exciting, although I wonder if it would be the right choice to go back east since I was so miserable there. PROPNAME is the only person who I can count on and maybe even PROPNAME if I was not so pissed at her for going out with mike, but then again maybe that is my fault. if I wasn't so flirty and actually expressed my feelings than maybe it could have worked a lot better, but then again I always find someway to screw things up as usual which always haunts me at every task or thing now because I go in with such a negative attitude all the time. hopefully I can have another positive year like last time and it will help me be more confident. In the mean time I really need to focus on new goals and establish myself more positively:       0. get a 0. 0 average so I have the opportunity to stay if I want to but keep all transfers in mind especially nyu or something in the LOCNAME area in case I feel the need to leave.    0. keep working out and getting big - competition is tough and I have to compete with you know who so I feel as if I must keep on going and hopefully it will work and I will look decent for once in my life - I also need to stay healthy and I need, I want a 0 pack by years end if it kills me      0. work on being social despite my physical problems and hopefully I will win out with whatever way it goes      0. help your community out and help others - remember you have been bad and need to fulfill certain things because the lord put me here for a reason and I want to be helpful and give happiness to others since I am not happy at least     Remember to keep it real and tight  . CAN'T NOBODY HOLD ME DOWN!!!!  I CAN'T STOP! I WON'T STOP! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO STOP!   ) 
__label__label0 I have a paper to start writing for English, and I'm dreading it because it will be very hard. It's about the short story "A Room of One's Own" by LOCNAME LOCNAME. In that story she also wrote in sream of conciousness so that is kind of weird. I really do not like the book at all. It's incredibly boring. It takes a feminist standpoint of women writers, and since I am not a feminist and only took that class because it was all that was open (I wonder why),I cannot relate to the anger Woolf seemed to have about there not being many women writers. Now, I am trying to figure out exactly what else to write about in this paper. It is really hard for me. I did the other assignment first because I found it much easier to do then this one. I don't completely understand exactly what I am supposed to be writing about, but we did stream of consciousness in my AP English class last year, and I think that it's all about writing exactly what the thoughts are that come into your head as they come into your head. My geography class is awful. the teacher is so boring. I've almost fallen asleep every time I go into that classroom. I decided to sit closer today to try and pay closer attention to what he's saying. I wonder if it's just a myth that the closer you sit the more you pay attention. Maybe that could be a psychologiacal survey we do- if one has not already been done on that. Now, I have again drawn a blank in what to say. it's so much easier to think when you don't have the pressure of having to write it down. I think my fried PROPNAME is mad at me. She goes to ORGNAME, and I had to write her an email about ORGNAME's unfortunate loss to ORGNAME yesterday. It's not like she hasn't made fun of LOCNAME. I feel like I'm back in Jr. high!  PROPNAME and I have been friends forever- actually only since 0th grade but it sure feels like forever. I miss my friends at home. I feel like we've gotten so distant from each other and it's only been a week since I left. I talked to my friend PROPNAME last night, and she was distant to me also. We just didn't have much to say, our lives are completely different from each others now. It's so weird how much people change from each other when you change their surroundings. I guess we were so much alike because we were constantly together. that could have a big effect on things, huh?  I wonder how long my friendships with people will last. The only one that seems to be maintaining right now is with someone that I wasn't even very close to this year- it's so odd to me how that happens. This twenty minutes sure is taking a long time to end!  I have to go put some money in the bank today. Actually I have a ton of errands to run today, but I need to finish my homework first. I still have a lot of pages to read in "A Room of One's Own" even though it was supposed to be read by today. Oops!  Then I have that awful paper to write over it. I mean who really cares about PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, and PROPNAME PROPNAME? I don't even know how to start writing it, I don't even completely know what I'm supposed to write about. Well, it's been twenty minutes and my thoughts are becoming jumbled so I'm going to stop writing now. 
__label__label0 I don't have enough time in my day for important schoolwork, studying, work, rest time, AND enough sleep to make me feel good. I haven't even left myself enough time on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays for lunch. What was I thinking making those work hours for myself. I gave myself 00 minutes to get to class. I have to wake up in the morning and work from 0 until whenever I get off to get to class in 00 minutes. that's no time to even stop and think or do an errand here and there. I had to go home this weekend to get a bunch of homework and studying done. I have one of the busiest weeks this week. Everything seems to be due on the same day, but thankfully not the same hour. When can I sleep?  I have to write four menus for four dinners of twenty people and write the ingredients list and have everything organized and typed. At least I can type and work here late at night. it is a getaway from my hot house and hot room. I should stay here all night one night. it's so cool and comfortable in here. I have to clean sometime today in between classes. the only reason I have time for anything now is because I didn't work today. I had to wake up with not enough sleep and I didn't even work today. I guess it's good though because I'm getting this and the pretesting done and that's important. I wonder if we get some sort of receipt for doing this like we are supposed to in the pretesting. I hope so it would be my luck that it doesn't get submitted. if someone is reading this, it was submitted. I wonder if anyone is actually reading this. it makes me so mad and frustrated with the mail system. it's always the really important letters and mail that gets lost. why did it have to be  that letter that got lost?  I have to go to some building to get my password for receiving email because I can't remember my password. I have to also pick up my financial aid check. maybe it's in the same building. I can't help correcting my errors as I type. it's a habit thing. my finger automatically goes to the delete key when I see an error. at least now I can what was I typing??? I think faster than I type and I type pretty fast, but as I type one thing I'm thinking of something else. it's weird to write down what you think. I don't usually think "oh I'm thinking about this" I just think. thought just go through my head. usually the thoughts that I really hear are the worried and stressed out thoughts because I know I'm slacking already and what is it like the 0rd week of school? has it been 00 minutes yet?  when you watch the time, it goes so slow. maybe that's what I should do to savor my time. just watch it. if I could watch a clock as I sleep it would be perfect. my sleep time would be good and long. well it's been twenty minutes. it makes me feel good that I got this done. that's one thing on my long list of things to do. What if they don't like my menu for the week?  it's too boring. the menu for this week has so my variety. oh I don't care. I have to stop thinking or I'll never stop writing. 
__label__label0 Since I am already on the computer I am going to do 0 writing assignment. That's good because I wont have to worry about it later. I can take care of other things on my list, and I 'll be that much closer to going home. I like my new place. Its big and cold and my best buds live there. Theyre all cool except for the new guy, jon. This fella really has a stick up his ass. I respect that he works full time and is usually tired, but come on. Working doesn't give you any special rights except to get a paychek. It sure doesn't mean that all of your roommates should feel sorry for you and get you things. I can tell this is going to be a problem. We've already had words several times. What blew my mind was that this guy was willing to let it escalate into a fistfight in less than a minute. I mean, he's got to live with me for a whole year!  Am I the only one thinking here?  I really had to get raw then, telling him that that is NOT how we handle things in a civilized society, especially mine. He wants to shack up with me, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME, then he has to realize that we're tight and that if anybody gets roughed up, its him. Also, PROPNAME's girlfriend has become a permanent fixture, already. I don't understand why she can't live where she pays rent, and carry on a relationship simultaneously. Everyone else does. I love bob to death, but this woman is no good for him. They're engaged, and she still gives everybody the "look" when he leaves the room. I feel sorry for him. But I should probably be glad it's not still me. I think the only reason that I bitch about some things is that it frustrates to see my bros not have it together like I do. Like half of my boys from dobie last year aren't even coming back. and the clincher, the real salt in the wound, is that none of them couldn't mentally make it here, its that they were so fucking lazy and unmotivated that they pissed it all away. Those were some of my best friends ever. I'll keep in touch with them, but when I talk to them I always feel a twinge of anger at them for not filling thier end of the bargain. They say they'll be back next semester, but I don't believe. A lot of them are so lazy that not even seeing what they'll miss is enough to get their attention. That's why I stay focused and that's why I'll stay at ut. 
__label__label1 I don't have to follow any rules except for the ones thORGNAME I create for myself. As the days have gone by I have slowly but surely felt that I am alone. Not being without my family has created feelings ORGNAME sadness inside. I know that all of this is just part of life and a certain period of adjustment that everyone in life must go through. I have done some crying and soul searching alone in my dorm room. I am expecting that my time in college will put me to the test and show me my weaknesses and strengths. I have been forced to come to terms with the fact that I am now the only one responsible for my well-being, time management, and academic matters. I must now assume total responsibility for myself. However I know that my family is always here for me as far as moral support is concerned and when I am in need of more money!  rrHaHa!  I am really feeling excited about being in LOCNAME because I am closer to my sister in LOCNAME LOCNAME and there is a wide variety of people here to interact with. I love to walk down the streets and see everyone, what they are wearing, how they are acting, and all around just what is going on. I consider myself to be someone who is open to people and their different lifestyles. LOCNAME, the town that I am from, has the population at LOCNAME and it is a rather conservative place. If some of the people in LOCNAME were to go down to LOCNAME and walk the streets, they would get stares and be talked about. I love the fact that in ORGNAME all things go. Going to class was somewhat of a nervous experience for me because I did not know what to expect. I found out that it was somewhat like the high school class experience, except for the fact that there were now hundreds of people in my classes. Also, I don't have to go to class if I don't want to. Although I could not see that as a possibility because I feel if I do that, then I will fall behind and lose valuable information. I feel really stressed because things have seemed to be going wrong for me since I got here. I have been misplacing things, tearing apart my room looking for them and then finding them right under my nose. I guess it is because I feel overwhelmed about being here at school. I just need to relax and enjoy this ride. I find it frustrating that parents and other relatives always give me the bad side of college, like, don't walk by yourself at night because you might get raped, don't spend too much money, don't do this and don't do that. Not that that is not valuable and understood but it's all negative. I like it when people are positive with me and say oh it's going to be great, you are going to have so much fun at college, you will learn so many things. My sister and her fiancé came to see me one day and my future brother-in-law made college seem like the best thing in the entire world. He is now a civil engineer and all he could say was that he wished he could come back to college because he enjoyed it so much. He really gave my roommate and me a better and more comfortable sense of being in college, instead of the Oh my gosh, I'm so scared of college and I know I'm going to end up killing myself view that is usually portray by others. Overall I am a mass of mixed emotions and look forward to anything and everything that I will experience here at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at Austin. 
__label__label0 At my high school I graduated with a class of 00, and most of my classes were comprised of 0 to 00 students. Sitting in an auditorium with over 000 other students is hard to get used to. I try to sit close up to the front of the class so I don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; I think it helps. All in all, I think  I am going to enjoy "college life". However, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. I don't think I have read so much of textbooks my whole life. Also, I find the e-mail thing a little confusing. I didn't have e-mail at my school, and I wasn't online at my home computer so I am not up to date on all the terminology. I know I shouldn't be, but I am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. I am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though I am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than I am. ( I hope! ) Lately, I find computers really frusterating. I am trying to get into the pretesting page for Psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. I have already completed part of the Pretesting survey, and I clicked done after each section so I hope it saved my work. Every day after my classes, I feel like I have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes I realize I get too stressed out over nothing. I'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. I have also learned that if I write things down I will remember to do them, and I won't get stressed out worrying if I have forgotten to do a certain assignment. Although I was a little worried after the first day of classes, I don't think college will be so bad as long as I keep up with my homework like I plan and don't procrastinate like I became so accustomed to in high school. I like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. This gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. I hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. Last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. My roommates and I had to drive to ORGNAME ORGNAME last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. And for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. I never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any. 
__label__label1 I'm planning a trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME, and I don't exactly have any real place to stay(besides the car). I guess I always feel a little more nervous about the state of my affairs before I do any physical activity during the day. I think that the endorphins make a big change in my thoughts and state of being. I enjoy physical activity to for the competitive aspect. Recently, I've come to enjoy more extreme sports such as mountain biking, street hockey, and surfing. These sports seem to add an aspect of danger which makes the adrenaline run even faster. It reminds of the Goo Goo Dolls song "Iris" where the singer writes about "bleeding just to know your alive. "  The mixture of hard physical workout and a sense of danger accompanied with adrenaline add color to life where it wasn't there before and give a sense of perspective to other areas of life. I can't help but wonder if this passage is being influenced by the music I'm listening to on the CD player. I think that it's probably still an accurate representation because I don't know  if music can do anything but influence or bring out different parts of yourself. Speaking of music I'm going to play guitar as much as I possibly can now because I've beaten the video game Goldeneye. I'd also like to start writing more. I haven't written in awhile and it's something that I've been missing. The opportunity to be reflective and listen to yourself is a wonderful thing which I haven't been taking advantage of lately. I'd like to publish a book eventually with the sum of a lot of my writing. It would be like a journal of varied types of entries which would open a gateway into the inner recesses of my mind, a window into the core of my being. There are many different enjoyable aspects to writing. In addition to the chance to look at yourself and life, the ability to meld your thoughts into words in the most eloquent way possible is a fabulous thrill. Speaking of acts of creation, I would also like to take more pictures with my new camera. I'm trying to expand my self as a visual artist through photography. I hope to capture a little of the essence of my experiences through the lens of the camera. I took some really good pictures on my last two rolls. The best picture appears to be the result of serendipity. I took a picture at LOCNAME LOCNAME of some of the Indian ruins, and out of the shadows of the rocks, a giant face appears. It's an incredible picture. It's a better picture than I thought I'd ever take. I hope I have the gift of capturing beauty on film. It would be a neat talent to have. 
__label__label0 Every class seems like it has so much extra work, I feel like I  will never have any free time. Other than the work though, I love college compared to high school. I love the freedom I have and even the new responsibilities. Right now everything is still fun, I'm sure though that I will get sick of cooking, cleaning,ironing, and doing everything else by myself pretty soon. I already miss my parents a little and my little sister very much. I can't wait to see her. I feel really bad though, because I promised her that I would come home and see her in two weeks, but I don't think I am going to be able to see her for another week. My mom said she was so excited that I was coming home. She just started second grade and I wish I could have been there to see her. It really sucks that I have to leave her, I feel like we may not be as close anymore if I don't see her as much. She used to beg me every night to sleep in my bed with me and at the time it was kind of a pain, but I really miss it now. I also really miss my boyfriend who is also back in LOCNAME. He came down last weekend, but I don't think I'll get to see him for another week either. He is really taking me going off to college really good. I figured he would be mad at me all the time for hanging out with other guys and stuff, but he has been really cool about it. At first he got really jealous, but we talked about it and now he is completly understanding. I really hope we make it through the year and mabey he can move down here next year!  That would be perfect. Ilive with my best friend so at least I have her here. I think it would be really hard to go to such a big place like ORGNAME and not know anybody. people do it all the time ,but I think  that I would get really depressed if now one I knew and trusted was down here. I really love it down here. Austin is a really awesome town, it has everything!  It is really different from LOCNAME, which is where I come from. It is a small town 00 miles south of LOCNAME. We only have about two stop lights and mabey three fast food places. I think its really great though that I am getting the chance to live in a really small town and a reall big town too. 
__label__label0 It feels like more time has passed and that my life has been turned upside down. Not too badly upside down, but it is definitely different. I had friends come home this weekend and I loved seeing them, but I also realized that college is different for all of us. I noticed changes in my friends that didn't affect our friendships but nonetheless were there. I loved having friends home, knowing I had people to go out with and overall just having a blast. But- it just reinforced the distance between us once they left. I love college and all the new people I've met- I just haven't had the time yet to make the kind of friends I had in high school. I understand this, but it's frustrating to go from always having 00 people to call and talk to down to maybe 0 or 0. I met some people at the Longhorn game on Saturday and it was awesome!  I just hope that that will keep occurring and soon enough I will have those close friendships with people in college. My friends and I also talked for quite a while last night about one of our friends who went to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I've realized that I miss him but at the same time have mixed feelings about that sense of loss. In so many ways I wish he were here but I know that wouldn't be right. It doesn't make it any easier, just a little bit more complicated. I'm also trying to get over my frustration of living at home this year. I feel like out of 00,000 students, I am the only one staying at home with my parents. In so many ways it's not too bad, but when I go out with friends and they can do whatever, come home whenever and so on it makes me realize how much freedom I'm missing out on. A lot of it is that I am sad that I don't have the advantage of meeting people in a dorm and making new friends that way. It's also hard because so many of the people I am friends with are all living on campus and so it's a lot easier for them to get together than it is for me to get together with them. Anytime I have to come up to campus it's at least 00 minutes and a hard time finding a parking place. It just sucks because that's really the only thing I don't like about my college experience so far. It always makes me laugh when they talk about the freedom from your parents that college brings because I don't have that. This is an awful long time to write. I don't really know what else I have floating around in my head and I still have 00 minutes. School work is starting to kind of scare me. It's like oh I have a test in 0 weeks so I don't need to worry about it now and then I know that all of a sudden 0 weeks are going to have passed and I'm not going to be prepared. I love not going to all of my classes everyday. It makes it seem less difficult. The one thing that really sucks about my schedule is the fact that I have these huge breaks between classes. On Wednesdays and Mondays I have 0 hours between classes and 0. 0 between 0 others. The worst part is that I don't know what to do with the time and I can't go to my dorm because I don't have one. I'm starting to hope that the next writing assignment isn't to explain your feelings about college because that's what I've done in this one so I might be stuck at the computer for awhile next time. I'm listening to the Titanic soundtrack right now. I've been listening to it a lot lately. I think it's because it's pretty relaxing and it calms me down. The music is beautiful and it makes me think of the movie. I went to see Titanic twice. The first time the movie cut off in the last part of the movie. It totally ruined the effect and it really sucked because they turned all the lights on and well, you can just imagine. 0 more minutes. I'm really glad that I didn't have to work today. I feel sorry for the people who did have to go up to work on our first school holiday. I work up at the recreation center on campus and I love it. The people there are really cool and now there are some people who are my age. This summer when I worked there, there was no one under the age of 00 except for me. It made it kind of weird because they were all in a stage of life that I had no idea about and won't for at least another 0 years. One of my friends from high school works there and I like having her there. I hate the fact that we don't work together, but hey that's the way life goes. I wish I had more hours simply because that would be something for me to do with my down time on campus. Two more minutes. I never realized how long 00 minutes could be. I've found email to be quite handy with friends because I can email my side of a conversation in about 0 minutes instead of having to go through the pain of writing a letter, putting it into the mail and sending it. I have no mailbox so it makes it even more difficult to mail a letter because I have to go all the way to the post office. Whoever thought of neighborhood community mailboxes with no drop box for outgoing mail needs to be laid off of his or her job. Well looks like my time here is done. I guess I have one more to do but not until tomorrow. 
__label__label1 I just got out of your class after watching the video and I was disappointed that I couldn't do a personality survey. I really wanted to do one. I like to find out things about myself that I might not have been aware of . yesterday I bought a postcard that had my horoscope sign and a description of the characteristics people of this sign have and I thought, as it usually turns out to be, that this card just about pin pointed a lot of the qualities that I have of course a few things were off the mark for goodness sake we are more complex than a few words that tell everyone born within a certain time span who they are, what they should be like, and what they would be good at. I'm really tired I wish I could fall asleep and not have to worry about any assignments. gosh we have to read for every class every day. I'm also taking sociology so a lot of the stuff in psy are the same, but obviously both sciences don't agree. I wonder how I'm going to keep all the facts straight. my soc teacher is boring cause he teaches straight from the book he makes me sleepy at 0:00 in the afternoon how is that possible?  my other classes are cool because teachers teach from the book but insert their own ideas an anecedotes. which I like a lot. I wish I knew how to approach my professors and to just talk to them. I enjoy talking to people but classes this big don't really allow you to. I'm also intimidated by the professors for goodness sake we can no longer say miss or Mr. now its Dr. I am so not used to that. I feel so dumb and in awe by them. maybe that's why I can't figure out a way to approach them. one of my instructors on the first day of class called on me first and I was kind of sleepy and gave a partially correct and that sounded stupid and I heard people giggle. gosh I felt dumb. I still can't forget about it. it's like one of those experiences that everyone else forgets except you and you still think they remember. twenty minutes of writing is a lot of time but I just looked at my watch and I only have 0 minutes to go. I love psy. I love to give advice and find out people's personalities but ironically I'm not trying to pursue a career in that. maybe later I'll change my mind and do it  who knows. all I want is to graduate but it's no longer like high school. now I'm not sure if I'm capable of succeeding. I want to succeed but with A's and without having to  study so much. high school spoiled me got used to getting by with out studying. but now it's a whole new adventure. 
__label__label1 Actually, I am sitting here in the library, wondering how my next four years are going to be. Am I going to excel like I did in high school? or am I going to have an exceptional amount of stress that I will not be able to handle it. I don't know. this whole college thing is so new to me. I just came back from lunch with my roommate and her friends from back home. It's funny because we just had the most bizarre conversation. I just met these guys for the first time and we were talking about how and if one can tell is he or she is in love or not. It's pretty complicated if you really think about it long enough. Sometimes when you meet someone of the opposite you're attracted to them right away. But what really attracts you to that person?  Is it the way they smile? The way they simply look at you?  what is it really?  After it's obvious that the attraction is there you have to move on to the next step. Which, for some people, is the hardest part. It's the whole approaching the person thing. You want to be yourself, but then at the same time you want to do something to impress the person. so you might comb your hair a special way or wear something new. it's the excitement that you like. It's sort of like a sandwich; the bread which is the first step, you the whole chasing thing. the meat is the relationship itself with extreme ups or extreme downs. Finally, the other slice of bread is either the break up or.  It's interesting because two individuals may be in love and might not even know it. That's the neat part I think. but how do we know. I wonder if we will ever know because how do you go about finding out. what type of experiments would you do?  
__label__label1 you would think that by now there would be no pain. ha. also on my mind is the extensive amount of homework that I have to do this evening. I am also very hungry. what am I going to eat? double-daves sounds good. or what about Chinese? god my teeth hurt. I should've grabbed the Advil when leaving the house this morning. Bummer. I would hate to spend another 0 dollars on another bottle but I don't know if I can go all day without it. I am also concerned with the fact that I just did an hour of pretesting stuff and its not connecting with the server. that could be a problem. ill have to ask about that today in class. it did take almost as hour. I would hate for that to be wasted time. this paper I have to write this evening is really stressing me out. PROPNAME PROPNAME and the Puritan dilemma. what a dilemma. actually it is rather interesting the way people thought back in that day. things have certainly changed. gross- I just rubbed my tongue back to that far forbidden corner in my mouth and felt the stitches. ouch. this probing throb is driving me bananas. obviously. I keep losing my train of thought. how will I ever be able to concentrate on john PROPNAME. ill have to wait until I get home and pop a few Advil. or a few hundred as I am feeling right now. just kidding. anyway another thing stressing me out is the fact that my car is in the shop again. I dropped it off this morning and its almost as if my life is in someone else's hands. at least my checking account is. ha, what checking account is more like it. ouch. my freaking teeth. I am going to have to break down and buy some more Advil. that sucks. gosh it's almost 0:00 already. where does the time go? oh yea that pretesting thing and then trying to submit it. I have that it's not lost. maybe I should try and check somehow to see if I can send it through now. well its been twenty minutes. its time to go and get some Advil and relieve my suffering. ORGNAME's is probably the least expensive. it kills me that I have to buy more of that. pain medication is not cheap. anyway enough bitching! lets go over to the pretesting website again. 
__label__label1 I really could care less that I'm doing it at this moment. However, I care about my grade in the class, so that is why I am typing. Lately I've really been curious about the UT environment and atmosphere. It seems to me that everything that an authoritative figure has to say is always an understatement of what is actually expected. For example, one of my professors indicated within a span of less than ten seconds that we should read over chapters one through four for the next session. When I got back to my dorm room I opened the book, thumbing through the chapters, and realized that this man expected the class to read a total of one-hundred and fifty pages in two nights!!  I don't consider myself lazy, but this seemed like quite an astronomical expectation for such a subtle suggestion. College life seems to be okay. I have a lot of free time, but when I really think about it, time flies so quickly that my free time is gone. I like my math class but can't stand the discussion lectures. I feel that they are a complete waste of time, until we actually cover material that I haven't seen. When this occurs, I'm really in for it because I'll be forced to attend the lectures. I really have a hard time understanding the TA, because he gets so excited about math that he talks too fast. People who get excited about math should do the world a favor and jump off a cliff. Just kidding, don't come searching for me because I said a morbid thing like that. My sense of humor is pretty violent. I like it when people have desensitized themselves enough to understand and enjoy that sense of humor that I possess. There is nothing that I can't stand more, however, is someone that totally does not understand my sense of humor and thinks that I am some sick individual. Typing for twenty minutes really sucks. I think I am getting carpal tunnel disease. I've never experienced so much pain in my wrists. I think I am going to slit them right now. with a dull razor blade. Then I'm going to cut my arms off and beat my roommate over and over with them. Once he has experienced maximum horror, I'm going to chop off his leg and leave him there to wither and die and horrible death. Then I'm going to go dive off a bridge onto I-00 and do triple somersault face-plant onto the oncoming traffic. Hopefully I'll traumatize someone in the car and cause them to go off the deep end. I'm just kidding. Would never do such a thing. Anyway, classes are going pretty good, I'm getting a real good taste, as a Freshman, of what college life is all about. I really enjoy having a mission or goal if you will, to get to class, and actually completing it on my own without parent supervision, or guidance, rather. In general, I enjoy the individualistic atmosphere here. However, I have become quite disturbed with the fact that no one talks to one another, perhaps because of pride, shyness, commitment to fulfill an independent lifestyle. Whatever it is, I'm troubled. I have repetitively made eye contact with numerous females on numerous occasions, but they don't look back. I smile but they don't respond. what a bunch of robots. I've never, ever, ever, ever had trouble communicating with the opposite sex before. New challenges await me. Oh well, time's up, hope you've had fun over-analyzing me. Oh wait, my name doesn't really matter, I'm just another statistic, or another number. Got to get used to it. 
__label__label1 I am a sophomore at LOCNAME. I am very excited about doing this assignment because I just received my email account. The whole technology thing really amazes me. I am very excited about taking this class because I am interested in the study of people and how their minds work. I am a little undecided on my major, and who knows:  this may be my calling. Well, maybe!  This is very fun for me being here on the world wide web. I feel like I've been in the dark for so long. I'm sitting here wondering what the people around me are doing?  Are they browsing or doing actual work. My guess is that they're doing important stuff, like I am doing. I'm looking forward to exploring other websites after this because like I said this is my first time on line. Now I can talk to my international friends and actually be in contact with my professors and teaching assistants. I have no idea how I made it through a whole year without an account. I guess that's why I missed a lot of posted assignments. O. K. now my hands are getting tired because it's been a whole summer since I've actually done work. But let me tell you it was a pretty exciting summer. I saw friends that I haven't seen in a while and had some wild and crazy times. I should have gone home to save money, but instead I stayed in a very expensive apartment on LOCNAME LOCNAME and spent all the money I worked so hard for on bills, etc. I am a waitress at Cafe PROPNAME's. It's a bit fun at times, and I make money on occasion. It really makes my whole opinion and view of people change. I mean, I really try to respect everyone for who they are, but when you're constantly waiting hand and foot on a bunch of stingy, angry people it kind of gets you down on people as a whole. It's a fun environment behind the scenes. I have some fun times with some great friends. We goof off and joke around, and we even hang out after work. I'll have to cut back on the hanging out part with school starting again. My boss thought it was a good idea to work me 00 hours this week. So, I'm pulling my hair out here. I'll tell her tomorrow that I cannot work this much while taking classes. I'll have a nervous breakdown. I do need the hours to pay bills, but I might be able to make it with only a few shifts a week. After all waitressing pays pretty good money when the business is there, you know. If all else fails, I'll beg my parents for a loan. whew now my hands are really tired. I realize that this is nothing compared to some of the stuff I will be writing; however, I still need to get warmed up for the semester. God, I can't wait until Christmas break. I love the holidays so much. I'm never in such a good mood as I am then, unless I have just been dumped by the man of my dreams which doesn't happen every year but it does and that is wh0y my feelings towards men is a very negative one. Actually I love the opposite sex, but at the same time I want to kill every one of them. Actually I am just waiting for Mr. PROPNAME and when I settle for Mr. alright for now that's when the crap hits the fan. Well it's been fun but my time's up. I guess I'll visit next time for assignment 0. Later! 
__label__label1 Err:000
__label__label0 But I guess I'm supposed to be trying new things here in college. What's on my mind right now is the question at hand. So I would say right now I am thinking most about what's going on with me socially. I feel like I keep meeting all these girls and I know I'm never going to become more than friends with any of them. People tell me I'm too much of a nice guy and not aggressive enough when it comes to getting girlfriends. But who  really knows what anyone else is thinking or what another person wants. I for one have no clue what other people want from a friend or what a girl would be looking for in me but I guess that's the mystery of life. But it sure seems weird how other people seem to have things all figured out. Like my suite mate gabe, I mean he doesn't have to do anything  and everyone is like I want to be your friend and girls are like please have sex with me. I have a lot of friends but Its like I really want one girl to be more and I can't seem to get from being  friends with a girl to more but maybe its because I haven't met the girl I want to be more than friends with, oh but that's bull shit cause I know I've met plenty of very attractive girls that I would love to get with but never have. but what can I do. It also seems like some weird forces of nature are working against me on the social thing when it comes to girls or I mean my own personal looks, cause I have had a clear of acne face for over 0 months and then right before I move to college KABOOM, it hits me after I go one week without using my prescription cause I ran out. I refilled it but then again it takes awhile to work so I was going through the transitional period then finally a couple days ago i'm truly completely clear and then the next morning I wake up with this huge cold sore on my lip. The biggest monstrous blister right on my lip. that's really going to make me look good for the girls. And right now I still have this blister. I fell like I have to wait for the blister to go away before I ask any girls out like this girl I met at this foam party this weekend. I talked to her on Tues. but we couldn't get together but now I think I may try to wait till this blister goes away before I try to meet with her again anyway. rrGeez, my back hurts right now, hold on a sec while I adjust my seat. there we go. I am really rambling on about the girls situation but I guess that's what's really on mind throughout most of my college days. I also have the work but that just seems like busy stuff to me. to tell the truth psychology is actually so far my favorite class. Not only because there are so many hot girls there but because the actual material I think is cool, like this assignment for one. I might end up writing for way more than 00 min without realizing it. Well in psyche I met this girl PROPNAME and we were walking together to jester and I just truly wonder if we ever become friends, sure we happened to meet and walked together to class one day and sit together but I somehow doubt it will happen again and that's just another example of me just becoming friends, because if I do see her again we will probably only become friends that meet maybe to study or something but I guess having a lot of good looking friends is better than no friends who are girls. back to school though I cla isn't that bad of coarse math is one of my specialties, and chem I like cause I like my professor but physics seems to be the same as high school, a boring monotone voiced professor who doesn't explain things clearly in my opinion, and I know I could get good grades if they just taught from the books cause I have the ability to learn very well but tests don't come straight from the text books do they. so that may pose as a problem, but I have a class in 00 min that I need to start heading towards so now that I've typed for 00 minutes I think ill let you go now, Later. 
__label__label1 so far this freshmen year has been a intereasting adventure if you like S&M. I came down a month early to go with my friends to go to all these fraternity parties and meet a few musicians and audio engineers I have had correspondence with since I recorded my CD. The fraternity parties weren't that great except for a Kappa Sigma one that was pretty wild. I pledged for two days before it hit me that this was a waste of time. Not that waiting in endless lines (with endless hassles) to shell out more money to this fine universtity isn't making me age before my years. I am getting use to the regamorand of rude cafeteria & accounting people and trecking to classes in ORGNAME. I can't say it's all been bad though I did get a free T-shirt and a lot of nefty junk people shove into your hands as you try to walk by. Oh, and then there are the roads with the none existent left turns, constant construction, 00-min limit parking (when you can find it), and cops that stop you for the fun of it. I don't know if its been- oh it gives you more space well then I can continue to ramble. College is supposed to be the best years some say. I think I should of keep better stock in my highschool years. Now except for parties I live like a reclouse in my apartment doing homework for a foriegn language I don't want to learn and trying to write more music while the people above me sound like there having basketball pratice up there. I'm sure it has been atleast twenty minutes by now and if you 've read this far then you're probably ready to quit reading by now. So I'll let you off till I have to write the next one. 
__label__label1 I really miss my home town, but only because I'm not comfortable in my new surroundings. my friends seem short- lived and artificial, and my classes seem all too real and incredibly healthy. I'm constantly worrying that I'll fail and I seem to be hanging out with my thoughts too much, sometimes I feel they are a bad influence on me. I'm only happy when I'm doing something, and people tell me it's because I don't like to deal with my problems. it's true, but at this time I don't care. I have a hard time concentrating, sometimes I wonder if I have ADD. I probably don't , but I like to think I do. they call that a hypochondriac right? I have a question: does  believing you are a hypochondriac mean that you are suffering from something else? I hope so, petty mental problems are better that physical problems. 
__label__label0 I have read for classes almost all day. I can't concentrate on anything that I start to do. I will read a couple of pages, and then I will take a break, or I will do something else. I don't want to get behind, but I just am not motivated at all. I want to have all my reading done for my classes before I go to them. Everyone tells me that it will help me to understand the lectures. I don't want to be catching up all week. I want to try to get my reading assignments for next week done before I go home for Labor Day. I am excited about going home on Thursday. I don't want to have to read anything while I am there. I have not seen my friends for almost three weeks, and I will finally get to see them, not just talk to them on the phone. I don't really talk that long to people in the phone. I have only talked to my best friend three times in the two weeks that I have been here. I feel like I have been in LOCNAME forever. I came to school early for Rush. Sometimes I wish I would not have gone through Rush. I did not get into my first choice sorority, but I got into one with really nice girls. I don't know whether this is something that I want to do anymore. I don't even know if I can get out of it. I just can't wait to go home where life is normal. I just want things to be like they have been all of my life. In the past two weeks, my whole life was turned upside down. I don't feel like I have to stay here. I feel like in the next few weeks this will all be over and I will go back home where I have always been. I do enjoy my classes. Right now, they do not seem to hard,  but I am sure they will get much harder. I only know one person (at the most) in my classes. I feel like I do not have any friends. I meet all kinds of different people, but I would not consider them my friends. Even some of my high school friends are not my friends any more. My best friend all through high school is the only person that I still talk to. I dated my other best friend during high school, and we were finally becoming friends again after breaking up, and then it was time to leave. Now, I find out that he was lying to me about almost everything. I don't understand why he could not tell me the truth. It is not like I care who he dates, but it would be nice to hear it from him, and not from other people. I don't know about other people. All this makes me question all the people who I thought were my friends. I just feel like everything is spinning out of control, and I can't do anything to stop it. I would really like to feel settled here. I want to feel like this is my home. I know that it will take time. I just wish time would elapse quickly. I think things will get a lot better once I get into sorority and school a little more. 
__label__label0 Right now I am feeling a sense that I have a lot of catching up to do in my reading. Not particularly for this subject but for some of my others. my classes thid semester consist of a lot of reading. For the most part I am enjoying school. I think that it will only get better as days go by and I begin to meet more and more people. I am from LOCNAME and hardly any of my friends came to UT. I guess that they all wanted to get away from home. I love LOCNAME and ORGNAME has a wonderful Interior Design program, it is in the school of Architecture. Right now I am in the Arch. library and my typing is kind of loud I hope that it is not bothering anyone. I am about to go to my next class it is an architecture  class with 000 students. Most of my classes except for one are with 000 students. (about 000)  College goes by so quickly I can't believe that it is already thursday. Where does the time go?  Since I am from LOCNAME I have learned that living in austin and attending school in austin are totally different. I am the only family member besides my grandmother who decided to come to LOCNAME. most of my family went to ORGNAME ORGNAME, ORGNAME, and ORGNAME. My sister just graduated college from colorado state in Ft. PROPNAME. I love LOCNAME. My older brother is going to grad school at Ut LOCNAME and working at the same time.  Over the Christmas holiday my sister and I are going to LOCNAME, PROPNAME, I can't wait. Well there is so much I could say right now but I am running out of time. Sorry for all of the mistakes. 
__label__label0 Well, the writing assignment, its 00:00 right now, and I have to write a writing assignment for my psychology class which I absolutely do not see a point in writing this paper. I'm extremely tired from working out and playing basketball, and my stomache is very empty as of now. A few chocholate chip cookies with milk would be nice. Hey, this PCL is full of asians, and right in front of me is My friend PROPNAME's sister, Sorry, I had to pause for a few second to stop and to talk with them. They're pretty cool, she thinks that I talk too loud. well screw her. I wonder if we could use inappropriate languages in this assignment, because my stream of consciousness is one thats pretty dirty and filled with foul language. I better not cuss. Its 00:00, and its very interesting that my brains could only output 00 lines of useless junk in 00 minutes. I feel like that I'm not using my brain to its full potential. Or Maybe I'm just a very slow typer. Damn, my wrist hurts, I'm so glad that I only have 0 classes tomorrow. Intro to western music is such a crappy class. I thought it was suppose to be a blow off but its not, and its pissing the living (explisive) out of me. I'm tone deaf, I'm dumb as hell when it comes down to music, and I'm plain retarded when I have to distinguish the difference between a duplet, triplet, or quatriplet. In my opinion, not that it really matters in the bigger scheme of things, but its still best to be aired out, is that music should be enjoyed by an individual, not to be dissected into grammarical structures. The class kinda reminds me of "Dead Poet Society" how the text books actually graphs the meter and accents of the poem. Music, like poetry, suppose to be heard by the heart not interpreted by the brain. When I hear PROPNAME's 0 th symphony, I can't tell the meter and texure of the piece, but all I know is that My heart are soaked with energy that makes the musical experience quite elemertary yet much more enjoyble. I guess I should quit my bitching to that class, since its I, myself who signed up the class without any foreign intervention nor pressure, so who should I blame but myself. I just saw PROPNAME's friend walking in the liabrary. Why didn't I say hello, just because the way he looks, is he not cool enough. When we went to that frat house last weekend, I feel like that he's such a burdensome tag-along. Yet would some of my other friend feel the same about me??  Its very disturbing, how I'm disgusted by all those people who think they are too cool for certain peeps, yet I fall under the same disgusting catorgory which I loath. It's so confusing, when I heard from Say that He's not coming to the thursdsay mixer, I was some what relieved. relieved of what?? of people not thinking that I'm a cool frat boy, beacause of PROPNAME, but who really cares what those Lambda thinks? or those skanky PROPNAME PROPNAME girls think??? Why do I care so much about what other people think, instead of thinking for myself and doing something that I know is right. It bugs me how I proclaim my self to be a "genuine" nice guy, when I can't even perform the easiest task of bring somebody along with me and having a good time with him. Damn, I'm so freaking superficial and it annoys the heck out of me. "To really discover yourself, before discovering that really special someone"  Right now, I don't think I deserve her. I just hope that she doesn't come right now, and wait for me to mature and evovle into a better person. The loud, oversized vacumm cleaner is distracting my flow of thoughts, and my brain kinda froze for a sec. I think those few clear moments where you're brain is not thinking anything at all, is one of the healthiest state a human can be. Well, as another vacuum cleaner joins the Library noice parade, I shall conclude this essay. I have to admit though, despite my early feelings, this assignment has some enjoybal value to it, and I'm actually kinda glad that I'm given this blank sheet that I can send my thoughts, into the void of carelessness, and its rather refreshing. I bid you farewell. (though I don't know who I'm bidding to)  Its 00:00. 
__label__label0 right now I'm a little bit stressed anb  about getting all my homework done that is do on friday due tommorrow  and getting enough sleeop at the same time  never enough time   too much to due too little time  I also need to clean up my room and do the dishes. I should also say that I only have one arm to type this because the other one is in a cast so I probably wont write as much as everyone else. although have a lot of homework to do tonite, I'm happy because I only have one class tomorrow and then the weekend is here and I don't have any classes to go to. I'm also happy that this is such an easy assignment and that we get credit for it. my roomate is bothering me quite a bit at the moment cause he wont shut up. I really don't like him very much, but at least he is just my roomate and I don't have to hang out with him. now I hope that he doesn't see what I wrote. I'm excited about this weekend cause it will be time to get away from school. I don't know or care what I'm doing though. maybe I shouldnt feel this way so early in the year, but I just don't feel like doing all of the work I have to do for school, I would rather just sit in the living room and watch tv and relax. I'm tired now and I feel like going to sleep, but the nthought of my math hw wont let me relax until it is all done. now I'm wondering if someone is actually going to read all of these writing assignments, I feel sorry for whoever has to do that, but I guess they are divided up between the ta's. my twenty mins is almost up so I'm thinking about what I'm goin g to write for the next ass. well twenty mins is up now, so goodbye. 
__label__label0 Today was a very long and exhausting day. I began by waking up at 0:00, after only 0 hours of sleep, to go to a 0:00 Art History discussion lab at the museum. It actually crossed my mind to skip class and then go back to sleep, that way I wouldn't be as tired as I am right now. But instead I decided to go ahead and go to class, otherwise I would just fall behind and not know what happend. Personaly, I am not one to really like getting behind, so I think that I made the right decision, granted I may be tired right now, I know my decision to go to class will pay off in the long run. As my day continued, I went to the actual class lecture for  Art history. It was somewhat interesting, although I found it a little difficult to consentrate. I guess that may be because I did not catch up on my reading that I was supposed to have completed by today. Obviously I am paying for the ocnsequenses of not keeping up with the outside responsibilities. Futhur in the day, I went to the dentist to get a filling,  which was not fun!  The right side of my mouth was numb for about 0 hours. That may not sound like too long, but in reality, when your mouth is numb and you can't talk well, and you can't eat or drink anything because you will spill it, it is a long time. Then I proceeded to go to a meeting. I had previously told my room mate that she was able to use my computer while I was gone. This kind of bothered me just because I payed for this computer and I could have just relied on her supplying the computer and used hers. I just don't really think that that is fair. Then what really irritated me, which doesn't happen too ofter, is that when I came back from the meeting, the stuff that was in my chair that she sat in was thrown all on the floor. My brand new shirts that are not even two days old, my purse, and my shorts, were all on the ground. Now it is one hting to use something of someones and put everything back where you found it, but to be so inconsiderate as to not put things back in it's place is rude. I was quite mad, so instead of confronting her, I just left and went to get ORGNAME and to watch tv with my sister. I guess you could say that I did it to get out of confronting her and to also blow some steem off. Oh well, what's done is done, but next time I think that I just might have to say something to her(if I let her use my computer next time). Well, that was pretty much my day, and now I am just trying to get caught up with all of my responsibilities and homework, which is making me stressful. I know that I will be relieved when I finish it all, though. 
__label__label0 Right now I am kind of in pain. Someone feel backwards in their chair and fell on my leg and scraped it. It stings a little, but it will be okay. I've been trying to do the pre-testing, but it won't let me on. I'll try to do it later. I like the internet because it is great that I can look things up on it. It's cool that I can look at notes from my classes. It's a good thing, but yet I still hate it because I do not have a computer and my roomates is not working for some reason. It is really annoying because I have to leave my room to get on the internet. It is also a pain because I can never get on when I want to. Like the pre-testing that I just tried to do, why can I never get on?  Oh well, I guess I will have to try later. My roomate and I are really getting along great. The only thing that is a problem is that she goes to bed at 0:00 at night. I can't go to sleep that early. Last night I had homework and she did not. I felt so bad because I had lights on and was making noises. I feel bad, but if I have homework I can't worry about her. so far, I really like ORGNAME. My mom wanted me to be an Aggie, but I decided I would much rather be a Longhorn. My mom thinks this school is to bg for me. She thinks I have the personality of an Aggie, because I am so shy. My mom even offered to pay for a sorrority so I would make friends. My mom can't even afford this school. I think I have made a lot of friends though. I am shy, but it's not like I am mute. I am afraid that my mom is going to be really lonely now that I am gone. She is the only one in the house and does not go out with her friends much. My sister lives close by, but is to busy. She is the total opposit of me, she is a social butterfly. She is 00, but acts 00. I heard that you can use your meal plan money at the Jester store, I wonder if it's true. If it is that would be really cool. I could really go for some pizza right now. I should go to the store and get some frozen pizzas. That would be good for Sunday night when the cafeteria is closed. I think the Kinsolving cafeteria is better than Jester's. They have a great selection and the pizza is really good there. There is one guy that works there that is really nice. He is allways smiling. I think it's cool that they have ice cream there. I love ice cream sandwiches. They are really good. It was hard to decide if I wanted to live in Jester or Kinsolving. The rooms are much nicer at LOCNAME than at Jester. I love the big window. Jester has a tiny window and the walls are pale. Jester on the other hand has a great location. It is close to everything and everyone lives there. You allways run into people you know and it's easy to get a bunch of friends together for lunch and dinner. I feel bad because I got my roomate sick, and 0 of my friends. oops!  Well I have three minutes left. I wanted to go home this weekend, but I can't. I did'nt go last week because of the football game and my sister came to visit. I can't go home this weekend because my ride's car's air-conditioning broke. I know noone will take me home next weekend because of the football game. I wonder if I'll ever get to go back home!  Both of my parents are coming for parent's weekend. I wonder if they get to sit with me at the football game. I wish I had a computer, it would be so much easier. Well my time is up and I really have to go to the bathroom, so I guess I will go now. Bye!   
__label__label0 There is a girl named amy who annoys me very much. We used to be very good friends until I found her true personality. PROPNAME;s personality is hard to relate to which makes her hard to get along with. She only does things that help her or make her look better. For example, she will only become friends with people who benifit her or make her look cool. PROPNAME requires shopping. She shops at least once a week. Her shopping habbits drive me insane. PROPNAME cares so much about how she appears to other that it hides her true personality. She acts like the person she wants to be but will never become. PROPNAME is a smart girl but that is not obvious in a conversation. She acts oblivious to the current events and common knowledge.  Being at college and having a girlfriend at home is a hard task to handle. Eventhough it is tough to do, it sounds a lot worse than it actually is. While I do not see my girlfriend half as much as I am used to, I can still call her everyday. While phone conversations are not physicall confromtations, they do help in easing the pain of not having her around all the time. By being apart for extended periods of time, when I do end up going home to visit, the benefits are rewarding. The time spent together then is more special than any other time I have spent with her before. Because we both know our time is limited, we seem closer during my home visits. It is some of the only times when we think on the same level. Both of our plans include us spending time together. Eventhough I would much rather be at home with her, I am glad we made the choice to stay together while I am at college. Next year I can only hope that she decides to attend UT. It would ease a difficult stage in our relationship. 
__label__label0 I have a stuffy head and runny nose, and I have to carry cleanex around with me and it;s kind of embarassingf to vlow your nose in class and its feels gross and clogged. I look for nice looking peoople to sit next to in class and I feel like eceryione feels the same way about being here, like its all brand new and and no one is totally comftorable and we're all looking for a place to be comftorable. there are a bunch of girls around her ea and its funny how little contact with guys I've had in the past couple of weeks. I miss the guys in knew and was friends with in highschool and danny but I don't really miss him, but id like to see him again and talk to him. the guys here are pretty much attractive but I guess that since I'm in a new world I walk around t\afraid to talk to anyone really except for nice looking girls. I've met people, but I am totally stressed out and I'm going a bunch of different directions, and I can't focus on anybody and I can't calm myself down. veronica is comingf up today or tomorrow for a visit and I wonder how it will be especially since I've been so stressed out. I can't believe I slept for over nine hours and I don't feel completely rested. it totally understand how people pay for caffeine pills here, because this is only the third day of class. excercise will help relieve my stress I think, so I'm going to kickboxing in a little while. the only thing about that is I don't even know where the damn building is, and I have to run past this strange campus past a million strange people to take a brand new class I've never been to, and I;ll probably feel guilty because I haven't even started to stud0y yet. I know ill be ok but right now I'm making it very hard for myself to have much fun. I wonder what I'll we'll do tonight? I really want a zeta to call me and ask me to go out. even though its c razy I would have loved to be dragged out of bed and taken out to eat at six in the morning, but no one every came for me, and as far  as I know no one ever called for me either. its a good thing because I needed to work out and sleep like I did and not drink. its even a wednesday and they took us out to party hardy, I don't know how these fgirls can run, because they even look fgood and have boyfriends and make food grades and go out and study and sleep. I guess its all time management and I'l;ll e\definately be forced to learn it, at least I have tom ake mysels learnit ior ill go crazy. I want to go call a zeta and hjand out with her because we will be friends one day and probably be partyingh together four years from now, hopefully. I think the purpose of a sorority must be not so much to give you a place as a freshman, whichis nice and it does do, but it makes a small close world for you of very cool poeople when you are a sopjomore and a junior. I don't know how much I would want to be conected to the sorority my senior year, but just the girls and the people I had met from being a part of it. it think  it would be somewhat like cheerleading was, where by your junior and esp senior year you aren't really interested int he younger girls, and you really do your own thing. but that owould be awesome anyway because at that point hopefully I;ll be absorbed into my new life and begining a career. I have to miss the first ut football game!!I wish the zetas had a section, but maybe I can go to the tailgate party anyway if I find someone to go with, and veronica will bve here. I hope when she leaves I don't geet homesilck like I did nwhen momm and the fgirls came up. I can't believe I've really only talied to daddy once since I left san antonio. he sent me a nice letter and a nicer jchekc but too bad that a hundred dollars won;t go to o fast. being at ut in austin I dfeel like I'm in a totally different world, and I ,\can really see whant they meant about not having the time or interest to go visit other campuses. I just htought about how much fun it will be to go to aand m tosee the cross country team run, but it feels like it would take monumental organization and effort to bget up there, especially not having a car. onely four more minutesleft to type. imi liking this assignment because it reminds me of the creative writing class wiht mrs cummings nadnd how I enjoued myself in there and the free writings we would have which got easier and easier to do as the time went on, and I culd see myself more and more on the paper,and the way my thoughts went. I really like journaling but its uncomfroable to werite and I walways stop to do it late at night when I'm tired and if I do it in the morning it is eems like I get latzy and don't want to get out of bed aftereards, and I have to re read it and see all the obsesive stuff about brett wihich I am forgetting forutunately and unfortunatley. the way it isi I'm glad I don't have a boyfriend, bnot because I can run around a nd get play or do stuff with guys, but v\beecause it hink it would hadd another huge element of stresssand I really don't need that right now. I thought vivian is so gorgeous and her bf is not that cute. andni told bvern to say hi to jason for me, hut to just because I liked him and thought he was a nice guy but not because I was interested or flirting at all, or had been thin,king babout him. now the says she told him he shoul come to austin with reza, and that would be fun, but I'm thinking kind of weird too, and I don't reallywant to party with reza or old high school friends if I'm there only because of veronica and jason who lives in san antonio. I know I'll have a fun weekend because thats the only option up here, but I hope I get lots of sleep too. all done 
__label__label1 WOW!  Time goes by fast. Here I am doing my college homework and it seems as  though just the other day I was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in  elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you  know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in  college. Time flies and friends come and go. I have met so many people since I  have been at this enormous school. I have come to realize that you must take  initiative in order to succeed. For instance, I am currently majoring in  theatre, but I don't know if that's what I really want to do with my life. If I  don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far I can go, I  will never figure out if theatre is the way I want to go or not. Then there's  the question of what I'd do if I didn't major in theatre. I know that I  wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 0rd time I've had to  write this since I have had many computer troubles. I accidently erased the  first one and my friend's computer froze when I was writing the other one. I am  using my friend PROPNAME's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. Right now I'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from ORGNAME, and they're  talking about PROPNAME's hair. Some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he  doesn't want his hair cut. They think it looks like an 00s haircut but he begs  to differ. Anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. I just remembered that I have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my  room. I hope it's not stale. Maybe I can drink it with my over-do milk. It's  past the drinking date. This gum is very stale and I am getting hungry. If I  were in my room, I would eat my muffin or the chips that I didn't eat last week  because I had to get to class. You see, I feed the birds my second sandwich  because I'm full. Then I still have chips left over. Oh, well. The joys of  wednesday sack lunches from Towers. I'm used to sack lunches because I've eaten  a sack lunch every day in high school. The reason is that we eat in the  greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. Some of my friends  have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers  get mad. Ah, the good old days. PROPNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME want to order a  pizza. That sounds like a good idea. It's late and I have to get up early for  my intro to media class tomorrow. College is a time when it seems hard to get  any sleep. There's always something you've got to do, or just good old  fashioned procrastination. I mean, I don't procrastinate. This isn't even due  for another week or so, and here I am, already typing it for the 0rd time. PROPNAME  PROPNAME is on TV right now. I just learned that his CDs have a parental  advisory due to explicit content. Isn't that interesting. Funny how society  tries to censor our lives when in reality children are the currupt ones these  days. Like my friends. they're crazy. Children are exposed to so much, like  from TV. I never had cable growing up, so I don't know what it's like. We did  have channel 00, ORGNAME. That was nice. Now, we're listening to the Doors, which  reminds of A Midsummer Night's Dream because my high school did it in the 00's  and that was the music we used. Well, at least, we used some Doors music. We  used great 00s music. Then I was in A Midsummer Night's Dream in the 00s, and  we used original music written by one of the cast members. He wrote the tune  for The Wiz, and tranfered the words because of course PROPNAME didn't write  like the music in The Wiz. PROPNAME just called a guy because his number was on a  dollar bill. He's crazy, but that is what makes life fun. Then there's PROPNAME  with his mushroom haircut and PROPNAME, who some say looks like PROPNAME PROPNAME, but in  reality, he looks nothing like PROPNAME PROPNAME. No more than the pizza guy, who  looks like a clown. I am afraid of clowns and I haven't even seen "IT. "   However, I did see a PROPNAME PROPNAME movie on New Years a couple years ago with 0  girls from LOCNAME. New's Years Day was 00 hours for me because I was  traveling back from LOCNAME. That was a great trip. Well, it's been 00 minutes  and I feel like there's not much else needed to say. "Good morning, and in case  I don't se 
__label__label1 I am very famished right now. I just got back from the psychology class. My stomach is gnawing, and I feel the grinding emotions. I haven't been very energetic the whole day. I almost fell asleep in my calculus class today. This is terrible, because I have never really gotten that tired in high school before. It always just seemed to be the calculus class that I almost fall asleep in. I am very frustrated at school. It is not only that I am a freshman, and that I am still trying to adjust to college life, but it is also due to my classes. For example, I have a biology class, with an excellent professor. However, his teaching assistant is making me really upset, because he can't really speak english. He is Indian, and I am sure he must be very intelligent, but I cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. I understand him on that basis, because I am after all a foreign student, and 0 years of high school have really changed my speaking capabilities. But I guess the older one gets, the harder it is for them to learn and adapt to new things. Anyway, I was vexed too, because he would not explain the questions asked by himself, but he would ask the class to input their answers. I understand that he wants the class to participate as a whole, but he can't just rely on students' answers. After all, we are just as confused. Math class is almost the same, except my math teacher speaks better than him. But Math has always been a tough area of subject for me. I have a bad history of math, and therefore I think that class is prone to my exhaustion. My professor is explaining math thoroughly, and he is very helpful and good, but my dislike for math overcomes me. I know that it is mind over matter, and that if I try to psyched myself to like math, I could probably get to put my energy into it. Don't get me wrong. I have always been a good student. I was valedictorian of my high school, and my high school is one of the best in LOCNAME. However, there are always some flaws even to the perfect, because no one is infallible, and I tend to procrastinate. This in the end results in my fears now. I am getting so nervous every day, because I am behind in my reading of assignments, and I am   worried that some professors are going to spring out pop-quizzes on me. I  also noticed that I not only tire so easily now, but my attention span has also increased, and my thoughts wander so much to the insignificant matter. I can't seem to concentrate reading in my room, when all the food, bed, noises, and I guess everything seems to distract me. Also, I have never been in a relationship before, not even dating, and in college, I thought it is where one may start for me. I often find myself looking out for guys. Even if I do get into one, I am sure that I will not do anything to jeopardize my future. I really want to be a doctor, and I am right now very worried about medical school. I really want to enter ORGNAME, and I am rather mad that they deferred me during early decision, and didn't admit me during spring decision. I guess I am being irrational here, but I did harbor the hope that I could get in because of the deferral. But that stumbling block will not trip me, I will still continue to work hard in college, get out with a 0. 0 ORGNAME, and hopefully a high ORGNAME score, and hope that I can apply to ORGNAME and get into med school. That would be a very nice, ultimate dream that I would ever want to fulfill. I am very hungry right now, and I am having a major headache trying to think if I should double major in something, because it is not wise just to major in biology, and think that everything including medical school will be smooth for me. I think I will visit my advisor on Friday.     
__label__label1 Okay, my thoughts. a jumble right now, let's see if I can sort them out. My feelings are peaceful array, overwhelmed, giving God praise and glory for His awesomeness. I just looked at a person, just looked at his face, tried to figure out if he was good-looking or not and then punished myself for doing it because I have a guy, I need to stop looking at others. Or do I, confusion is going on in there right now but also a  peace or something that is covering over all of it. Put there by God I know His truth will come out in time. I am suppressing something, a feeling I have a lot. Suppressing emotions, bad things, allowing myself to think of something??  I don't know, is it a discipline to control the mind. deep down is that constant. God is there watching loving taking care of me, His will is at the center, my will fighting with His will, but another side of me so wanting Him  to take over and control my whole life. I am tired, but why?  I slept in until 0:00a. m. today, I shouldn't be tired, I wonder if the sky and weather outside have anything to do with it??  a little bit down. i didn't hear from LOCNAME today yet. always that little doubt, is he given up?  but I doubt but deep deep down I know ther is something there holding it so strong, or stopping me from worrying and getting taken over by it, a holding on so hard to God and knowing that what He has deemed right and true will come for I have given Him my life to be in control of . Why did that Psychology test ask such dumb questions?  I mean about sex and just assuming that everyone has had it and asking about it. I feel a little bit dirty considering and thinking about those different types of sex there are. I am pure, a virgin and I plan to stay that way until marriage. It is so sad, but those types of people must be rare in the world today, I have been secluded from the real world it seems, well kind-of, not too much. Actually what is the real world. I'm thinking and holding onto the fact that actually the way God sees things is the real world. We can blind ourselves so easily to what is real and fake and what really does or doesn't matter. People care so much about nothing. things that won't last things that won't follow aor come with them after they die, now I'm getting bored with this subject but I want to finish it out. I so desire my roommates to come to know Christ. I am worried about my witness and just as I live what I portray, today's society doesn't care about who or what you worship, oh it's all good , hey that's great you believe in this and she in that and I in this. How sad is that, the truth is God,  but also people won't accept that unless God is there working , what does convince a person to become a Christian or is that the right words to use, now onto camp, a picture of the campfire with boys all around it, the orange nice comforting mysterious warm flames in the middle of a set of logs and as I approach it down the steep hill I hear jabbering and talking and I see the beautiful red, orange, pink cloud overhead, how is that so beautiful?  How do those colors come out?  I don't know, but it  is awesome!  then I see the staff, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME (she most prevelently), PROPNAME, and others. then I sit next to PROPNAME and my heart just warms up, I don't know what to say or where  to look and I'm just glad I'm next to him, we can't touch, don't let the kids know that we are dating, it would be better if they didn't know about this, PROPNAME had said,  okay, with God's help I can behave myself. It's not that hard to make myself do something, good. We sit there and I just glance at him and his one yellow and blue eye and his other blue eye, how in the world did someone so handsome and with so much integrity and love come to want me and want to date me and care for me. I don't know, I have no idea about myself, it's just me and though, me , a continuous struggle and fight to let God rule and reign or me to take over. Again how is Christ going to shine. I don't want to change with god and though deep down he is there and it seems nothing will change that, but how do I know what will happen in the future?  I don't, but the one person I do know and is always there is in the future now and knows. all-knowing, all-powerful, everywhere, God!! Not myself, I can't ever be god I am so fallible and a sinner!  Only God!  Okay, just looked at the clock and actually I am enjoying this writing all my thoughts. At the beginning I was skeptical of this whole assignment. why should I focus on myself?  anyway, it is fun to put into words my thoughts and interesting what I actually think about within 00 minutes. It seems a lot of PROPNAME and of God and issues. These are my thougts for the last 00 minutes. Hmmm! :) 
__label__label1 At this moment I am worried about completing this assignment. The main cause of my concern is that I am using a friend's computer. I do not own a computer and therefore it is very difficult to have access to class notes and homework assignments. I have never really dealt much with computers, so I am not very familiar with this type of technology. I have tried various times to seek help in a public librar, but I was unaware that a long process of aquiring an account and finding a payment plan (if I want to print) was required. This is especially hard for me because many of my classes offer class information on the web. Now proceeding to my next concern, tomorrow I have a major french exam. After finishing this assignment I must hurry to my apartment and eat lunch, then return to school. I have no idea what I will eat for lunch, but I must eat at home. Last weekend my parents came down from LOCNAME to visit me. They swore that I had lost some pounds and that I must not be eating healthy. My parents worry about my health very much. Being from a hispanic background, education is not of importance. My father threatened to take my out of school if I did not start taking care of my health and house duties. My father believes that a woman's future is in the kitchen. He never realy supported me in my college education. In his own words, he didn't think I "would make it in the real world". My mother begged me to stay close to home and attend a community college. I refused because I am very ambitious and much of a dreamer. I wanted to attend a well-known university (ORGNAME) and nowhere else. I worked hard for 00 years to get this far. I did it with very few support from my parents . I encouraged myself to achieve everything I have. Perhaps it is better this way because my parents let me become independant and able to have my own dreams. They knew that if I achieved all my dreams, it would be because only I worked for it. Knowing that you made it almost alone gives a sense of immense satisfaction and self-worth. 
__label__label1 Okay, I am very frustrated right now. I just tried to complete the pretesting survey and I was unable to get on to the web site. I tried for a long time and it still wouldn't work. Anyway, I have so much work to do and I don't feel like doing any of it. And just thinking that I have my economics class at 0:00AM tomorrow doesn't make me feel any better. I can't wait until my weekend comes. This past weekend was awesome. My friends came up to visit me for the whole weekend and we went out and stuff. My boyfriend, who I haven't seen in about a month, also came up with one of my best friends on Sat. I was really happy. Gosh!!! I am really uncomfortable in this chair at this desk. I have to put the keyboard in my lap because we don't have anywhere to put it. my back is hurting. my roomate looks like she's really comfortable in her bed while I'm here all twisted in my chair trying to type. I wonder why I'm having trouble thinking of things . It should be easy to just type whatever comes to my head, but, it's like my mind is not all here. I can't believe that I almost lst my key today. I got home after being gone to two cclasses and I realize that my key is gone. I don't have fifty dollars to just throw away. I wish I was kind of rich. no, not rich just better off than I am right now. I would just like to live comfortably. with just a little extra cash in my pocket. ouch ! my back is really bothering me right now. maybe after I finish this I should go and check if I can get on that pretesting thing again. waht is I keep haveing trouble with it?  and, what if I never get it to work?  then what?  well, maybe I can go to somebody elses computer to do it. I wonder if it's the computer that is not working. I don;t know . but then again, I'm also computer illiterate. I can't bele\ieve that 00 minutes have not gone by yet. ohhh, I;m so tired. I still have to do more homework and I'm sleepy. I'm also getting kind of lazy to go work out, but, I have to go because I missed this whole past weekend. I feel like I'm getting fat even though I eat salads and baked potatoes   every day. the jester food is gross. ooh, that late night food last night was so gross. It was extremely greasy. eating that stuff on a regular basis can make you really fat in no time. I hope I don't gaing those freshman fifteen . that would suck. I don't' want to gain any weight at all. I've seen too many peaple come home really fat after just a few months of coolleege. I'm really tired of typing already and I really want to stapo. I can't even spell anymore. I really hate thursdays. I have too much stuff to do on thursdays. my day is ruined at 0:00 when I have to go to economics . from then on it's jsut hell. then biology is really long. it's not a bad class it's just really loong. 
__label__label0 college isn't as easy or as bad ass as I was expecting,  with katie back home I can't stand not being ablble be with her or mess around, I know I'll prob end up[ screwing it up,  I know I kindof want  to date other people but I can't stand the thought of her being with another guy, I really do care about her but I know in the long run we aren't going to end up together but it is still hard to end it or change things plus the way we alwys fight it sux.

__label__label0 Right now I am feeling very stressed out with all of the work and reading that my professors have given me. In my Language of the Stage class my teacher gave my about 00 pages to read and take notes from and we have to discuss the reading this Friday. It has alredy taken me a good long while to take notes on the first 00 pages. I don't know how I am going to read the rest. I am almost thinking that I should just not do it but if I did that I would feel very guilty about myself for not doing it. So I think that I am going to be pulling an all nighter trying to finish reading and taking noes on the materials. I just think that the work he put on us is a little harsh. That is a lot of work. Now my best friend from home was going to come stay with me one night this weekend. I was so excited because I haven't seen her since we both left for school, but now she is not coming but all of her friends that go to school with her now are going to come. I am so upset because I really wanted to see her. She is going back home to see her family instead. I know that she wanted to come stay with me but she just couldn't but I really wanted her here because I know that we would have had so much fun together and I wanted her to meet all of my friends. Oh well, I know that she will come to see me soon I hope. Well so far I have had a really good time here at school. I have become friends with a lot of cool people and my sister is here also. The only problem is that I have been going ouit almost every single night and it is really wearing me down. It's like I wnat to make good grades in school but I also want to go out and meet new people. I am also a Pi Phi here and so there is always something we have to do during the week. I really need to cut back on going out all the time and try to get some good sleep. I also need to start working out again because I don't want to gain weight and I am really afraid about that. I also want to work out just so that I feel good about myself and feel like I have done something productive for the day. I hate feeling like a slob and that is what I have felt like lately. Well I am having so much fun but I really miss my friends that aren't here. Only a couple of my friends are here but I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know everyone even though it can be hard when you don't know many people already. 
__label__label1 Hello, well I'm writting my stream of consciuness at a friends room because the  ethernet at my room does not function as of yet. So here I am pondering as to what to say. It angers me that I have not been able to log online at my apapartment yet. i intead to call the ethernet people and ge the situtation rectified but as of yet I have not had ample enough time to properly do that. Well, school is pretty cool so far so I don;t have much to complain about, I just ate lunch and suprisingly the school cafeteria food isn't that bad, in fact it sort of is pretty good, they have nice burgers and I always pile on the tabasco like the bastard I am. Twenty minutes is quite a long time, I bet my response here would be more interresting if I was under the influence of some intoxicating something or other, not that I do that sort of thing, but who really cares right?  I seriously doubt anyone is reading this and if you are then I send out a hearty "hey hey hey". Well hey, anyways,b back to the subject at hand wich is nothing except for the monotomous and endless stream of infinity that flows through my veins like a vapor of the serpent that eats tiny little fleas that impend on the consciouness of the letter better red little ant eater. Oh hey, are you following my consciouness?  Or are you thinking that I have lost my mind in the impending fires of infinity that ingulf the ebb and tide of an ocean tht haas not yet come to grips wit hthe reality that condesends to the vast pits of a sub-world burried in the truths of a mad man who has lost all sense of truth,  pity, and denial, opting aptly for the tools osf self destruction and the endless orgasm of the inevitable ghost. So we can fully understand our prophets. who cares?  who cares about the subtle truths that we seek to uncover in I various means of apathetic lethargy?  perhaps we schould quote some famous scholar and then abolish our reason with the tip of a hat a cigar made from banana leaves?  Where have our morals gone today?  Where is the profanity in a language that adulates the adoration of adulturation and the abominal abortion of the spirit of the infite wisdom burried in the truths of an incoharant lunatic rambling at the sppeed of a jack rabbit copulating wit hthe pourpouse of my reasoning. Well I ponder if it's been twent ymintues yet, and I think that it indeed has so I must depart with a hearty hand shake and in the words of the infinite wisdom of the great and all mighty pooh bear, say ta-ta for now. take it easy and such. where is the party in the silent room?  Indeed if you know won't you please come and joing me. All is ripe for the tacking. So long for now. 
__label__label0 Right now at this moment, I am thinking about what I am doing here. This whole college thing is still new to me. My roommate is getting drunk right now with some guys, while I am in here writing this. At least she is meeting people. I wish I could go back in time, and be in high school again. I know that probably sounds stupid and immature,but I had a lot more fun in high school. I had friends all around me, I was popular, I was really close to the cutest guys in our school. Now, I do not know anyone. I am used to going out like everyday, so it is really weird to be actually doing my homework. You know what I really miss?  This guy back in LOCNAME named PROPNAME. He was a complete ***hole, but I was and still am infatuated with him. I guess it is infatuation. I would like to think I love him, but I know that logically it is not possible for me to love him. He was my first you know. I am one of those Catholic girls, and I never thought I would lose it to some stupid high school boy. But, it happened. I wish that it would have happened, and I would not have had any feelings for him, but I do. He has a girlfriend who is younger than we are, and I am insanely jealous. Why could he establish a relationship with her, and not me. And why is it that he cheats on her with me?  These questions boggle my mind and make me upset. I know I deserve better. I am one of those Catholic, upperclass, spoiled girls. I have everything but what I want. PROPNAME goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME and is far away, but no one here has even caught my eye. I thought once I went to school, my life would just be incredibly better. Well, it really has not. College is not what I thought it would be. I know it is only like the middle of the third week, so I need to give it time. Freedom is great, though. I like not having to check in with the paternals. What is the great thing about that if I never use that priveledge. I am also thinking about how my psychology class is during a bad time. I mean class is at 0:00 and that is about the time I want to go to my dorm and sleep or just relax. I wish I could change my time, but it is too late now. Oh well. Also, I think that PROPNAME PROPNAME is the hardest building to get to. I missed class today, because I could not find it. I hope we did not do anything important. I hate Chemistry!  Dr. PROPNAME goes too fast and does not make sense. I don't know if I can survive that class. It is going to be tough. I am used to sleeping in all my classes, never doing homework, and just getting by. That was high school, this is college. How I miss those good old days. I really do not think I am ready for college. Everybody here is just so smart. I really miss having people who are dumber than I am in classes. Now it seems I am the dummy. The next time I do this, hopefully I will be in a better mood. My twenty minutes are almost up, and I have ran out of things to say. I hope this was interesting and different from all the other assignments that you have recieved. Bye for now. 
__label__label1 I'm going nuts. I haven't gotten anything done today except a shower. I didn't get my parking permit. I really need to get that so I can have my car on campus. That would make my commute to work in north LOCNAME a lot less painful. I can't stand riding the bus back and forth. I never know exactly when the bus will arrive. If I'm not there right on time, I get stuck for another half hour or so. I just really want my car here. I also didn't get my Physics books returned. They cost me approximately $000, and they're doing me no good. I'm being booted out of my physics class cause I didn't take calculus. I didn't know until last week that calculus was even a prerequisite. That's ok, though. I didn't really want to take physics this semester anyways. I kinda like this basic, cool class schedule I have. I did get in touch with the guy in charge of the anthropology department, so I can add that cultural anthropology class that I wanted. I hope that will be a cool class. I hope I'm not really far behind since I missed the first two weeks of class. It sounds interesting though. I need to get this class to stay a full-time student. If I'm not, my financial aid will disappear. I also need to get a work/study job for my financial aid. That's another thing I could have done today, but didn't. I went in for an interview at the counseling and mental health center with a ORGNAME ORGNAME, but she never showed up. That was very discouraging. There are a few others that I'm interested in. I like the idea of doing nothing for $0. 00/hour. I could be an Entrance Monitor at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Weee! What fun. I don't think that will happen though. I just would like to have a job on campus so I can walk there rather than having to take a bus there or to my car and then drive there. That would be so much of a hassle. And, knowing me, I'd be late a lot. I just wish I could work somewhere on campus. It would make my life easier. I will miss my current job at Sunglass Outfitters. I really like my boss, and my co-workers are pretty cool. I also work right next door to a Thundercloud Subs where I get free food when the night manager's there. He's a really cool guy. He has had a glass eye since he was 0. He's got some crazy stories about that eye. One time when he was 0 he replaced the eye with a cherry, stem and all. He scared the hell out of his grandmother because the stem was just sticking out of his head. It was pretty funny. His girlfriend one time made the mistake of asking him to keep an eye on her books. You can just imagine. He's cool. I will miss hanging out with all of those guys at the arboretum. Oh, well. Maybe things will be cool at my new work/study job. Whenever it is that I find one, that is. I should probably get going. Maybe I can still return my Physics books. It's not too late, I don't think. The other things I have to do can wait until tomorrow. But not much later than that. Oh well, everything will be ok. 
__label__label0 whats so hard about college? I've been here 0 and half weeks already, and I don't find anything hard about this. I've skipped a coupla chem classes, and bio classes already. why do people say its hard. so confused. I'm weary that I will fail miserbly on my tests because I think I know everything. arrogance. I think I am arrogant in thinking that I know what the professors are teaching now. but I don't want to be arrogant. indecision. do I want to be a doctor? do I want to go the pre med route? what if I do this and don't even make it to med school? do I really think then I can make it to law school? but I hate law school. I hate writing. this is so stupid. I don't want to do this. I don't like expressing my mind to strangers. dang I wonder how much my comics are worth now. I wish the damn 00 minutes would go by a little quicker. I want to see how much my comics are worth. I wonder if I should start buying comics again. no. I'm not a kid anymore. but damn, I like comics. so many decisions. damn being responsible is hard. I went from living at home and carefree, to having to make every decision myself. I need to change. I'm not studious at all. I'm afraid that I'm going to fail miserbly , and not get anywhere close to a 0. 0 gpa. then I'll only have myself to blame if I don't get that 0. 0. then I wont get a car that I want. damn supra turbos are nice. but do I really need one here? I could use a car. indecision. but I really want one. but that means I need to get a 0. 0. and I need to study but I don't want to. I want to play ball, and shoot pool and hang out. I don't want to study. but damn I think I need to. I have no clue whats going in calc 0. I don't want to fail that damn class. crap I shoulda taken 000c. easy a for sure. regret. now this means I'll have to work and study. but I've never studied before. I don't know where to begin. but I want good grades. I want a 0. 0. I know I have to work. but I don't want to!I hate work. I hate it. I'm a lazy s. o. b. crap. crap. crap. so much responsibility. I hate it. I wish I was a kid again. back in high school at least. it was much better then. course I was always hoping for better things, like a better car, better grades, better anything. I hate growing up. but I have to. realization. super catharisis. moment to reflect. I have to be a man now. I am responsible for my future now. its only me. tru I may have friends, my girlfriend, my family behind me. but its me. my future depends on how I accept responsibility. if I want to get a 0. 0 gpa. I'll have to study. if I don't want to be afraid to fail calc 0. I have to study and learn all the calc things. if I don't want to sleep in class. I have to go to sleep earlier. I cannot fade to temptation, I must resist. I must be mature. responsible. because its only me now. but I'm scared. I don't think I can handle it. I don't want to be responsible for everything. but I want so much. gawd. 0. 0 for a year to get any car I want. thats going to be hard. but I've never achieved such a goal. I've never had to put myself to anything. this is it. this college. I must. fear. indecision. temptation. irresponsibility. I must forgo all and just do what is right. its time to apply myself. its up to me now. crap. 
__label__label0 Well, I suppose one of the first things that enter into my mind are why in the world did I wait this long to get assignments like this done. I always put a lot of unneccesary pressure on myself by putting these things off. I haven't been doing in college so far, but I know if I was more productive with my time I'd be better off. That and money. I haven't been very good with money lately. Oh, I have plenty to live on, but I spend a LOT of money on things I simply don't need. I also tend to spend money unwisely, like buying things somewhere when I KNOW I can get them somewhere else much cheaper, but I buy it anyways because it's there and convenient. I don't have any income right now eithher, I need a work-study job, but that shouldn't be too hard. I've already paid my rent for the semester, and so a job should cover my phone bill and other little living expenses just fine. I've got some more money coming in for doing webpages for other people, too. The unfortunate thing is, it's getting to a point where it's almost a home-run business, and I'm beginning to worry about whethter or not taxes become an issue. I hate filling out forms, much less loads of tax forms. I'm only 00, and it's a thing I do on the side to make extra money, and I don't know if I should be concerned with such a thing as business tax forms and accounting. I've only done three small commerical webpages . . I don't know if that excuses me from anything. I need to talk to some expert about that. Money is no object to me, in the end, though. That's probably why I'm so careless about most of it. I have been keeping a pretty tight track of it, though, just to make sure I don't go broke. I'm looking at buying a computer, and I think I have just enough. My work study job then could easily cover my little living expenses. I also spend a good bit on music, which is something I'm really into. Not music in general, mind you, but just the stuff I listen too. A lot of it is fairly obscure . . I'm not even talking about rock obscure or grunge obscure or world music obscure. I listen to a good bit of forgotten artist's stuff, like albums they release after they've had their heydey - which is usually in the 00s. I listen to music basically all the time. My roommate has actually been pretty cool about me playing the music all the time, sometimes I wonder if he minds, but I don't think he does. We have a guitar in our room, and it's my roommate's. He doesn't play it too often, only a bit now and then. He's decent. I don't know anything, though. I'm not muscially inclined, personally, in any way. I don't sing or play any insturments, though I wish I did. Something like keyboards or drums would be cool, but I've been learning to apprecaite the guitar more. I like to hear guitarists who make them sing and make distinct sounds than the heavy clunky stuff most grunge-rock-alternative bands make. PROPNAME PROPNAME, when he was a guitarist for Genesis way back when, is a great example. I heard somewhere that he would try to make the guitar sound more synthesized, and as a result, he played some interesting solos. He made the band sound a little more Floyd-ish I guess. Still, that's the kind of guitar I'd like to learn to play. Acoustic riffs would be neat to learn, too. The keyboards would be tough, but I'd think the most fun to play could be the drums. Drummers have a lot of different styles, I've noticed. I wouldn't leanr to play really fast and make a lot of noise, I would want to learn how to play perfectly timed melodic noises - stuff that doesn't take just speed, but lots of skill, too. I don't know how most bands play it now a days, but drums don't always particularly stand out in some songs now a days, but I guess a lot of them don't hold that as important. When PROPNAME PROPNAME was drummer for Genesis, the drums had moments in the songs when they really stood out. Not because they were loud, neccessarily, but because they were different with what you usually heard. They didn't go along with the song, they would almost LEAD the song. Really, though, all of the members of the band Genesis make it such a great band, which if you haven't caught on by now, is my favorite band. I'm getting a little tired and I have lot more reading and some homework to do. Tomorrow is Monday and classes start up again. Fun. 
__label__label1 this tyoe of thing bothers me because it seems really impossible to typ eexamap wow that was swpelled bad I mean t exactly what I am thinking . mab thisis really hard for me because I kkep wanteing to go back andn fix allt he crap errors I am making, I never realized how bad I was at typing ok that is better I guess I just need to get in the wrythim or nto to get the typing thing right. well I don't knw I have done this before in my spare time but somthinges was that suppoes to say somethings because I think I meant somethines  man that is weird I can't type it I somethings no I want to type sometimes ok then,  this mamkes no sense myabe my mindis just ompletely twisted and illogical. I doub t it though because it sut nevermind that word I  often think abou t things so logivally that it scares me. proving yourself wrong is knida werid because you almost regret it sometimnes. an interseting thought that keeps coming to me, I will have to ask the prof this: if one is beign tried for  a murder, and to get "away" withit he pretends to be insane, and the trial lasts like a real long time like a year or two, and this whole time he has to pretend he is really off the wall completely insane, would he after a while actually in reality become insane, but because he is really insane not realize it and still insist he is completely sane in his own mind, I somehow htinki  that he could really go insane and not realize it, I guess itsa ll perception thought, I mean who perceives what, I perceive mysefl to be sane, but maybe on another standard I am insane, who is to say what is really right?  Well I think ultimately there is a standerad or fgith and wrong it is just ath people who are wrong can't really be proved that they are wrong because we deal with perception. like basicaly I belve in GOd, and what he says andhis standards are absolute truths, but since those of us who believe it are human, we can only relay it as our perception see, and those who have a different perception may be wrong, but cannot be prved wrong because each argument is a perception. basically that is what faith is there for, some fcould argue that faith is actually a device made up by the human mind to justify a perception, but then you could argue that this arguement is actually a perception devised to justify a different percepton. I really didnt find blari witch scary, I mean, it really was a little freaky, but not hjold my breath to stop from screaming scary. whats wrierd is I have started thinking outside whati am typing and I keep thinking how I am faliing at truly represeintinng my thoghts. can yoiu belvie I am actually tryin to think of a creatvie way to end this?  How do yo end sterama of conciousness anyway??????????? in reality you can't can you, I just have to force my hands of the keyboard. 
__label__label1 Hmm. let's see. what to write about. since we're on the topic of psychology, I was in awe when I first walked into the auditorium the first day of class. there were more people in that room than in my entire graduting class last year. it was a pretty impressive sight, but also a bit omnious. so far I like my classes, but all of them are bigger than my highschool classes, but then again what am I supposed to expect with a school population of near 00,000 people as opposed to my 0000 high school population. man, I like this internet homework. this way you don't have to worry about keeping up with papers and the like. I used to loose most of my homework back in the day because I'm not that organized of a person. speaking of internet, you got to love this internet hookup in the dorm rooms. I like the fact that I can be in the internet and still have the phone line free. my parents used to hate when I'd tie up the phone line checking my e-mail. since all my friends went to different colleges, it's amazing how handy e-mail really is. I've already talked to a few of them using some aol instant messanger. it's kind of funny really, to see how many of your old high school friends keep in touch over the school year, or keep in touch at all for that matter. I've been in contact with some of my good friends, but also been surprised at not hearing from 0 or 0 close ones. I think I decided that I'm going back for our high school's homecoming on sept 00. supposedly a lot of my friends are going to, and I'd really like to see them. I'm also going back this next weekend (labor day weekend)  seems that I forgot to pack a lot of stuff, or didn't even thing of stuff, that I ended up needing in college. I guess in a way it's kind of hard to pack for moving away, because you don't know exactly what you'll need until you get there. it must seem to you by now that I'm relating a lot of stuff back to high school. well don't go over analyzing it or anything, it's just what I'm basing a lot of my college experiences on so far. it's funny, I never had to read or study back in high school. it just sort of came to me naturally through teacher lectures. but here I'm actually having to adjust and take notes, read the book, etc. having to pull a 000 is weird, but I think I'm doing a good job so far. man, I hope my laundry's not done yet. I still have a few more minutes go to writing, but I just hate it when people put their stuff in the dryer or washer and leave, only to come back an hour later when there's a huge line forming to use it. heh, I guess I should start practicing what I preech, but I figure I've got tons of time to start doing that. most likely I'll start when I get out of schoo, get married, and have kids so I don't set a bad example. yeah, I eventually want to have kids, and I stress eventually. I've got so many good one liners that I've inherited from my parent's, along with a few that I thought up all on my own, that I can't wait to try out on my youngins. hmm, I seem to have a bit of a problem. I forgot when I started typing my mindless babbling. I think I still have a few minutes left. this assignment reminds me of a book I had to read last year in english. well, I didn't have to because I didn't, but we were supposed to. it was. a portrait of an artist as a young man. I remember it because the author used a lot of stream of conciousness in the book, which made it harder to follow and understand, thus less appetising to me to read. I did however, download the cliffs notes off the internet and read those, so I guess I didn't totally slack off. I just. took a shortcut. ok, I think my sentence is served, so I'm going to go check on my laundry. 
__label__label0 I keep thinking about the future and how my life will alter during and after college. I wonder how my grades will be after the first term. I hope I can make my parents proud. I don't want my parents to view me as a failure and a screw up I want them to be proud. I want to be accepted by everyone I meet. I want to succed in life. I wonder how my math test will be tomorrow. I just wish that society didn't view people on how much money they make I wish I could go to a place where everyone was the same and there was nothing to worry about maybe the place I'm thinking about is eternal utopia or heaven. I wonder if there is a heaven what happens after death where do we go. do we ever see the "creator" what is the creator is it god or did we evolve through evolution of mico o                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
__label__label0 At this exact moment I am wondering how long this twenty minutes is going to last because I am going to falll asleep  soon and I  have a lot of things to do. I wish I could be doing this on my own computer, but the stupid thing wont work, I  think I am computer illiterate. I have had e-mail sitting  there since june and I can't get into it. It is killing me that I'm not able  to talk with all of my friends that went away for college. I shouldn't have waited to do this assignment until now because I need  to finish getting my stuff together to go back to ny dorm room. I am really glad that I was able to get away from her for a day, I always have the worst luck and got an incompatible roommate, but I would rather not have come home. The food is better but my  parents are constantly bothering me. I need to check my messages in my room,I bet there are going to be at least ten, and half of them are going to be from PROPNAME, my ex-boyfriend. Not going to waste my time on him anymore-- why do people cheat on each other, I woant  ever understand that. And what makes him think that just by sayng I Love You htat I am just going to forget everything. Forget hijm,  at  least I have met someone new that I can tlak to heis so sweet and all but I think I should call it off, nothing ever works for me  and I ned to concentrate more on my shcool work. I don't know what to do about guys. I need to meet some more girls to hang out  with, but the only ones I see are all snoby sorority girls  a nd that just isn't me at all. PROPNAME is such a sweet guy and all but should  I tell him htat I need to slow down and work on my shcool or should I just let things go and see what happens. I'm scared to just go with  the flow, I really like this guy a lot and the last time I felt this way I got hurt and  that pain is still here. PROPNAME PROPNAME calls I  get a happy feeling inside until I think of kyle and how he is here now and how PROPNAME messed up when he screwed me over. My mom is yelling at me again I wonder what I did now. Icould be nothing but it will still be my fault for some reason  I swear that if I ever heard my  parents compliment me or say that they were proud of my I would probably have a heart attack right then and there. I wish I wasnt such  a dissapointment  I have never done anything right and if I don't get a 0. 0 gpa they are going to lay it on me because if my sister can do it,  and play volley-ball at ut then I should be able to just sit there and study constently and maybe one day live up to her. My feelings for  PROPNAME and Kyle are so mumble-jumbled in my brain right now that it is starting to hurt from thinking about it all the time. Well what a  surprise my mom is coming to yell at me  as much as I am used to it the tears still come very easily. 
__label__label1 I feel stressed,tired and kind of anxcious like I have so much to do and not enough time to do it in. I am wondering what I really want to do in life and if I will be successful in life. I wonder how I will do in school and if I will make it through four years of school. I am thinking of my boyfriend, he goes to prarie view a&m and I miss him a lot. I wonder what he is up tp right now and I want to talk to him because I miss him. I am thinking how sleepy I am and how much I want to go to sleep. I am trying to work and think of all the other things I still need to. I miss my other friends and I am wondering if they are having as much stress as I am. I really want to go to bed but every night that I go to bed I feel like I have a lot to do that I have not yet finished. I have a lot going through my mind and it confuses me because sometimes I think I don't now what I really want out of life. I get very afraid that I will not succeed in life. I want to make my parents proud and happy but I also want to be happy myself but I am not totally sure what I really want out of life. I always thinl about how I don't want to be a dissapointment. I don't want to fail but I don't know if I am strong enough to succeed. 
__label__label1 This is a little confusing. I am not quite sure what I ahould be doing. Oh well I guess it really doesn't matter. I am glad I am going home this weekend. I really miss everyone. It will cool to just hang out at home and not have to worry about what I should be doing right now. College is a lot of reading. I am actually learning a lot more than I learned in a whole semester of high school. I enjoy that but it does get to be a bit tedious, expecially science. Well iguess it can only get better form here on. I was confused about a lot of stuff, like what to do with all of my spare time. I was going to have a job but then they took away my work study and now I have too much free time. That's okay because I didn't really want to work anyway. But I can't believe the lady never called be back. Tha t is just rude etiquette. Oh well. There's nothing I can do about it anyway. I wonder why we are shunned by our dorm mates. I guess we weren't social enough or something. We tried. But at least they aren't outright mean to us, they are just very cordial and you know what that means. Doh!  Oh well. It's fun rooming with PROPNAME, I just don't know why she chooses to bother me on purpose sometimes. I think she can be very immature at times. But I would rather put up with that than with someone who barely talks or just doesn't like me for whatever reason. I don't want to go to all those meetings tonight that sucks!  Maybe I just won't go. But I probably will. I can't shirk my responsibilites just because I don't want to. Maybe some people need to do that once in a while though. I wonder what PROPNAME would have to say about that. His books are cool. I like the idea of PROPNAME just sitting around waiting to confuse people. If you make people question their own values, then what do you consider as your values?  I don't know. LThat's just odd. 
__label__label1 I wonder if they sell show posters at that let's see, I have 0:00, I have until about 0:00 to write, no that's not right, yes, wait, yeah it is, anyway, I wish I could go back to new york I remember the LOCNAME LOCNAME I got to tell PROPNAME I ran into PROPNAME today and that she lives in LOCNAME, with the teletubby wrappingpaper on the door, I should tell PROPNAME too, I wonder how PROPNAME is and why hasn't she e-mailed me back, I wonder what PROPNAME's up to  right now. I got to get PROPNAME a birthday card and one for PROPNAME too. My Girl, aww that reminds me PROPNAME PROPNAME, I'm thirsty PROPNAME, I miss her I have so much work to do I want to take ballet really bad it makes me sad when I can't and I really wish I had my ponte shoes here aww daisy I wish she was here right now I wonder if she even misses me she doesn;t act like that, like she does when I get home, she could at least wag her tail or twitch an ear like Mama says awww hee hee oh I needa call LOCNAME and PROPNAME today and tell them hi I really want to see that album of pictures PROPNAME said uncle had and PROPNAME said PROPNAME goes hee hee I could be writing an e-mail for this long and not even notice it like when I write one for like I should tell Ms. PROPNAME about the press job, she'd be proud I still need to get my Savrola from churchill I wonder if they can mail it if I call and does she still work there?  I think so I think she does I wonder if she'd write back, I could just send it to churchill I hope suzanne at least found out something about josh even though veronica doesn't say much, I wish I had some degas posters to put on my wall but I wouldn't put them up there probably, I would probably just frame them cause I wouldn't want to ruin them like my dawson's creek poster, those copy max people I knew it'! I knew that'd be the poster they'd mess up with the laminating that reminds me I wonder what kind I don't remember exactly what kind of system they used in creative writing to do train of thought for a prompt that's write, I mean right! hee hee :OP  kathryn and emily, oh I have to write to her, or e-mail, that's quicker, anyway, it was some kind  of system where you type random letters or something I wonder how josh is doing I really hope suzanne found something out but I doubt she did becuase that's wierd how you can learn to type and eventually not even look ath the keys like gl said, awww I can't wait till 00nd street I wonder if gl and annette and daniel will come  back to do it and ay! those people are so loud!  quit screaming, it's like they've never been on their own before or something no control anyways maybe I'll see if anneliese can go with me to pick out a card for PROPNAME and one for robert and there was this one at LOCNAME and Noble that I wanted to get for christine, a pink cadillac, she 'll definitely like that, hee hee I can't wait till opening night that will be fun I wonder if she will be home tomorrow or tonight I hope so because I haven't written and I called the other day, but I hope she got the message, I wonder if josh got sarah's message or if he even got the card I hope so I want to watch my movies too but I have so much to catch up on. it's so cold in here I can't believe there's still like ten minutes to go, anyway, I can't wait till the a jet all the way why are you so nice to them if they annoy you so much why I can;t believe that lady sang somewhere   that's so wierd like david and mr. walker and suzanne's connected in some wierd circle to all of that it's wierd like it there really fate or, people would just say I'm relating all this stuff together because it's on my mind but things pop out at PROPNAME without her even asking, that's kind of  I wonder how long everyone else's is is it I guess it just depends how long you type snoopy awww I'm glad I brought those with me so they can sit in my dorm instead and my picture of daist mae I got to go to church this weekend too I can't wait till dc starts did I already say that, my arm' s starting to hurt Mama says it's too high like the ones at home it said don't worry about punctuation and stuff right, cause it's like train of thought I better go check at the end I wonder how many people actually type 00 min straight without stopping I'm trying anyway I guess I deserve a break but I don't want to have all this math hw in the week either I 'm so glad it's only a semester I miss PROPNAME I can't wait till she comes here it's wierd how all these twin subjects keep popping up I wonder if I should reread this cause time's almost up I can't wait to go card shopping it's fun I wonder if sara flores is back in town yet what was I saying oh I doubt people check over this I should prolly write to ms. hester sometime I was think ing about calling her but I don't know when she'd be there or have lessons or if I wonder how big little josh is now, not josh, but andrea's dog awww prolly pretty big by now I need to respond to ms martin's letter too but it sounded like she didn't expect me to respond for a while even though I prolly will and get sidetract I wonder what jessica's up to I have to get I'm working why don't they just say the problem instead of giving a number sarah thought that was funny when I said the computer talked I wonder if she ate with the cats today ha ha I should call her!  hee he :OP well time's up I guess I wonder if I should look over this prolly most people don't but  sarah says why do you check stuff so muchjust cause well time's up I guess I can stop writing now,   
__label__label1 OK, it's 0:00 and I hope I can get through this assignment without my computer crashing. I hate typing. chris is an asshole; this was a very bad day and I know it's probably bad to always be negative, but I don't fucking care because this is my stream and no one else's and I don't think anyone will read this anyway and if you do, you'll never know who I am because there are ten million people in that fucking class and no one knows who I am. by they way, would it be fucking possible to go to one of those classes and not be surrounded by sorority bitches? I mean, they are so annoying with their chatter about boys and hair and beer and parties, and they talk in class which is really annoying and they make my skin crawl. well I stopped for like 00 seconds, is that OK? are you going to come over here and kill me now? didn't think so. damn, I am displaying some fucked-up-ness am I not? I knew this was going to be a 000 intro class but I forgot that meant freshmen crawling around everywhere. I was never that stupid. I was never that annoying. well fuck, it's only 0:00; but anyway I have a ton of homework to do today and a friend is coming over  for dessert later, so I need to get this done. i will add some happy thoughts just so you don't apply your analytical theories and conclude that I am mad and need to be injected with some medicines to make me happier and more docile. happy. happy. happy. nothing comes to mind. except that donny's trial is finally over and that makes me happy. my brother, donny, was accused be a couple of girls of molestation during a clarinet lesson and that was nine months ago and my family had to pay thousands of dollars to defend the lucky guy and now we have no money, but at least those mini-whores backed down, yeah thanks, after 0 damn months they were like (my hand hurts) nevermind, we don't want to testify (because we're lieing!!!!) how do you spelll lieing? liing, lying yeah lying, sorry that I don't know how to spell but who cares becasue no one is going to read this anyway. I am a very fast typist so I think that my writing will be longer than most chris just walked by sophie the kitty is playing with the lizards and chris is trying to look at the screen but I think he shouldn't his is my fiance and my fhands hurt carpal tunnel carpal tunnel I have a huge secret: I have a giant crush on an old english teacher of mine; she is a woman; and I an engaged to marry a man. hahahahah. that's funny. I think that htat is very very funnyll meow. I made a cat toy for sophie; a film canaster full of pennies; she loves it; it is loud and my toes are cold; I had hot dogs for dinner; I can't tyep as fast a s my thought are coming; becasue I am thing like a milltion things at a time like tath I sjust spent 000 dollars on a princeton review and I hope that I t gives me a better ORGNAME score than ANYONE in the ENTIRE WORLD!! hahahahahha I don't care what you say; I am taking a break. ok now I am mutch better. muthc I said mutch; hahah I am better my hands don't' just I meant hurt anymore but my toes are still cold. anyway this english teacher is really cool and I've had her for like two semesters and she said I was "too naughty" in class. what is chris blowing on? he was blowing on "a tabby thing on his  book and he wanted the ink to dry. last night he farted and it smelled really bad. ihahahah the things going through my mind. I hiop chris says he wants to read this and that iwll probayy color my thoughts for the duration; could you do something aobut those fukcing standardized tests? I means really? I got a 0000 on my SAT and I hapve a 0. 00 ORGNAME; os that was not a very good predictor of my progress at 0:00 see  you. 
__label__label1 I've been thinking a lot about this next weekend. Tryint to plan everything out so I get to see everyone. I miss home. The people, the places. My church, my room, and all the little things too. Just the familiar surroundings that make home what it is. So peaceful. So safe. One things I've found at college is that there's a void in my life that can't be filled. It won't ever be tha same. The relationships with people back home, that's the biggest void of them all. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Ms. PROPNAME, my parents. You can't replace that. It's always there, just sitting, empty. Sure, I can meet new people, do new things, but you can never replace a person, a relationship. They're all differnt and unique. My left arm is tired. Well, I just thought that so I figured I'd write it. And I just thought about writing about my arm. Wow!  And I JUST thought about thinking about writing about my arm. It never ends. weird. I've always been interested in how the human minds works. It's funny when you think about it. Here we are, using our minds, trying to figure out how our own minds work!  Isn't that weird?  When you think about it, where do you get yourself?  How can you come to a conclusion when the conclusion you're trying to come to, is actually the tool you're trying to come to that conclusion with?  It's impossible. An endless cirlce of thought and ideas. The human mind is a mystery, and always will be. That kind of impresses me that I came with that. Gee, I'm smart. Just kidding. Well. ten more minutes. Ok, I ;ve gone from missing home to pondering about the human mind. My shoulder hurts. Wow, I complain a lot. I'm feeling my elbow right now. It's swollen or something. I'm not sure why. I've been working out a lot so that might have something to do with it. Who knows?  It doesn't hurt, but I don't know if I should avoid straining it or what. I'm supposed to work out today. We'll see. I've been thinking about someone back home a lot. Her name is PROPNAME and we met about a month before I left for college. There was this kind of initial attraction I guess you'd say. Kind of weird. I haven't had anything like that in a couple of years. I think it was her bright personality. She has thing kind of glow about her. She's always laughing. I like that in people, because I need to laugh more sometime. So we kind of talked about our relationship some, and I told her I didn't think it was best if we committed to anything, I mean, since I was leaving for college. She's a junior in high school. But we've kept in touch a lot. I think she wants a committment, but I don't think that's smart. But you know, there are sometimes when what is smart isn't what is right. Sometimes we have to do the irrational and just dive in without holding back. It's like faith. God doesn't always make sense to me. I hear all the time people trying to disprove God, or Christ, or the Bible, or christianity. like I'm taking this class, the Rise of Christianity, and he always tries to show flaws in the Bible or myths about the early churches, or whatever. But the fact is this:  I know what PROPNAME has done in my life, and nothing can change that. EVER!  What He did WAS illogical, it WAS beyond understanding, it WAS a miracle!  And NOTHING can disprove that, not science, not anything. How do people react to that then?  Well, people's final defense is usually, "Well, then you must be crazy. "  And if that's all they have, then I'll take that any day. Times up. Hey, I liked this assignment. I think I will enjoy this class. 
__label__label1 I have never had to write like this for a class before, but I believe that I have done something similar to this on paper -- like in a journal or something. I'm not sure what I am going to write about for twenty minutes, but I guess it will not be that hard. there's a really cool song on channel 00 right now -- I heard it while I was doing my hoomework last night. it's like a live version of a song by LOCNAME. I think I'll go out and get the CD. when I have the money -- haha. this is a really cool group. I think I can get into their music. I'm  a real music lover. I think there's always a song of some sort playing in my head. I can't wait to hear a lot of the live music downtown. hopefully we (my roomates and I) will go soon. music and art are really my thing, even though right now my major is biology. I'll probably end up giving in and doing what I want to do. I just don't know how I'll make it (financially). but enough about that. lets see. gosh, PROPNAME PROPNAME is SO gorgeous. I really want to go back out there this weekend. it's so relaxing. I love being up here in austin. see, I'm from corpus christi - which is also a very pretty city - but it's just so FLAT down there. the land and everything. all we have is mesquite trees and cactus. the beach is great, but I grew up in a more rural part of south texas about 00 minutes or so from the beach. I can't imagine moving back to south texas though, not now that I've seen hills and trees. and no humidity!  my hair does great here. my parents should retire around here. might be good for thier alergies. I don't think I will live in austin forever, but as far as texas goes, I think it's the only place I might live. I want to travel though. see all the places I've never seen. maybe I'll study abroad. who knows. gosh, my parents would die. see, I'm the only child. I've already had to come home like 0 times since I moved here in august. I miss them too though. a lot. I guess maybe I'm not supposed to go off on a tangent like that. i'm just suppossed to write about what thoughts come to mind. but I guess those were what came to mind. hmmm. i'm tired. yes, I hope I'm able to get more sleep tonight than I did last night. maybe I'll get motivated and get all my work done before. oh. 0 o'clock?  probably not. but I'll get to sleep in friday and this weekend. I had better get motivated today. yeah, I guess after this I will begin studying and then go out for a jog. I always feel better after I excercise. and excercise is something I really need right now. there's just not enough hours in the day, you know?  I'm taking 00 hours and 0 of the five courses involve a lot of reading. the other two involve a lot of ananlytical thinking -- something I don't enjoy a whole lot. well, not at all, actually. ok, times up. twenty minutes. wow -- that went by more quickly than I thought it would. and check out my HUGE run-on paragraph!  I hate those. oh well. 
__label__label0 As I sit here and complete this assignment, I am reminded of all the other homework assignments I have been bombarded with this Labor Day weekend. Much of it is reading, and I know how important it is to keep up with it. I have learned many lessons from procrastinating. I keep thinking how this weekend is flying by too quickly. I am currently enjoying my short stay here back at home. I feel as if that in the blink of an eye, I will be back at college. When I returned home on Friday, I went to my brother's high school football game. Just being in that atmosphere brought back all the feelings of high school. Some were good and some bad, but I will always treasure the memories of going to those games and having the time of my life with my friends. My birthday is next Monday on the thirteenth, and it will definitely not be the same without all of my close high school friends. I cannot believe my birthday this year has to be on the worst day of the week. I will probably celebrate it with my family next weekend. My feet are freezing right now. I need to put some warm slippers on. Since I am writing this assignment on paper first, my hand is beginning to cramp up. However, I am beginning to think of how much I am truly enjoying this assignment. I like the way I can just freely express myself without any impediments to cease me. I feel a bit hungry because I have not eaten breakfast yet, and it is nearly lunch time. I have a familiar craving for fruit. My mom has read my mind and has just brought a bowl of grapes over to me. The taste of cold, plump, luscious grapes satisfies my momentary craving. I need to go running today because I did not eat very healthy yesterday, and I feel fat. I wonder if it has been twenty minutes yet. I think so. I better stop before I babble on forever and ever about the most randomest things. 
__label__label1 I should have done this assingment sooner. It is a different type of assignment from ones I usually get. It is hard to write out what I am thinking about. I can't seem to put my thoughts into words, or maybe I can but I just don't want to tell anyone about somethings that I think about, especially someone I don't really know. I think that is the reason I put off this assignment for so long. I didn't know if I wanted to just pour out all of my thoughts into this assignment. I don't know if I thought I would be ambarrassed with my thoughts or if I just wanted to keep them secret. Not that any of them would be embarrassing. I think that I mostly  just didn't want to have to write them down. It doesn't seem that writing down your thoughts would be very difficult, but once you actually sit down and try to track your thoughts your mind goes blank, or you try to think of something interesting to think about. I was thinking about going to work tonight and wondering if I would actually get off at nine. I also thought about an internet friend from LOCNAME who I haven't talked to in a while. But I didn't think those were too interesting to write about so I began to think about other things. It is amazing how you can think about so many different things sometimes and at others times you can't think of anything. Just the other day, I was trying to write a philosophy paper and I thought I would be able to write it very easily. But when I actually sat down and began to put my thoughts into words on the paper it came to be extremely difficult. I knew what I wanted to say but it was hard for me to elaborate my thoughts to fill two pages for the assignment. I became frustrated and disappointed with myself brecause I couldn't expand my thoughts. I believe that I could have written a beautiful paper but at the times I sat down to work on it my brain seemed to go blank and I couldn't think of the right words to use or how to make my sentences make sense. I htink that I have this problem often, but usually I can overcome my "writer's block" simply by putting the assignment away for a while and trying to write again later. I think that is another reason I put this assignment off for so long. I made it seem harder than it really is and made myself have "writer's block. "  I seemed to not be thinking about anything so I couldn't just put my thoughts down. I was also worried about writing about the right things, but I realized it doesn't mater what I write about, it is just supposed to be what I am thinking. These twenty minutes have actually gone by pretty fast and I feel good about myself for just getting this assignment done and not procrastinating any more. I have definetly learned to do these assignments right away and that I don't have to think too much about them. I just need to write and not worry about how "stupid" I think they sound. 
__label__label1 thinking about how school is so different, so many people, so many things to do, all the perpetual motion. music is great, is it really what I want ot do?

__label__label0 Mostly I'm reeling in amazement at how complicated looking a Vitamin B-00 molecule is. That goofy larry wall and his themed state of the onion adresses. heh. Doh. keep writing. I suppose turning off the TV and ignoring IRC for a while would be a good idea. Twenty minutes eh. that's a long time. I suppose I ought to mark the start time. 00:00 will do nicely. Dootdedoo. Wellk look at that, jam's brain goes blank, remembers the TV, backtracks to PROPNAME's debut in World Championship Wrestling and thinks how pathetic it was. PROPNAME PROPNAME is such an idiot. Oooh. I'll fight buff bagwell. moron. PROPNAME is a face. HE'll kick your (bleep) into the next country.

My use of (bleep) led to that rather long parenthetical outbusrt, which in turn made me think of his mighty authorliness Mr. PROPNAME, which in turn caused me to spontaneously recall several large words and what I did for an hour or three today. I do find it slightly amusing that in 0 out of my 0 classes today, a laptop and a puter-screen projector appeared. It's such a pity they all had crappy operating systems on them. Although the ORGNAME one was the worst. Windows. How sickening. I can't stand that feited piece of monkey (bleep). How the unholy hell can anyone consider paying for something so unbelieveably substandard?

You know, I hope I'm doing this properly. No I don't. I don't care. It's simply do-and-get-credit. PROPNAME. lex has a picture apparently. Oooh. no pleasure in what you do. pity you sound like an idiot. The stinger coming out. joy. I like his entrance music. It's nifty. Sorta ominus and stuff. I liked sting better when he wore a trenchcoat, carried a baseball bat and descended from the ceiling. Pity those columbine dicks had to go and ruin the trenchcoat thing, and then the late, great, owen hart's descent into a ring post stopped the rafters stuff. I keep forgetting sting gets a title shot later this month. Damnit lex, get to the bloody point. I don't want to hear this crap. Irrefutable proof. Pfft. Scam artist. that's a good one. Did you think that up yourself?GET TO THE POINT YOU NADEATER. Jesus. you are so annoyng. PROPNAME rammed PROPNAME with the hummer. what the hell. oh that's so conclusive.

Let's pop the fingers and otherwise kill some time waiting for something to come to mind. take a drink, piss o. er. no. Why did DDP just suckerpunch hogan. that's so queer. Damnit I hate it when they do that. What the hell just happened?  Is hogan evil?  Is lex joining DDP?  Is sting believing this (bleep)?  Will gris ruin heller?  Heh. I bet that last one stumped you.

Oooh. scantily clad females. there goes my id again. I bet I could get ted to help me with my psych homework. maybe he knows some good stuff to do that research paper on, because there is no way in LOCNAME that I'm going to do that bloody experimentation stuff. Not only can I not stand people, I can't stand speaking to them, or doing the stuff they tell me, so the entire theory of experimenting on me is . well it just doesn't work. I find the whole idea so repulsive that I'd wrather wriiteaotnseuhsatnoheusnaoheu. rather write a 0 page is it? research paper than do that. What a lazy (bleepard) I am. Oh look. time's getting close to up. if it didn't require my stopping I'd go make one of these clocks show me the seconds. pity, that. Wait wait wait. wait wait wait. heh. At the third tone the time will me 000000. beep beep BEEP. L. PROPNAME PROPNAME probably owns the copyright on Gris and all the other mission earth stuff, even if he is dead. And his worship himself DNA, PROPNAME PROPNAME definately, unless he's a complete moron, owns the trademark/copyright on the number 00. 
__label__label1 what am I thinking about don't got the foggest clue. looking to see how long I have to write for and what I am going to write about. thinking about a wonderful girl that I wish to be close to just wondering if she wants the smae or if I want to see other people. I do miss having my sister in the same city as me she really has meant a lot to me in the past few years and I do wish she was here. but then again I am loving all of my freedom here. have not talked to my mom in a few days and I like it she is not hounding me to do anything. niether is my grandmother. wonder why kellys dad wanted to talk to me. do miss kelly a little but hopefully we can still be friends  wonder what nicole is doing right now. this is the third time I tried to write but the other tow trys I go restless and stop writing. really did not know what to say but now I am just hoping it is not to late for these writing assignments. always seem to wait till the last minute. I cna hear thoughts in my mind but don't know how to put them into words. or which one should I write about first. lunch was good and now I am feeling better because I got something to eat. don't want to work anymmore at eddie bauer because I don't like it anymore and I don't want to work there because I may have something better to do and plus I hope I can find someone to work for me tomarrow so I can go to the training session to be an offical for intermural football. hope my family is doing ok have not heard from them lately. still have ten minutes to write. my mind is completly blank I keep thinking about this book we read last year in english it was written in stream of thought. hope the professer got my email about the brain test to see if a person is right or left brained. nose itches. relly wish we did not have to do this. or at least not for so long. ok sitting like this is not the easiet  ok that is better. morrre comfortable. hope miriam can go this weekend to george carlin have not talked to her in a week and hope everything is going good with her. my neighbors are wierd they play some stange fucked up music. hope I do good on my quiz tommarow I need to study and catch up on my readings. need to know when my calculus test is. and my eco. test. hope the pysc test is not soon. really need to catch up on some reading. hope nicold can everything taken care of so she is not so stressed out. I love spending time with her she is so wonderfull. I think I may love her but then again I still have a wondering eye. I want to meet nwe people and who know the right woman may be out ther but right now I think she is the one. ok good time is up. 
__label__label1 Well, I don't know, or should I say that I am not sure on much right now. I feel like I've always tried to be good and kind and honest, especially honest. Now, it's not like much of any of those, beause I am not right to PROPNAME. Oh PROPNAME, I don't know why I have done and do the things I do. Some people aren't right in your life. PROPNAME's right because he is comfortable. Others are old and dirty and uncaring. Yet, I am still spending all this time and energy on them. Not thinking much of myself, am I?  Do I? Will I ever? It's like I always have the right things all planned out--like PROPNAME tells me--but I never have the confidence to follow through with everything I dream or how I want or wish to be. I want to be strong and I don't want to be taken advantage of for the rest of my life. I want to be pretty and I want to be skinny like I was when I was fifteen with long brown hair. I can go back to that. I just have to run, run like I did and eat much less. I have a perfect vision of what I want to be but I always set myself up to fail. I won't follow through but I must. I must be honest with my feelings toward PROPNAME, not honest with what happenned, just with my feelings because I do care about him. I do. I don't want to hate myself right now. sometimes, someimes when I'm alone with my thoughts I think too much about all of it, I feel dirty, dirty and ashamed, and all I want is someone to hold me and tell me that they know and they still care and they still like me and they want to be there, that's what I thought PROPNAME was or is. critical though. He can be so critical, but he said he called--called like he nevercalls anyone he misses. He missed me enough to call me. more than I thought I would. we said more than we thought we would greg and nathaniel make me want to be a better person. I always want nathaniel to see me in the right way--he knows, greg too, they still care. But I am always like that questioning whether anyone does. maybe the thing will work and I will be happy- not eat more. iam afraid to eat more, but I probably won't if I do it right. But I want to get all nice looking for when I seee greg at Christmas. I want him to think I am pretty, he will, no more diritness-- it's ending soon, but I have to get the pictures back. I remember Saturday night. I couldn't even close my eyes or lay by myself. trouble sleeping. i had to go ly next to my mom . she cares she really does. I don't care what they say about her or think about her there's a love and care in her. she's really concerned about me. she wants me to get better. I'm trying. she doesn't know the dirty things--she has a nidea, but in it all she doesn't care she still loves me. I wish I could hug her. go back this weekend to houston like you always, do PROPNAME. try to be happy, think of others and fufill what you want of yourself be everything you want plus some-- now that's pretty. 
__label__label1 I don't like the fact that I'm not sure if I can print stuff in this library. it would be so much more easy if I had my own computer, but oh well sarah is probably getting one in a few days then I can use hers it is so crazy how much things have become computer dependent I never thought that I would have a class that was web-based. but it seems that most of mine are and its kinda good in a way because it is forcing me to actually use the technology thats out there I'm not very computer oriented but I think about one year of college will whip me into shape, speaking of I need to go to the gym, but I'm not sure that ill make it tonight maybe ill call jane and see if she has time to go wiht me. sarah doesn't really work out a lot so I've been doing it by myself it would be a good idea to get one of thoes little hand held recorders and tape my spanish lectures because he lectures entirely in spanish and I understand spanish stuff so much better the second time through that I think it would be a really good idea to tape him and then listen to it while I work out wow its only been five minutes its hard to do stuff like this when you know that tons of homework awaits you and you arent really looking forward to it. I'm so glad we have monday off ORGNAME doesn't' even have this holiday but I guess that they started later than we did. I'm going there this weekend and I can't wait to see my closest friends in all the world because they all went there I'm glad I didnt even though I miss them dearly because I have been forced to meet all kinds of new people and I have met some really nice ones, not as great as my best freinds but then again its only been two weeks they all seem to be sticking together pretty much which I think I s pretty dumb because they are never going to grow up if they don't start spreading there wings so to speak. its kinda funny that I just happened to look at my watch and I have been writing for ten minutes now I always seem to look at it in 0-00-00 minute increments. maybe myu internal clock is really acurate or something. I dunno. I'm really tired right now even though I got a lot of sleep the other night maybe I just need even more. I need more sleep thatn anyone I know I wonder if I get more tired because I convince myself I didnt get enough sleep or if I'm actually really tired. I think I do get really tired becuase it starts to show on my face, I get horrible bags under my eyes and I just look gross. like right now. plus I am totally broken out, more than I have ever been, but I'm hoping that its just the stress from going off to colegio. who knows well see in about a week. why is it that sometimes your face turns red. I hate that so much I feel so exposed when that happens. I can feel it getting hotter and I think that makes me even more self concious which in turn makes mya face even more red. I wonder if people you don't know notice when you blush or is it not as obvious as it seems. i didnt used to blush but now I occasionally do a t really inopportune times . like today when a guy I think is attractive said hi to me I got all flustered. its so stupid I don't even know him and I've convinced myself that we are destined to be together. sometimes I am so unrealistic when it comes to relationships correction I am always unrealistic that is something hard for me to admit to because in admitting that I feel let down. I get really dejected when it comes to guys, and I don't theink that any good ones exist even though I know in theory that isn't true I just havent come accross anyone who has disproved it to me. maybe its because I don't attract the nice guys because I'm sending off a negative vibe that was on oprah the other day. they were saying how can you attract someone if you automatically have a bad attitude about it and think that they couldnt possibly be worhty of you. I dunno. I can't stop thinking all guys are bad just to attract a guy because I think that is the wrong motive for changing my opinion. its like in bridget jones diary she does stuff like that sometimes I remind myself of her except not as extreme. well of course not she was a complete lunatic. I wish my parents were not in ireland right now becasue I would looooovvvveeee to see them this weekend but I can wait I miss them so much I think because we get along so incredibly well its really abnormal I think no one else I know gets along as well with there parents as I do its really cool I thinkwow I went over the 00 minutes who would have guessed thats kinda weird everytime I mentioned the time I said wow. huh 
__label__label0 I am really tired and bored right now. I am a really bad typist. I am so unhappy with myself, the way I look sometimes. I hate my body. I am in love with this guy and he says that I am beautiful, and goodlooking, but I don't believe him. I need to hear compliments though. Sometimes I wake up and I look at myself, and I like what I see, then I go outside, and I see all the other girls, how thin and tan they are, and I suddenly hate my body again. This boy doesn't even know that I am in love with him, and I haven't seen him in a few months, because he went to summer school here while I stayed at home and worked. every time I see him I fall for him all over again. But with distance, I slowly get over him, and think about him less. But he is always in the back of my mind. I feel so comfortable with him, like I can say or do anything and it doesn't matter. I think that he is perfect in that I recognize and accept his faults, and only want him to become more secure with himself. I think that he is a beautiful person. There are things I don't like, but I love him as a whole person, for who he is. And I hope I will see him again soon. I have thought about him since we said goodbye last May. I tried to get in touch, but it didn't work. And now he has a girlfriend and I think it is too late for us. It will always be the wrong time. But I can't stop loving him. Has it been twenty minutes yet, I don't think so. Oh well. I want to find someone that I can feel a friendship for that I could learn to love that would love me in return for who I am. That is why I love this Boy so much. We are such good friends, and he knows so much about me. He is a liar. I'm a liar. we are perfect for each other. Except that know he is in love with someone else, and has been with her. I want to be friends with her, but looking at her, I just don't like her, there is just something wrong with her. hopefully they will break up and he will realize he has no future with her. she is still in high school! wont graduate for two more years! she is a little girl. I think that time must be almost up now. Goodbye. 
__label__label1 Alright, well right now I have no idea what to write. I don't know what my professor is expecting this to say and I do not know what all of the other students are writing about. I don't really want to get too personal just in case I get to be the lucky one who's homework is spotchecked. I am worrying that school is not being focused on as much as it should be. I sometimes think that I am going to be able to get by as easily as I did in high school when at the same time I know that that is not the case at all. I know that I am going to have to study so much more than I ever have and it freaks me out. Especially since I am not so sure that I know exactly how to study. I don't want to go into an exam thinking that I know all the information and then have no clue what the test is saying to me. I want to do so well this semester and in a way I have to if I want to transfer into the school of communications next semester. And the fact that I heard the other day that Professor PROPNAME is the hardest psychology teacher here did not help much. I didn't think he seemed that hard but apparently he is. And I also am freaking out about the whole sorority thing. I am having so much fun with it but it is taking up a lot of my time and so are all of the parties that go with it. I have to decide whether or not I want to go home on Saturday for the night. I want to see my parents and my friends but I don't know if it is worth it. And also I don't want to get really sad when I am there. I am worried that I am not going to really want to come back. That is not saying that I am not having such a fun time here but I think that me not wanting to come back after a night at home is a possibility. I am having so much fun here but it is a lot of stuff to deal with sometimes. And it is like I am never capable of being alone. And when I am alone, its when I don't really want to be alone. There are always things going on and people around when I just want to relax and sit down. But that is never possible. And there is so much to do all the time that studying is so hard to fit into my schedule. But I do have to admit that I am studying because I know I am more than some of my friends. Friends is another thing that kind of scares me. I hope that my best friends from home and I don't lose touch just because there are so many new faces here and everyone is wanting to meet new people. I just kind of wish that I knew who my group of friends is going to be so that I can start hanging out with them and making memories that are going to count. Okay, well I hope that this is what you expected from my 00 minutes of writing because I had no idea what else to write. Now maybe you can look at the way my brain works and help me deal with my problems. 
__label__label1 Here I am in college. It's pretty weird and scary all at the same time. PROPNAME is in LOCNAME, he says that he is in love with me now that he is away from me. I on the other hand have pulled away. He was so controlling and bad to me in high school that it is hard for me to turn away now that he is so nice and perfect. I love him very much, but I've met another guy who is so perfect in everyway. He is so nice and understanding, some much more than I've ever experienced. Mom is coming today. Yesterday was my birthday so she is coming today to take me to eat and bring me some presents. I am so tired, I was up until 0 this morning, she is going to think I'm sick. I don't know how I made it to my morning classes. On Fridays I am done by 00 am! That is so nice. I kind of miss my friends back home. It's hard to having friends that don't understand you completely yet. I love texas! 
__label__label1 My feet are killing me. Why am I doing this. My feet sting, I think I'm going to put something on them. Those sandals are horrible. I'm never wearing those again. We have to walk all the way back to class in 00 minutes. This song on my computer kicks ass. I can't wait to go to Elements tonight and pick up some tail. That would be nice. I miss her though. But I wonder if she feels the same way about things right now. I have no idea. I always think about this. I don't know what to do. I love her. I want to go clubbing. I want to get really drunk tonight. I can't cheat on her, but is she saying the same thing. We love each other, I know it. I need to get my mind off of that situation right now. I got to start studying more. She studies all the time. Fuck I did it again. Shift your thoughts to something else. Do it. Okay I need to study when we get back from Psychology class. I got to read Chapter 0 in Economics, and read some Art History. After that I need to call PROPNAME, then get ready and go get drunk. I need to wake up early tomorrow to get a job. God I'm so lazy. I can't believe I slept until one today. This writing what's on my mind stuff is pretty weird, its starting to get kind of boring. I wonder if he's even going to read what's on my mind. Well, it doesn't really matter this paper is pretty stupid. I would get kind off scared if I had to read 000 of these papers. I think I'm going to quit writing this assignment now just cause I don't feel like doing it, and I want to test how long it will take for someone to read this. When whoever who's reading this gets to this point, count how many days it has been since September 00,0000. I would like to know how long it has been so please email me at solomon00@mail. utexas. edu. If you would like I got five more minutes to get back to what I'm thinking right now. Right now I'm thinking that I want to get a drink of water, have a snuff, walk to class, sit next to some hot girl, get her number, and take her out tonight. Wow, I think I just answered my question that I was thinking at the beginning of the page, or did I? I'm tired of writing this, it's just making my girlfriend problem worse. I quit. 
__label__label0 My mind is fried from the test that I just took. Did I do well? Did I screw up?. Did I get tickets to the football game. PROPNAME was supposed to have a friend draw. I hope our seats are good, because today has been a rough day. I hope PROPNAME likes me. This writing assignment makes me feel really funny because of all my sporadic thoughts. I wonder if this is one of the papers you decide to read, or if it is just going to end up in some data bank somewhere. I hope psychology is going to be a semi easy course because college at this point is a little overwhelming. My roommate just walked in, so I guess I should mention her. PROPNAME or Ally, whatever I feel like calling her at the time. She fun, makes me laugh, I could use that right now. The test was easy but what if I just screwed up on it because it was my first test. I guess I will know by today what the event will be. The pressure to make good grades is getting to me. I want to have fun and do a little bit of everything, but I don't know how to fit it all in. I want to party with my friends, but I also want to do well. How far will that get me in life. What if I bust my butt and nothing happens. I'm beginning to notice a pattern in my thoughts; they are all questions. Does that mean I'm missing the answers, or does that mean I worry too much. Here I go with the questioning again. I'm trying not to be clichéd and do the average, I wonder if so and so likes me, but it is ending up like that. All of my life is in a state of not knowing. For everything that I have learned, it seems like there is much more because everything that I know doesn't answer all of my questions. That's where I get my nosiness, I guess. I classify myself as an ambulance chaser. The time is flying a lot faster than I thought. PROPNAME PROPNAME is on tv, that is PROPNAME's favorite show. She's at home in LOCNAME. I miss her so much and that reminds me that PROPNAME's surgery is going to be tomorrow. He's so little, will he be ok. More questions. They are driving me nuts (feel sorry for the reader). Here's the issue of time again. I'm running out of it, literally and figuratively. I guess its nap time, I don't even know if I want to do that for sure. 
__label__label1 0. 00 checking in don't know where to start. I do this a lot though kind of relieves stress like candles and music and flowers haha really girly, huh? oh well, I guess that's me more like a girl on the inside. outside is just comfortable. god, my hair is annoying. it's hot as hell, too thick curly hair doesn't go well with the texas heat I'm writing and all I'm thinking is that if you really do read this, how exactly am I being judged man, this could be an essay about me and my identity and how I interpret myself but that wouldn't let you decide for yourself. and I'm way into that. I want to decide. it can be good, bad, whatever haha it's funny when it's a bad decision, but always an experience my LOCNAME far east competition in volleyball bad time to get caught volleyball captain, a lot of responsibilities damn, I miss volleyball but I don't know if I could survive it definitely something fun to do, but no. rotc takes way too much time hahaha only 00 hours. I remember LOCNAME shoot I didn't even know what it was to sleep unless I was riding in a bus getting somewhere awww away trips those rocked memories. friends. love. trust. heartache. god, I miss LOCNAME. I can't believe I talked to PROPNAME and marry I miss them a lot this college thing is really cool, but dang, nothing compares to serious friendship. I miss my baby damn the fact that he's way younger. it doesn't' matter. I'm tired of everyone's "idea" of what is right for me. I loved him for that I can always be myself. whatever that is we'll see. I wonder if I'm going to "find myself" here haha this is the place for it, right? ~~bisexuality~~ I mean it's college and all I'm supposed to understand life and myself and who I am and what I'm like this seems more like an email I would send to phillip we were always like this like reading each other's diary in an email. I wonder what he's up to there are a lot of people like that some that I wouldn't mind forgetting about but why? they all touched me in some way haha that sounds sexual I can't believe I admitted to mars before tat or seo or anyone I didn't think I could talk to her like that it takes a lot of guts on both sides for us to have what we have I love her for that I know she feels guilty. we'll see hopefully this will be a lifelong friendship I'm so lucky for that and I thank god for it not like most people: only talk to him when they need something it's funny how religion works it's only prominent in people's lives when they are in need of something then again, I guess that's how a lot of things work I am learning, though not the innocent, little, trusting girl I used to be or at least, not as much haha LOCNAME taught me that I owe my life to that place more the people than the actual place, I guess. more seo than anything I love him I should feel guilty I should actually be censoring my thoughts right about now but, I guess that wouldn't be the assignment. I love ben. I love seo and I would die if I didn't have both of them in my life selfish? I don't know isn't everybody in some way? I think as long as all the people involved accept and are comfortable and happy. happiness is so important. it's funny when people are happy. I don't have to be happy but I couldn't live with myself otherwise so many things play on happiness love. trust. comfort dang, I think I said that before this is something I would send to Mr. PROPNAME I hope his father is okay I would know how hard it would be for him if he wasn't damn. ORGNAME I hope you're watching over me and I know I do some pretty messed up things stuff you wouldn't expect from me but, it's the truth I guess that's a good thing knowing me for who I am maybe it's not all good ben would die if he knew the entire truth can I live with myself knowing I cheated him???? I don't know air force honor code "I will not lie, steal or cheat or tolerate among us anyone who does". do I absolutely have to live with that? isn't it, after all, my decision who will know, right? but, no. I couldn't do that the only thing is ben right now my only source of guilt then again, also my soul source of happiness and love and passion and pleasure I hope all that won't turn into regret and pain. god, after rod, I don't know if I can handle that I don't know I would become another American girl I am so not that or at least, I would argue that I'm not whatever. I don't even remember when I started I don't think I'm supposed to be thinking about that maybe this is all wrong. maybe I'm supposed to be doing this word association thing cloud. picnic. ben. love. good thing. sex. passion. seo. lifelong friend, lover, everything I want and need. kind of like my mom except not I don't know should it be words or sentences I think that I think in phrases it's actually harder writing one word at a time whatever. damn, I need a cigarette shit, but I promised 0 today I think I passed that a few hours ago damn smoker's alley. haha is that what it's called. hahaha I feel so unamerican. mars told me I would be hahaha. it's all good: the allAmerican blond ass PROPNAME feels isolated. I'm still okay. it's a good thing. I don't know for how long I'm scared shitless that I'm going to get cancer or something not because I'm going to die shoot, I could care less. I'm happy. I can dies happy. I will die happy. it's just because my mom would die I remember telling her. you know she cried I've never seen her cry only when it somehow deals with me. damn, she loves me god, that is the greatest thing of all knowing that your heart is in the teeth of your creation wow sounds like a JEWEL song I should listen to her very inspiring kind of like talking to people who are passionate about what they do. damn, I love that maybe that's why I'm big into guys who sing and write poetry it's funny, because ben doesn't do either one, and I am so in love with this guy. shit, I don't even want kids, and I would have them for him he knows that I hope it'll last. I figure this is the hardest part. me in college him still in hS I really don't want to deny him a high school social life he's sweet about it I don't know I don't want him to think in years from now "what if". you know??? god, I hope not. but I make him happy and he makes me happy and we complete each other hahaa same thing with seo god, this is weird. james doesn't think it'll last. a triangle with me as the main point I don't know shoot, I'm special enough, right? who says I can't have it all that sounds conceited. but I'm not. not if you really got to know me anyway confident? I don't know. more uncertain and scared. reminds me of my identity poem: TYPICAL ECCENTRICITY. whoa it's 0. 00 
__label__label0 Man I wish I could go home, I really miss PROPNAME I know he is right down stairs but I wish he would come over. I can't wait until my sister comes today, we will have so much fun, oh I need to do my homework for math, and I can't forget to go to that meeting at 0:00. That reminds me of what I have to find out about it the subject I want to do. I wish PROPNAME would wake up I can't believe she was out until 0:00 last night, that is really late, but I guess since she didn't have any classes it is not that big of a deal. I want to eat lunch, I'm really hungry, I need to pack to, I can't believe I have to pack to go down the street, that is so stupid, I need to call my mom and tell her to get nicci to bring that shoulder bag. For next weekend. I'm tired. I wish I were asleep like PROPNAME. I wonder what our homework for linguistics is? I guess I need to look. This is a really weird thing to do, I wonder if I am doing it right, and what they will find out about me. I wonder if I am crazy, I don't think so though. I miss my mommy! I wish I was going home instead of staying here, but I guess that is ok. PROPNAME is so stupid sometimes. I need to not forget my stuff in the dryer. I wish blaire and PROPNAME didn't fight all the time, I mean I love them both, but they are so annoying when they argue. Oh yeah, I need to figure out where ORGNAME's is so we don't get lost, I guess I can look on the Internet. I love Family Feud, and playing it online, but it is hard, cause I always am talking to people and when I am trying to play that stinks. I'm glad PROPNAME and PROPNAME are my friends, and I'm glad I'm in the fig, it was such a good idea. But I wish I didn't have to take English over again. I wish I could just be in the fig and have just Math and Psychology. I am so tired, I can't believe I had to get up for one class today, I should have just slept in, it is all cloudy and everything any way, why should I get up when it is so dreary outside. Math is so easy; I don't have to go there to understand it. I could just get the homework assignment and I wouldn't need to listen to her talk. Man this is really hard to think of things to write I feel like my mind isn't thinking. I wonder how much longer my stuff in the dryer has. I don't like having to write everything I think, oh yeah I need to call and see how many minutes my phone has on it, so I don't go over. That is a lot of money if I go over my time. I need to look up the phone number to find out how many I have. I wonder whom I call, the place I bought the phone or ORGNAME, I don't know. I am thinking about thinking, I can't think any more. This is so weird. I wonder what lee is doing. I wonder if I am disturbing PROPNAME's sleep, oh well she disturbs mine when I am trying to sleep all the time. Man, I really am hungry now; I wish my 00 minutes would hurry up and get over with. I guess I am thinking about doing something else besides this. I am tired of typing. 00 minutes feels like along time when you type continuously. I wish I could think about something else. I can think about sleep, it is good. My bed is too hard though. I need to talk to my mom about that mattress store. I wonder if what PROPNAME said was true? I mean that is crazy if that really happened. I need to go to the store. I need to order nicci's bday cake. Man I'm cold. That fan is really powerful. I wish lee would hurry up and pack so that we could go eat, I'm hungry, but I don't know what to eat, the cafeteria always stinks and the place down stairs is so stinking expensive. I wish that the deli thing would open it will be so good. I wonder what kind of bread they will have. My contacts are drying out from this fan, but luckily I don't have much time left to write. Thank goodness. I hate typing all my thoughts for so long the time seems forever away. I wonder if I am using to many dining dollars, I need to go look and see. I need to pay my thing too. My face itches. Ok it's better. I guess my time is almost up! YEAH! I'm hungry I think I'm almost finished. I need to hurry up and eat though, because I have to get my clothes out of the dryer, so no one steals them. Ok, I'm finished. I need to spell check it now. Bye 
__label__label1 I hate driving in LOCNAME. There is never any parking and there are scratches on cars everywhere. People are so impolite when it comes to cars. PROPNAME just kept running in to this car just because he didn't care about his own, someone hit my brand new car. And now I have no paint there, if my parents find out they are going kill me. My mom didn't want me to take it with me. I hope the body shop does a good job. That is my main concern. I had a headache this morning. I think from thinking too much and from drinking last night at the frat house. My roommate was being nice to me this morning. PROPNAME told me she talks about me and that we both know we annoy each other. my dad said we wouldn't get a long from the beginning. And boys are so much trouble. Why does PROPNAME always have to do this to me? I think I will finally answer his question truthfully now. I thought I had been, but he was right, I'm still hiding something. I don't understand what he means when he keeps asking me what I want. And then he says not to want anything. Why must he always try to be the good guy? I don't know if he is telling me the truth. If he says he could have fallen for me then why does he tell me not to want anything? This boy is driving me nuts. I don't understand why he keeps doing this. Deep down, I think I know the answer. But I guess I hide from things a lot. People always say I hide myself. PROPNAME says I hide myself in questions. I do. I never answer personal questions. I answer them with questions. I don't know why. Maybe I do need a psychiatrist. I think too much. I think I scare PROPNAME. Because he just got out of a long relationship and he fell in love with the girl and she broke his heart. I don't like her. She doesn't like me either. I've never spoken to her face to face but she does not exactly give you those warm fuzzy vibes. She looks at me funny. I think she's stringing him along. That's why he does this to me. But then he told me I was wrong. He said he doesn't want the past and that he can't. I think it scares him to let himself go. For some reason I think he's the person who can help me figure myself out. He saw through me hiding behind questions. But I think it's because I don't doubt him. I trust his opinions and his thoughts. That's something I don't do with most people. I trust him. Which surprised me. It usually takes me a long time to get close to someone. Maybe because I am always hiding. For some reason I think he has the key to unlock whatever it is I am hiding. And I think he knows exactly how to open what ever it is that I can't open myself. That's what I want, I guess. I want to tell him the truth but I can't. Because like him. I am hiding. We're both hiding. Only he does a better job at it. Probably because he is a guy. Why do I trust him? I don't understand that. But sometimes I think he says things just so he is not the bad guy. Why do I trust him so much? I think because sometimes he reminds me of myself. I remember when I first met him; I was not attracted to him. He looked cunning to me. Like he had the wits to take advantage of people because he was so smart. But then I think he also has the heart not to. That's why I think I started to like him. He has a good heart. And I think that's one quality that is hard to find. Oh my gosh! I guess this answers his question of what I think about him. I think I will give him a copy of this one day? I will tell him the truth. The entire truth of what I thought when I first met him until now. But I also want him to tell me too. Because I don't want to be the only one who opens up. But I don't think that will ever happen. I think my twenty minutes is about to be up. And I have such a bad memory; I don't remember anyone's name. I feel so bad. Why can't I remember? That's unfair to me because people know who I am but I have no idea who they are. I need to work on my memory. 
__label__label0 I don't really want to go to my BA000 class today. Sleep sounds so good right now. I don't think I have enough energy to sit through another hour and half class, since this morning I sat through three of them in a row. Oh yeah I better remember to call PROPNAME so we can go study at the ORGNAME or FAC. I don't know if I want to study with a whole group of people but maybe I'll give it a try. This is so cool. Getting graded on a writing assignment that is of our thoughts and feelings. Reminds me of my summer English 0000 class that I took where we had to write journals everyday and as long as we did them and turned them in it was ok. It is sooo freaking hot outside. And I am so tired, mainly because of the heat. Hmmm. I wonder if PROPNAME has called. I feel so bad for her. Anyways, that is kind of depressing just thinking about it. I feel so stressed out. These first three weeks at ORGNAME has been busy. Not with work and stuff but with things like getting everything together and making sure that I have insurance, my checking account is correct and other important things. I miss the home food so much! But I'll live, it's not too bad over here. I haven't seen any guys here. Hahah! Well I have but I don't think I will end up dating any right now. My hands are getting so tired right now. I really feel like sleeping. I think after BA000 I will go to eat at PROPNAME and then head to the library or something. These labs and libraries on campus are so good. They have everything and you can use them whenever. PROPNAME should be coming next Thursday to that Career Day thing so hopefully I'll see her. I am so confused on what to go into, like majors and stuff. I'm thinking about MIS but marketing sounds so good right now. Like I'm more interested in that kind of stuff and things that I really would enjoy doing. I know it doesn't have a lot of money or anything, but that is not what is important really to me. I mean yeah I want to earn a good living but that's not my main goal in life to be rich more like be happy. So I don't know. Just a confused freshman I guess!. Maybe I'll find out pretty soon. Man this time is going by so slowly. I've only been writing for ten minutes. Just realized how many thoughts flow through my mind in such small amount of time. Man I hope I get a chance to do a project because I do not want to write a paper. That sounds too boring. Being a part of an experiment sounds so cool, never really done that before. Ok I wish I had my headphones, too like the girl next to me. I need to listen to some music. I wonder if we are all going to go out this Thursday night to sixth street. I kind of want to. I feel so bad for PROPNAME, cause of her roommate. She is kind of mean, actually she is very rude and catches an attitude with every little thing. Even if she does not know you, she'll be so rude. Dang girl. Hahah. Ok well I need to find where my BA000 class is so I will be going now. So much for this writing assignment! I think my twenty minutes are up. Well actually they are almost up. But it said at least. Oh well I guess I'll go anyway. 
__label__label1 Well, hello Mr. Paper. I am so happy to be here writing about what is on my mind. Where should I start. "Start", isn't that a funny word. About as funny as the guy next door because he is singing to some girly song. Well, this might be pretty long because I type pretty fast. My eyes are so tired. Sometimes I think my mind purposely pushes my eyelids down, hinting at me that I need to keep them shut for more than a few hours. Sometimes when I take deep breathes it hurts. "Why?" you ask. Well it is a long story. It doesn't hurt, but it puts a sharp pain in my left shoulder due to my car accident ( I won't get into it). So, I am a college student now. What does that exactly mean? I think it means I can finally be myself. I don't have to worry about what my parents will think. There is only one restriction still holding my true self down. My girlfriend that I still have, even though she doesn't even go to school here. She lives all the way over in LOCNAME, and I can't stand the way things are. I say that I am in love with her, but is that true when I am so happy to be away from her? Anyways, I say "restriction" because that is what she is right now. I literally have to check in with her, and she has to know everything I do. So I guess in a way I didn't get away from my parents. She took their place. So, I figure that as long as she is in LOCNAME, and completely attached to me, I have to have my fun here and then lie to her. I know it sounds bad, but if I were to tell her what I actually do here, I would have to spend endless amounts of hours on the phone with her because she would be so upset. OK, I am sick of talking about this. The women at this University are the most amazing I have ever seen. And I guess that is why I am having such a hard time with my girlfriend. I have never seen so many good looking women. I feel like I am in a candy store. And it helps that I am a good looking guy, because I get their attention. That sounds conceited, but I am an honest man. I know that some women are attracted to me, and I am attracted to many women. Also, I am highly flirtatious, so my girlfriend gets real scared with me being here. I just tell here all the girls are ugly. I brought a camera to school. I have some incriminating photos on that thing. I need to get those developed and locked away. Nothing too bad, but bad enough to get me in trouble with my girlfriend. You see, why does everything come back to her. I hate it. I don't want to have to worry about a relationship right now! But what do I do? I respect and love her too much to hurt her. So, I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to do. Yet another thing I should be having to do. I just want to be here at college, go to class, study, meet people, have fun, and NOT worry about a relationship. Seriously, I have to get off this. Let's change the subject. I want to talk about cheese. Cheese is really weird. It comes from a cow, but how does it get to be cheese. I know there is an answer, but it is still a mystery in my mind. And then where do the holes come from? Are they bubbles of air, or did they just appear there, or did some kind of bug eat the cheese away? Swiss is my favorite. American is horrible. It just shouldn't be allowed. to be made. Cheddar is enjoyable. There are no other cheeses as far as I am concerned. They go great on hamburgers. With lettuce and mayo and ketchup, I can have myself a meal. Well, it is late and those little demons keep pushing my eye lids down, so I will end it here. It was wonderful to type on this lovely screen! 
__label__label1 0:00 twenty minutes to write what I am thinking Well, I am writing this at a time when I should be in class, but at least I am doing my homework. Between reading the book and doing the writing assignments, I think I have this class covered. I must admit I hate missing class because there are so many hotties in the class. When ever I get bored listening to the discussion that is merely a repetition of info in the book, I can stare around at the hundreds of fine chicks in the class. Don't get me wrong the class is interesting, but that's my thought. The guy that is sitting next to me smells bad. I know him, and has just said hello, The only reason I know him is because he is in many of my music classes, and his girlfriend is Hot. Holy shit, she just came in here to talk to him. This is really fucked up. I am trying to evesdrop as I write this. He is telling her what to do. oh wait they are noticing me, she left. Why does she date hIM? He's so nasty. I'm hungry, I ate not to long ago, maybe I want a cigarette. Busy busy busy, have a trombone lesson at five, still have to get my instrument from the instrument NAZI. He was on the sick out we all hate him. Some dude I don't know came up to the guy next to me and pretended to be him girlfriend by rubbing his shoulders, It was funny, I am really starting to get tired of this, but hey anything for a good grade. I am thinking to much abbot what to write. what to think. I am hungry, I wonder what happened in class today I'll just read the next chapter of the book, I like the book it is interesting. Lots of people in the lab today, feel kind of weird writing, can't wait tell Friday, actually every day is good when I am not in class and don't have anything to do. The dude next to me started talking to me, I hate him, I don't even know what he said. Hey 0:00 see you bye 
__label__label0 When I first thought about the stream of consciousness writing assignment, I figured my natural stream of consciousness would deliver my views on life and the issues that apply to the everyday. However, all I've been able to think about in the past twenty minutes is a girl. Her name is PROPNAME. We became close towards the end of the summer before I came back to LOCNAME. She lives in LOCNAME so its hard to get to see her very often. One date was all it took. I mean I've known the girl for years, but it became different after this one night. Kind of going from childhood friends to, I don't know, maybe something romantic. If I had known anything was there, I would've stomped on this opportunity a long time ago kind of like if I had known that there were 0 very essential vitamins in California Style Sunny Delight, I would've drunk that my whole life instead of orange juice. When did they come out with Sunny Delight anyways? I don't think it's been around for my entire life but probably pretty close. Possibly when I was five or six years old. At any rate, I always think to myself  could this girl be the one? She's beautiful to start with, and besides that, she's just amazing. I can't spend enough time with that girl. Just going to the playground and swinging with her makes me happy. I got a call from her the other day saying she was going to come see me next weekend. This could possibly be why I haven't been able to get her out of my mind. I really can't wait to see her. Possibly more excited than going to LOCNAME next summer. I'm just packing up my bags and heading down there to see if I can land a job at a local ski resort. I've always wanted to ski bum for a season, so I figured this would be a good chance. And being that the summer in our hemisphere is winter in their hemisphere, it works out  having all summer off. I was actually stressing about this all day being that it has to be in by 0 o clock. I'm leaving for College Station sometime today and I have got so much to do. A police officer gave me a speeding ticket two nights ago on LOCNAME. Now I have to take defensive driving and get my car inspected to get out of this ticket. And this, piled onto everything else that is going on. I'd say my stress level has recently risen to a 0! Nonetheless, I'm getting out of town this weekend and probably the next too. The swells are getting up to 0 feet on the LOCNAME gulf coast this weekend which is unheard of around here, so I want to get out and catch some waves before they recede. Surfing just makes me relax  puts me in a zone where there are no worries. Soccer doesn't do that for me. I played all my life and it was very fun but also came with a lot of pressure. There were many reasons I guess, but I just played to play, not to win a state championship or anything. Well I guess my twenty minutes are up, time to take a shower! 
__label__label0 I feel really good today because it is my birthday. I'm looking forward to being with my friends later on today. I'm thinking about tonight because my fraternity is having a match with the ZETAs. I'm pretty excited about it because they are the hottest girls I've seen so far. I kind of would like to go home though and see some of my friends back home. A lot of them are making trips back home this weekend to see some concert. I also would like to see my family on my birthday but I am sure I will see them soon. I don't really know what else I should write about except my birthday because it's all I have been thinking about this week. I plan to go pre party after I finish this writing assignment. So far I am loving it here in LOCNAME and am really glad I chose to come school up here. The size of my classes is quite a surprise and something I just have to get used to. I really enjoy having all the freedom here compared to back home in LOCNAME. I wish I had more time to just hang out but I stay really busy lately. Being a pledge in a fraternity really can be time consuming but it is worth it. I've met so many people these last three weeks and I'm sure it will be the same for the rest of the semester. Now I'm beginning to draw blank and can't think of much to write. Oh well, it's not like anyone will actually read this passage. I've got five minutes left on my time. I am so glad to be out of high school. College is much better though there is a lot of work to be done. My date better look good tonight in her eighties outfit for the party. The theme is an eighties prom but I just went got some clothes that look like their from the eighties. I can't wait to see what other people are going to be wearing. Well time is up. 
__label__label0 Oh. I don't even have a clue about the purpose of this assignment. Will Professor PROPNAME use this writing assignment as some kind of test? Interesting approach! Oh. wow. I have Psychology this Monday. I wonder what we're going to cover. I still have to read chapter two. Too much homework and so little time! I wonder when mom's going to get home. Is she going to the grocery store again? I have to ask PROPNAME about this. I really want some gum. I really wish that mom would get me some. Oh. this cricket is really annoying. Stop making that sound please! Is it already the cricket season again? Last year, I've seen about a hundred crickets, some dead and some alive, in front of ORGNAME. Now, we have crickets outside of my bedroom window. Great! Wow. PROPNAME has been watching the TV for a long time now. I'll give her fifteen more minutes and then I'm going to go turn off the TV. She should read more. Oh. I have to read my Biology too. I don't exactly want to read it. It's not going to be fun. I really want to go do something exciting so I can kind of clear my head up a little bit. I can probably ask dad to take me to the lake tomorrow. We can probably bring some food and have a picnic there. I really hope dad doesn't already have a plan. I have to ask dad, right away, when he gets home. Anyway, I have to start thinking about my schoolwork. I wonder how people can make perfect 0. 0 gpas. The must be really smart. I should study harder. I need to have better study skills. Oh. this Monday I need to go meet my Biology teacher. She's a really good teacher. I need to tell her that. This woman can really explain stuff. I should go look for the red folder and check for her office hours. I wish her office hour were somewhere from twelve o'clock to two o'clock. Ah. the crickets. the noise. this is really annoying. If this keeps on going, how am I supposed to sleep tonight? I really need lots of sleep. I'm really tired today. Wow. I can't believe I actually vacuumed the whole house today. I never thought I could have done this for just one morning. Amazing! I really want mom to get home soon. I wonder what we're going to have for dinner tonight. I really want chicken noodle soup. I also want some salads. Please get home soon. I'm hungry. Oh. thirty more seconds then I'm done with this writing assignment. If Professor PROPNAME read this he'll probably think that I don't have a stable mind. Ah. time's up. 
__label__label1 I have so much on my mind right now. It seems as if my world is changing in every way from every aspect. I have been told by someone close to me (my ex girlfriend) that I have changed. She will not tell me what she means or in what way I have changed. It bothers me more and more all the time. I can't see how I have changed. I have looked at every aspect of my life and personality and have yet to find any feeling different than that which I felt three months ago. I don't want her to be upset with me. I just wish she would tell me why. I feel like I am continuously trying to make everyone around me happy. I spend so much time being the listener of other people's problems. I just sit there and listen to them and when they want feedback I provide it to the best of my ability. The only problem is that sometimes I want to talk to someone. But people do not usually seem to have the same time for me. I usually find my own way of dealing with things such as bowling. Bowling is great stress relief. You challenge yourself only and get to throw heavy objects at other heavy objects to improve your score. I am not a violent person at all. but I do feel better after a few games of bowling. I enjoy talking to people about things and helping them with their problems. It just seems like there are a lot of problems out there for which I have no advice to give. It's as if I am letting them down. I am somewhat worried right now. Mainly about what will happen when I finish this thought process. I have to go to my fraternity house and help work on one of our pledge class's projects. I am tired and feel overwhelmed by what I have to do. I have schoolwork, friends, and fraternity. Any one of these could easily take all of my time. Yet here I am trying to budget all of it in. I realize that schoolwork comes first, but I do not want to give up my fun time. I enjoy fraternity but it is a lot of work and takes a lot of time. Right now if I had one wish it would be for me to never need sleep again. That would give me another 0 hours to get my daily tasks done. I guess maybe I should think of some good things too. Life can't be all bad. I have met so many new people since arriving at LOCNAME. I have made friends with people whom I can already tell have the potential to be lifelong friends. College has been like starting over. I have friends who also came to ORGNAME. But I rarely see them. And those who I did not get along with, I have yet to see thanks to the incredibly large campus. This is probably one of the most interesting assignments I have ever one. It has been a very long time since I simply sat down and wrote my feelings. In fact, this is the first time since I arrived at LOCNAME that I have had the opportunity to think about how I really feel. I actually feel better knowing where I stand on some of the most important aspects of my life. I will definitely make sure to read this again. maybe in a day or so. I might even do this assignment over again on my own in a week or so to see if and how my feelings have changed. I need new shoes. I stepped in a deep water puddle the other day and soaked them inside and out. It is time for a new pair of shoes anyway. I actually saw a student walking to class without shoes the other day. I can't imagine walking down the streets of campus without shoes. Why am I thinking about shoes? What time is it? Only one minute left. I have really enjoyed this assignment. I hope the upcoming writing assignments are as interesting as this one has been. Time is up. 
__label__label1 My life is an out of control freight train. I know not where I am going or how I am going to get there. Throw a match upon me and I could combust or possibly extinguish the flame, which you so eagerly tried to ignite. But for what reason do you do this? I hold the answer to so little, so it is to you that I pass the question. Why am I all of the sudden asking myself why? I know where I came from but does this mean I cannot know where I am going? On I travel into the world unknown, uncontrolled by arms of mythic proportions. This gyroscope of time has hurled many an uncertain soul into its path with unrelenting mercy. This is why I am grateful that I do not have to face the world alone. My life is full of love and hope. My hopes of myself are to touch some person the way I have been inspired by many a magnificent soul. This ring of stupidity, which we call life, is taking place in a common fashion and I can see through your blurry sight. And I can see through you! Your rules mean nothing to me and mine. I live a life of loyalty, true to myself and my own. I draw so much upon my music that I sometimes misinterpret fiction for fact. My life is one long song, sung by the most gifted beings. 
__label__label1 I wonder if I can make it to the SZB building in 00 minutes. Also, do I need to look at the map again? Probably so. I can't remember what room it is in. I think I'll have time for a nap this afternoon. It is definitely much needed; I just hope I can squeeze it in. It's a good thing I only have one class today. I hope the TA doesn't ask as many questions as he did last week. I think all of our brains are a bit numb. Wow. It's only been 0 minutes. This is going to be a long paper. I'm pleased that my parents are being more considerate of the apartment situation. They have to stop procrastinating and realize that this is the best thing to do in this situation. The cost of living in LOCNAME is absurd and so is the demand for living. Gosh. I just moved into ORGNAME and I already have to look for next year. I just hope I don't flunk out or else there goes half of the money! Maybe PROPNAME's dad talked to her and settled whatever worries she and my dad had. If he was worried about me handling the details with the realtor, he could have talked to him, but he refused. Ugh, like life couldn't be more difficult. Who needs their parents telling them what to do once they have gotten to college. It's my time now and they need to respect that. It's just too hard, I guess. All they ask about is school, grades, sometimes health, and sleep. They have to realize college isn't easy in any aspect, including the financial one. Oh, well, I guess they'll learn. I'm wondering when my dad is going to decide to send my computer here. Oops, that's right. I shouldn't expect it anytime soon since he procrastinates on everything. I feel so bad for having to use PROPNAME's computer all the time. I wonder what's for lunch today. I bet it's good. It's always good. I love SRD food and the waiters. I'm so happy to be living with PROPNAME and PROPNAME next year. I don't know PROPNAME too well, though. She seems nice, but I'm just saying that to be nice. I guess she's ok. She isn't the sort of person I would typically hang around with. She's also a neat freak and doesn't like cats. That's two hits against her. The funny thing is, the rest of us are messy, so I don't know who is going to share the room with her. I'm also very excited about the hamster. It will be so much fun to have a little apartment pet. I wonder what we'll name it. I hope my sister learns a lot at the convention this weekend. We all know she needs all the leadership skills she can handle! I wonder if PROPNAME is coming straight home from school. If so, she should be here pretty soon. I am so excited about PROPNAME's birthday present. I hope everything works out and PROPNAME and I can go to LOCNAME and use her RF something equipment. I love being creative and doing fun, meaningful things like that! Oh, my gosh, the 00's prom tonight is going to be so much fun! It'll be awesome to see everyone dressed up. That's a hard theme for guys to follow, though. I wouldn't know what to do if I was one of them. I hope PROPNAME turns out to be cute. I heard he's really sweet. People usually say that if someone isn't that good looking. Oh, well, if I survived a night with PROPNAME, I can definitely survive an 00's prom with PROPNAME. I wonder which ORGNAME knows me. Or, like PROPNAME said, he could've just been saying that. Either way it was very nice. I wonder what possessed PROPNAME to set me up with this guy. I've never been on a blind date before and the suspense is wonderful. I hope all this nasty drainage stuff is just allergies. I think it is. Everyone's allergies seem to be killing them right now. Ha. That was so funny that we saw PROPNAME PROPNAME at PROPNAME in the Box last night. It's deja vu. Wow that was neat how those little things popped up over the deja vu words. Wow, it did it again. I hope it is warm enough to go floating down the river this weekend. My mom said a cool front was supposed to move in. I hope not. Can't it wait another day? It'll be fun camping in tents. I've never really roughed it before. I better take my umbrella to school with me. It looks like it is about to rain. Oh, I also need to catch up on emails this afternoon. So much to do, so little time. PROPNAME, my time is up. 
__label__label0 I came back to my home town for Labor Day. I didn't really want to, but my friend talked me into coming with her. I've only been gone a week and I'm already back. Why? I'm not home sick. I guess I just didn't want to stay in LOCNAME when everyone I knew was leaving. I hope PROPNAME made it to the airport. I'm really worried about him right now. I pray for his mom to get better but I just don't know. I want to promise him everything is going to be alright but I just can't. I wish he would stop drinking to make the pain go away but I guess if it makes him feel better right now. Who am I to tell him what to do anyway? I wonder what time PROPNAME's game is tomorrow. My mom told me but I forgot. Maybe I should have gone to LOCNAME this weekend. I don't know? I think anything's better that being in LOCNAME. Football is such a big thing here. Of course the first thing we do is go to PROPNAME's football game as soon as we got here. I'm glad PROPNAME doesn't do anything as dangerous as that I already worry about him enough. I really think we are maturing in our relationship, learning to work through problems that most couples don't ever have in their entire lives. I don't know what he's going to do if he loses her too. I know she wants to be with his dad but isn't it selfish to leave your children. Catherine just came in here to ask me what time I was going to get up. I said 00 but that wasn't early enough so we decided on 0:00. I am very happy with my schedule because I don't have a class before 0:00 and I like all of them. One thing about school I hate is that I'm always so tired. Why can't I check my stupid email from my house? You would think a major computer system at a major university would have some way you could check it without having to download this and that. You should be able to enter your IF or UTEID and open a link site, but no. Nothing is that easy. I hate computers and if I never had to use one I wouldn't mind a bit, but if I didn't know how I couldn't pass any of my classes. That is another thing. Why is everything I need for a class on the internet? I feel sorry for people who have no clue how to use it. I thought PROPNAME was never going to hook up her computer but she finally discovered she had no choice. Computers are our lives these days. What would the human race do without them? It's scary you know, our whole life is on this thing and if they know what their doing, anyone could find some thing you don't want them to have. 
__label__label0 I hope that I am doing this assignment correctly. I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester. I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I don't want to wake up early tomorrow. Maybe I won't be tired. I probably will. I wish PROPNAME would hurry up and call me. I get tired of waiting. I need to do homework for math, but I don't really know how. I also don't want to go to Spanish tomorrow. I want my mom to buy me a new cell phone. I'm very glad this week is almost over. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll be very busy, but I'll have a lot of fun. I really hope that the guy I called today about buying his puppy doesn't sell it before I can have enough money to buy it. I'm so full. I shouldn't have eaten so much dinner. I hope my friend PROPNAME isn't mad at me for not calling her back for two weeks. I really don't want to go to school anymore. I wish I was married to a professional athlete or something. I'm very tired today even though I got plenty of sleep last night. My mom is so nice, but she gets so annoying sometimes. I feel really bad for being rude to her sometimes, but she treats me like I am in junior high sometimes. Probably because I'm the baby and she misses all her kids. I wish she would get a job or something so that she'd have something to do since my dad's never there for her. Maybe PROPNAME is home and he's calling me but he can't get hold of me because I am on the computer. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than you'd think. I don't think I have ever typed for twenty minutes straight before. The computer even thinks so. Now I'm going to have to resign online for the tenth time. Very annoying. I really just want to crawl into my bed right now. I would much rather sleep than do my homework but I guess I had better do my homework so I don't ruin my ORGNAME. Even though I'm sure it won't be as high this semester as last year. Oh well, it's not really my fault. I really don't think all that much in my head I don't believe because I am running out of things to type. I wish that I was in the Caymans with all of my friends right now. That would be so much fun. Maybe over Christmas or something. I think that not everyone could afford it though. I am so glad that I am still on my parents' payroll. I would be nowhere without it. I can't believe some people have to pay for their tuition and things like that. I couldn't imagine, but then again most of them are married or have babies or both. I definitely could not imagine that either. I wish I could stay this age or younger forever. Preferably a freshman in college. I really didn't realize how much fun I was having until I had to grow up a year. I hope that I am doing this assignment correctly. I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester.

__label__label0 I really don't know what to say. I am just doing some assignment for the Psychology class. It is an interesting class, yes, and I am happy to be in it. I am now looking at my pencil. This pencil has been with me for about a year and I still have not lost it. I usually loose these pens and pencils within 0 or 0 weeks. My roommate just picked up the phone and started talking to a friend of mine. It seems that LOCNAME just won the football game. I am happy to hear that. Again I am thinking what am I going to write for this assignment. Yes, I can type pretty fast but to write for 00 minutes, I really don't know what I will be saying?! I am a junior by hours at ORGNAME but I am actually a sophomore in electrical engineering. I work as a grader for EE000 class and I really like doing the job. Only thing is, I hate failing students but what can I do? If I don't, they will fail the other chapters to come. My roommate is laughing right now and distracting my thoughts from this assignment! Oh, well! I hope my friend who is studying in the library does not call me right now while I am doing this work. My friend and I are supposed to go and eat at PROPNAME soon. I really hope he does not interrupt me. I am feeling hungry now and I am getting tired for typing for a long time even though only about 00 minutes have passed. I wish the food was better for me to eat at the cafeteria. Unfortunately, the food is not great. My friend just called me but I am continuing writing. I told him to call me back in 00 minutes. Hopefully, I will be finished with this assignment. I can hear the conversation between my roommate and one of my friends over the phone. They are talking about going to 0th street. I probably would like to go but I think I need to call my brother and sister today. Anyway, that is life and I need to do all this work. I am really tired and now, my thoughts just don't flow anymore. I hear the bathroom toilet flush in the community bathroom. The room is suddenly cold and I wish I wasn't wearing shorts. Oh well. now what. I wish work was just bla bla bla and a whole lot of rubbish. However, it is not that easy. I want to get this assignment done with. Why wasn't it 00 minutes instead of 00 minutes? I wonder what the results of this experiment are going to be? What are they going to help with? I am really hungry and the only thing that is stopping me is this work. Please finish, please finish. a door just slammed because someone closed it hard. I wonder why. anyway, I am tired now. I don't want to write a research report for Psychology but I also don't want the experimentation in psychology to take a lot of time for me. I think I will stick with the experiments. I love being a grader in EE000. People look up to me but I have to remember to be humble to them because they are also human beings who are just as intelligent as me and they are all good people. I wish I could see my parents, my brother and sister right now. Unfortunately, I can't since I am an international student. I wonder how my friends from high school are doing. I hope they are doing well. Oh well, I have to go. Is it time, yet? Let me check. phone rings. PROPNAME called my roommate. a cool guy. I have to do something right now. it seems both my roommate and PROPNAME went to the same party yesterday and had good fun. Come on finish up. yes it is done. Thank you. my hands are really tired. Bye and thank you 
__label__label1 Ever since I came to the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME I have been thinking about playing soccer. I turned down a few soccer scholarships to come here. I wanted to come here because I know the business school is one of the greatest in the nation. After going to the football game I could picture myself playing soccer in front of all 00,000 people. I can picture myself right now dribbling 0 players and scoring a magnificent goal. Every one around me would be cheering like crazy and I would be the big man on campus. Right now, I am wondering if I have made the right decision whether or not I should have come here. Not only did I do very well in soccer, but I also got very good grades in high school. So, I made the decision to go with my mental power instead of playing soccer. As of now I am glad with the decision I have made. I am having a blast over here. Especially your class. It is the best. My class consists of about 000 people. That is a huge number. That was the size of my high school class in LOCNAME LOCNAME. In my Psychology class right now I have been sitting next to this very pretty girl whom I like. I am thinking about her right now and how it would feel if I kissed her. I am also thinking about my mom and dad at home. I know they must be very lonely. I just hope that their health remains in very good condition. I already told them that they have to live to be at least 00 years old. In high school towards the end I started to slack off. I told my parents that I would get very good grades so I have to study a lot this year. I am hoping that your tests will not be very hard. My sister is going to ORGNAME ORGNAME and is majoring in psychology. If I ever need help or anything I can always call her. She is a junior right now. Ever since I got here, I have been missing my cat very much. I have a picture of him next to my bed so I can see him every now and then. I can't wait to go home for the weekend. THANKS! 
__label__label0 Coming to this first year in a totally different new atmosphere for school, I knew there were many challenges. I think of the freedom of the lifestyle I'll be in as well as the work that I have to put into in getting the grades like how I did in high school. Wow, what a difference in lifestyle. I can come back to my dorm and go back to sleep after one class instead of having to go through a whole day like in high school and then finally going home and sleeping. But, its not like I don't sleep during class anyways. The ethernet connection here as had me in awe. After many years using my mediocre 00. 0 modem, the ethernet connection has been a blast. This is the first time I actually had to do an assignment online and send it online. so that's quite a change as well. I'll find that I might do less writing now, now that there are computers to do the writing for us. Living in the a dorm and around your peers usually lets u see any internal problems closeup when it happens. I've seen this already. It's not like everyday school life when you go home and ponder about the issue and go back to school the next day to see it again, or have to go on the phone and talk about it. Here, you meet the issues face to face usually, depending on where your peers live. You and your peers will get used to how each other lives, the way they eat, sleep, or drink. I'll see how I will get through this year  
__label__label1 As I begin to write this essay, I am thinking of what my mind is doing in preparation for writing. I began going through ideas that have come to me earlier this day, trying to find one that I might be able to write about for 00 minutes. I can hear the TV on in the background. It's Monday Night Football, so my mind continues to convince my eyes to look over to my left and look at the teams that are playing. However, I know that I need to write this essay, so I have made a pact with myself not to look over until I'm done. I am occasionally checking my watch to see how long I have been writing. I started at 0:00pm, so I will be done at 0:00. PROPNAME PROPNAME's voice is somewhat distracting since he doesn't sound like the normal, professional voice of a sports announcer, and I laugh at his jokes only because they are not that funny. Now I'm trying to think of something else, only because I know this essay was meant to show what my mind thinks of on it's own, and not my personal opinion of the football game on TV. I temporarily blanked out, and there was nothing I could think of to write, so I stopped and stretched my hands and neck. Even though I am concentrating on the computer screen in front of me, my ears have nothing better to do than listen to the ads. I don't think it's a good thing that I am able to tell there was a car ad on just because of the music playing in the background. However, I suppose that is why advertisers pick certain kinds of music. They're hoping that it will stick in the minds of the viewers and they'll buy that certain product. I do not know the specific car that was just advertised based on the music, but I am sure that it was some sort of truck that was being advertised as a tough, strong vehicle. The idea of advertising reminds me that I want to go into the college of communications. I know I am a creative and artistic person, so I want a career that will utilize my abilities and something that I can personally enjoy. I would love to be involved with an advertising team coming up with ideas for companies, or a sports photographer. In high school, I was the Photography Editor for the school newspaper. I took many photos for the sports section, and I truly enjoyed standing on the sidelines at the football games and taking pictures. By being so close to the players, I got to understand their true size and feel the emotions going on during the game. Now that I've seen what that's like, I know that when one watches a game from the stands, they are missing out on some of the action and emotion. However, after going to the UT game this past weekend, I realized that the crowd has its own vibe that is also fun to be a part of. As that streak of thought came to an end, I glanced down at my watch and noticed the time was merely 00 seconds away from 0:00, so by now my time is done. 
__label__label0 So, I am supposed to write about what thoughts are going through my head now, all right. I am wondering about this class, I have only heard good things about it except for the fact that it is hard to get an 'A' in it. I really hope that I can because I am trying to make a 0. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. I feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and I stay home and read well last night I just goofed off most of the night because I couldn't concentrate. Since I don't know what to expect on our first college tests I am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. I had a lot of fun at the Delt Pledge party this weekend though, I was a time that I went out and it was worth it. I just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 0 minutes faster than my computer; I will need to fix that in a minute because I know the computer is right. It felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn't too hot. The football game is going to be horribly hot but I can't wait! I really need to get back into typing. I mean that I have been making a lot of typos I hope that I am catching them. I am listening to PROPNAME and PROPNAME I love them, one of my best friends, PROPNAME and I used to always sing to "Cecilia". PROPNAME goes to Tech; I haven't talked to her in a while. I need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but I am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. It will be better tomorrow because I only have 0 classes tomorrow and 0 on Friday. Monday I have 0 classes, that is going to be killer! It's been nice since we haven't had a Monday class yet, though. I went to aerobics today and didn't get a very hard work out so I tried to go to PROPNAME but I forgot that it isn't opened until after 00:00 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. I went to the CoOp to return 0 books but the worker told me that I needed to bring another receipt so I'll have to back tomorrow. I have been trying to stay on campus on days that I have classes with breaks that are 0¸ hours or less between classes. That makes me read and eat lunch outside and so I don't waste time walking home and back to class. It is a good plan but by the end of the day I am very tired. I like this writing assignment. It make me aware of what I think about randomly I guess that is the point of the project. I want to see the movie "Bring it On" it's a cheerleader movie. I heard it was corny but that I would like it I cheered in high school and so I guess it's a given that I would enjoy anything of this sort. I can't wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game I love football too. It's weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn't been a bigger deal to me. It sort of feels like I am at camp. I like it here. Oh, it's been 00 minutes! Bye 
__label__label1 My week is catching up with me so my mind is somewhat numb from all of the information being presented to me. The fun and freedom that as a freshman are all too new to me are affecting my energy level and I am fighting the urge to sleep right now. Although my body is so tired my desire to have fun and go out outweigh the lack of energy. As an extrovert my energy seems to come from other people no matter how tired I think I am. I love the newness of everything and hope that it lingers as long as possible. Sometimes, though I long for the familiarity I have left behind. I almost avoid my photo album of my friends, boyfriend, and family. I miss the love which comes so naturally from them. Its that level which takes so long to reach. Everyone here I know at a shallow level. I constantly wonder who will be my best friends at the end of this year. Who will be the ones I will reach that next level of friendship with? There are so many uncertainties about the future. With my boyfriend and I dating other people, I wonder if the miles between us are going to be a stronger force than our love. Was backing off on the seriousness of our relationship a bad idea? I am having fun but he isn't and I really don't want to lose him. It was his choice, though, to go to the ORGNAME ORGNAME instead of coming to ORGNAME so it's his own fault he doesn't like it. My heart just aches for him though because I hate the thought that he isn't happy. I think that is what love is. It's when you hurt just as much as when the person you care about is hurting. It's when you'd do anything in your power to take away that hurt, putting there feelings in front of your own. Love is so much more complex than that, but I believe this at least part of it. I think that when you know everything about a person, when all of their deep dark secrets are told, and you still are head over heels for the person, that is love. Someone once told me we like because, we love although. I think what I have with PROPNAME is love, so these miles will either make us or break us for good. Either way I just hope we will always be best friends. He knows me better than anybody and I guess that is a big part of the familiarity I miss. 
__label__label0 Right now I am realizing how tired I am after such a long day of work. I worked all day today and I think I have sneezed at least 000 times. I wonder if I have allergies. My kitten is crawling across the keyboard. Man, do I type really slow or what. I probably won't be able to type very much in 00 minutes. I am really frustrated with by boyfriend right now. I think that must be a "woman thing. " I don't know. Maybe I am a little hard on him. I don't know. I just really wish he could be more open with me a communicate with me better. I really wish he would tell me how he truly feels about me and about us. I am so frustrated with it all. I be psychologists get a lot of complaints about men from us women. I am really sure of that. I am really realizing that men don't communicate very well about relationships. Unless you are talking about football or cars, you might as well forget. it. I really don't know how to take his comment this weekend that he likes cars better than he likes women. I really take offense to that comment. I really think that that is personally directed to me. I don't know. I know he is not sure about us and I pray all the time that he will know how he feels about things and us, but so far that prayer is sill out there. I really don't know what to do now. I am not trying to make him choose me or hit the road, but I just don't want this to drag on for five years of my life and then end. I just don't want to waste any more time in my life. I know if I would have stayed with my high school boyfriend, we would probably be married by now and maybe even be happy, but things never felt complete with him and I am so glad that I realized that back then. With PROPNAME, things feel so much more real and I really think that is why things have seemed so much harder. We have been through a lot this past year together. With my whole surgery and illness, he sure was great. A lot of men that might have to deal with a sick girlfriend going through surgery and IV treatments would run and never look back. Not him. Thankfully God gave him the patience to put up with me and stick things out with me and help me get through such a trying time. This past year really has been a trying one. I was in the hospital numerous times, had about 0 inches of my small and large intestines removed, went through a four month new IV treatment and all at the same time tried to find a medication that would help keep my body in remission. I am thankful that I am now in the remission that I have longed for and I think my doctor has found a successful dosage and mixture of medications that are helping keep me stable. God has answered so may prayers and is continuing to watch over me. Being sick has really opened my eyes to a lot and helped me grow so much as a person. I really have had to grow up dealing with such a horrible illness. Its really hard being 00 dealing with a chronic illness that you know there is no cure for and having to deal with it daily, either by pain or medications or doctors. I think I am down to taking about 00 pills a day now. I was taking about 00. PROPNAME said I would jiggle when I walked. I think I still do. My doctor is continuing to decrease my medications thankfully. Looking at the clock my time is up. Hope this doesn't bore you too much. Take care! 
__label__label0 The walk was refreshing. I should do that more often. I am not sure why not many people take advantage of the beauty of nature and fresh air, and the flowers. My mother loves gardening. We always complain that she spends more time on the garden than on her children. It is just me, my brother and my Dad. Ours is a small family. Not like my neighbors. They have six children. Must be very noisy to live in that family. I like peace and quite when I watch TV or study. I do not think there are any good programs on tonight. I have never watched The West Wing or Will and Grace. Both won the Emmy. They are probably not my type. I just like Friends. This summer there were not any good movies also. Summer really ended so fast. I miss my friend, "S". I don't know what it would be like to be at ORGNAME ORGNAME with her. It is a shame she did not get admission at LOCNAME. I would have loved to share a room with her. My suite mate is OK. I had lunch with her but we do not have much in common. She is much younger and is in drama. I am in Natural Sciences. I am not sure how I decided on Pre Med. and maybe Business. For the longest time I wanted to be a teacher and my brother told me that it would not make me rich. Money is not everything. Well if I become a doctor, i. e. if I ever pass my ORGNAME. Why is life so difficult. I wish life was easier and we could do what we wanted. Better still I wish we did not have to grow up and worry about having a family or making money. I think it is getting warm. I need to turn on the AC. My room mate must be cold blooded. I need circulating air. It keeps me refreshed and relaxed. I am not sure why my parents moved to LOCNAME from LOCNAME. I love the snow and the cold. "T", my friend in LOCNAME, has not replied to my email and she does not even like Instant messaging. I think it is neat that we can do that. I can make friends easily on the net, but face to face is really hard. Everyone thinks I am shy and they are probably true. I had no idea 00 minutes are so long and you can write so much. When I am doing something enjoyable time flies and now it seems that the clock does not move. I need to change this chair. It is so uncomfortable or maybe I can put a pillow on it. I think I will go for another walk after I am done with this. I wander if there is anything good on TV tonight. That fish I ate in the cafeteria is making me sick. I hate the food they serve. I am glad I am going home this weekend. 
__label__label0 well. how do I start? I suppose I'll just start by saying that I am very tired of school I don't even know why so soon I mean my classes aren't all that bad yet but I'm tired of waking up so early to catch the crowded bus and always having to walk everywhere in the heat one thing I am excited about is my boyfriend coming down in less than 0 days to visit me. he's from texas tech and I miss him so much the only bad thing is that I think that I'm hiding myself from the world because I feel safe enough with him that I block out the rest of the world and therefore I am not quite as social as I should be. but I'm really worried that I'm going to lose him and then where will I be? who will I have? oh well can't think of that right now. I'll enjoy my life with him for now long distance relationships are very hard. I don't quite know what will happen but I do know that he is very special to me and every guy I go out with in the future will be compared to him enough about the mushy stuff I'm living with my sister up here its really convenient she takes care of me and we don't really fight a lot she's sick right now I don't know what to do except for buy her medicine I'm a bad nurse oh wells I can't believe we have been in school for bout 0 weeks now. it feels like 0 months everything is moving by so slow I miss LOCNAME I can't wait to go back and visit my family and friends ill be going back in bout 0 weeks or so I hate it that I'm easily distracted when I start on my homework the tv usually gets to me because we have cable and so some really good movie will be on and ill sit there and watch it instead of working on my homework. that's really starting to become a habit and the thing is when the show is finally over and I start on my homework its already 00 and I'm pooped I need better study habits I'm currently a biology major. I don't even think that's what I'm going to follow through here I don't go out partying like most college students I think I should take advantage of my college years here but I really don't like the whole clubbing experience I'm full and I feel like vomiting. I think I ate too many chicken wings. oh wells I hate the computer I'm on the internet connection is really slow and I hate tying on a laptop computer. I'm use to the normal ones I still have a lot of reading to do I have to finish reading in this class and in biology. I hope I don't bomb any of my classes my parents expect me not to since my sister is here and will show me the ropes. do you know how much pressure that is? I feel as if I never seem to make my parents proud enough it comes with the territory. being the middle child is really hard anyways. I miss chili our chinchilla ill get to keep him for about 0 weeks so I'm really excited our apartment is so messy we live like boys I'm getting really tired already. I think ill be up late yet again tonight ill shower tomorrow morning I've dyed my hair 0 times and yet it wont give me the color I want I'm so frustrated I'm frustrated with life with school with love everything when I took the pretesting thing I felt so depressed. everything I was answering about myself was so negative. in some way and so I felt really bad once I was done. that reminds me I have to go check out that bulletin board to check out some experiments I could to do obtain my 0 hours actually now 0 0/0 which is great. I hope they don't make me do anything really weird I'm kind of hesitant to do that stuff oh wells I haven't been out a lot since I've been here in LOCNAME I'm kind of homesick. I miss the simple life I lead when I was in LOCNAME everything has changed things are not so simple anymore I fell as though I'm not as happy here I don't know why though. don't worry. I'm not suicidal or anything I just wish I knew what was bugging me I think. actually I hope things will be fine soon this year is moving by so slow. and its so hard making friends I have at least one friend in each class except for chemistry that really bad because you should really have a study partner in that class I think ill have to make friends in there soon I feel stress stress from the world everything I hate it I get stressed easily sleep is overcoming me. I have to stay awake. I'm already behind in my readings can't get even more behind. I need a major massage my shoulders are so tense. my whole body is tense I like these kinds of writing assignments because it helps release some of my emotions hidden inside some stress has lifted but there's still a lot there well. my time has ended. its been 00 minutes 00 minutes that have flown by ill end it on this note. I need some sleep. I'm going to sleep goodbye. 
__label__label1 Today has been pretty easy. That girl in nursing got on my nerves, but at least I am out of there. For once, I actually do not have a headache yet. And it's already almost noon. I wish I didn't have to go to work today. It's not that I don't like working there, it just takes up so much time. Most of the people are nice. I wish I didn't have to stand up all the time, though. My back itches. It is really hot in my room. Lately, it has been freezing in here. It is probably because I am sitting right by the window. This assignment is really making me tired. However, I actually got almost 0 hours of sleep last night, which is practically a record for a school night. Maybe that is why I don't have a headache yet. Tonight, though, I need to go to the gym and work out. I have only worked out once since I've been here. I think I am getting out of shape, even though I seem to walk miles to my classes everyday. Oh well, it's not like I'm overweight or anything. I am probably losing weight since the cafeteria food is pretty bad sometimes. It used to make me sick for the first few days I was here. My neck itches now. I think it is moving! Oh my goodness I can't wait until this weekend. I finally get to go home and eat some normal food. Most of all, I get to see PROPNAME. I miss him so much. I'm not really lonely all the time without him, but I am never really happy like I used to be. But after I see him for a few days and have to leave him again, I am sure I'll be pretty lonely. It makes me realize what is was like to be there with him all the time. Now my head itches. My back hurts. I haven't had a massage since I've been here. That would be so nice. Anyways, I just ate a nasty lunch and I feel kind of nauseous. Yuck. Dinner tonight is Mexican food and I think I'll walk to the union to eat. I am really tired now. This type of writing seems to put me into a trance. I feel like I need to take a nap now. I don't think that is possible though, since I have to be at work in about 00 minutes. At least that is the last thing I have to do today. I don't think I even have any homework. Maybe I'll take a nap after work. Well, actually, I need to call PROPNAME after work. Maybe I'll take a nap after that. The room seems like it has cooled off a lot. Maybe the air conditioner finally kicked in. My neck and back are so stiff. I want to lay down so bad but I know that if I do, I'll probably fall asleep. My roommate slept in this morning. That was a good idea. I can't wait to see PROPNAME. This weekend should be so much fun. I get all anxious hoping that everything goes well. I haven't seen my parents in 0 weeks. I know my mom is just dying to see me and my brother. I need to email her. I need to email PROPNAME too. I wonder what PROPNAME is up to. Maybe I should call him. I don't think I will because he is probably in class and I really don't want to talk to his roommate. Speaking of roommates, I need to talk to my ra. about the roommate contract she emailed us about. I have no idea what she is talking about. Oh well. My twenty minutes in finally over. I think I will go lay down. 
__label__label1 Ok, I've just turned off the news so the thing that I have on my mind right now is the up and coming election. I really can't stand PROPNAME, he is so robotic, I don't understand how anyone can stomach looking at him or listening to him. Now I am debating whether or not to get up and turn off the television or if I should just sit here and listen to the noise annoy me. Well I have decided to turn it off, ok that's much better, now I can write a more accurate account of what I am thinking. I really don't know what to write, I have never done anything like this before. My computer is really getting on my nerves because it isn't fast enough to keep up with my typing, and I can't stand all the little red squiggly lines that show what all I have misspelled thus far. I don't like not being able to fix it, and now the phone is ringing and that really bothers me because it breaks my concentration even more. Well it turned out to be a wrong number, someone looking for PROPNAME, I know this because my roommate had to answer on speaker phone, now it is ringing again and it was that girl that had the wrong number, this time she just hung up. What a moron, I mean really how much guts does it really take to fess up and say that you were dumb enough to dial the same wrong number twice? Not saying that I haven't done it before because I most definitely have but I also told the person I was sorry for interrupting them twice. My computer is really getting on my last nerve. I feel like asking my dad to buy me another one. Now that I have said that it reminds me about how everyone always says what a spoiled brat I am for getting everything that I want. I don't think its my fault that my dad loves me so much. I think that my brothers do though. Speaking of brothers, I rode out with my brother PROPNAME yesterday and that was really fun. I think that if I wasn't so caught up in money and status I would become a paramedic instead of a doctor. Oh well maybe I'll become an ER doctor. That would be pretty cool. I just watched ER tonight and it was pretty good. PROPNAME PROPNAME reminds me of PROPNAME's friend PROPNAME, he's really nice but he is married to a psycho just like PROPNAME is. I used to want to be a psychiatrist but after last night I defiantly don't want to do that. We ran a call on a girl that over dosed on her anxiety medication. All she did was whine about how no one loved her and all of her friends had boyfriends, just like Sunni. Sometimes I wish that I could be a writer like PROPNAME PROPNAME. He is really awesome. I know that this sounds really morbid but I almost can't wait for him to die so that we can read more of his work. And if that sounded bad another person that could keel over at any given moment is "Deep throat," from the PROPNAME scandal, I would really like to know who that is. I really don't want these people to die, I mean I wouldn't wish that on anyone, I just would like to find out some more things. Oh well I have about two more minutes and I can stop writing this. I'm glad that no one is going to read it because that would be really embarrassing. I can't believe how much stuff I am misspelling. It's like I never attended first grade. Well I did fail spelling in the fifth grade but doesn't that make me a genius? 
__label__label0 I am a freshman at LOCNAME but it is not a new experience for me. My older brother and sister both went here and PROPNAME brother is still here to help me out which is awesome for me. I see so many confused freshman everyday even though it's already the 0rd week ORGNAME school and they should know where they're going but they don't. I'm just really glad that it's not me. I am really independent however so this would be a fun experience, not scary, even if I was all alone. I like to look at things as being an adventure instead of a danger. I do go home every other weekend though because my boyfriend, who happens to be my brother's best friend, goes to the ORGNAME ORGNAME of ORGNAME. LOCNAME is where I am from although it has changed a lot since I first moved there. I can't wait until this Thursday when I can go home to see PROPNAME, my boyfriend again. I have been in serious relationships before but never have I been so much in love. Ever since we starting dating both of us just knew that we were going to be together for the rest of our lives. I can't wait to get done with school, start my job as an elementary school teacher, and be married to the love of my life. As corny and "Leave it to Beaver" as that may sound, that is really what I want to do. My real life goal was always just to be a Mom and nothing else. I didn't want a "real job" as they're called even though being a housewife is much harder than many highranking jobs out there. But, my PROPNAME said that I was too smart to do that and that if one day I just happened to be on my own I needed a good education so that I could have a good job to support myself or my kids with. It actually never occurred to me that I wouldn't go to college until he said that. I wanted to go to college for 0 years, but I guess I was just thinking that I wouldn't have a major but still graduate somehow. I was young then and didn't quite know how this whole college thing worked yet. But, anyhow, here I am and I'm loving it. It is such a refreshing changed from high school where you feel like you are going to a prison every day where they freeze you to death and make you tired as hell. But there was really no possible way to fall asleep because it was always way too cold to relax. So it really was like torture in that it was as if they were filling you full of some sleeping agent but holding your eyelids open for 0 hours. Enough about that though, bad memories. I am here now not knowing quite what to expect. I took summer classes at a really, really easy junior college this summer and have enough credits to be a sophomore when spring semester starts. The faster I get out, the better. But I know that ORGNAME is nothing like a junior college in any way. And I also know that no matter how easy a class seems during lecture, the tests are always hard and are nothing to take lightly. Which is good because if this school was easy, I wouldn't learn anything that I would remember longer than the test. But, it also puts a hamper on some of those freshman who expect it to be like high school. They go out on weeknights and party and don't get home until the next morning and then get up for class 0 hours later. And maybe they could pull that in high school and get away with it, or maybe they never did that in high school and are just experimenting with their new found freedom. Either way, they are going to get a big slap in the face when their first test rolls around. But that is their problem and not mine, although life would be much kinder to them if they would have learned that during high school. 
__label__label1 I am in a hurry right now. I have a retreat to go to in 00 minutes, which is at the end of this writing. I feel very rushed and very sweaty. Personally, I don't like long term assignments. I usually end up doing things at the last minute (like now) usually do to forgetfulness on my part. That's one of those college things that I have to adjust to. Other things I have to adjust to are the food, independency, new friends, new people, different people, persecution, etc. , etc. However, I really like this place because of the above reasons. For a majority of my life, I've been mostly independent, living in a singleparent family with one younger sibling. My mom took care of me and my brother, but she would always work. I didn't have much of a father figure growing up either. My parents got divorced, and my dad moved to LOCNAME and got remarried. I stayed with my brother and my mom in LOCNAME. During those times, I grew and learned a lot about life, by myself. That was the catch. Everyone learns about life, the right things, the wrong things, in some way or form, usually from their parents. However, since my mom always worked, and I didn't have a father figure, I learned about life by myself. I made mistakes, I made several wrong decisions, and I did things that I regret. However, I also learned a wealth of knowledge that I feel others my age do not possess. I was ahead of the peers around me, in life and in experiences. My independency started at an early age, one could say. I learned to take care of my brother, as well as other everyday tasks. Do you know how many people on this campus don't know how to do their laundry?! It's insanely too many. For many students, their parents have pampered them and done their laundry for them for their whole lives. And then they come to a university where they have to do it by themselves and have no clue what detergent to use, how much, how to separate clothes, or even what fabric softener is. In the past 0 weeks, I've done my laundry twice now in the dorms. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME, and since their is construction going on, our laundry hours are from 0pm to 0am. These hours suck because from 0 to about midnight, there are people crowding the place. Also, I'm usually out during those times, at the gym, arcade, eating, whatnot. So, the last two times I've done laundry, it's been at 0am in the morning. The washing cycles takes 00 min while the drying takes 00 min, totaling to about an hour and half, given loading and transferring time. The first time I did it, my roommate was with me. We stuck our clothes in at 0am, and came back at 0 to stick it in the dryer. But at 0:00am, we realized that our laundry was still down there. However, we were still in our room playing video games. We ran down there and found that the door was locked. Our clothes were stuck in the laundry room for the rest of the day. We wouldn't be allowed in until 0pm that day. This was especially bad for me because I had practically run out of pants. However, I seemed to have made it through. So, the second time I did laundry, I did it myself. Again, it was at 0:00 in the morning when I stuck it in. This time, however, I made sure that I wouldn't get locked out. So during washing and drying, I slept on the ground by the laundry room door. My drying actually didn't finish until about 0:00am. To my dismay, they did not lock the door this time at 0. I was very frustrated and tired; but glad I had clean clothes. Anyway, I miss my family. I really don't want to live with them again. I just want to see them and talk to them more than I already do. My mom calls me everyday. I think it's annoying, but I'm sad because I think it's annoying. My younger brother is getting involved with some bad friends and school, and our mutual friends tell me about it, but I can't do anything. I'm also sad because of that. There are more reasons I'm sad. The drawing for tickets for the LOCNAME vs. OU game went on yesterday(Thursday). Each student had to get a wristband with a certain number on it (mine was 00000). It was given out at random. They started the drawing on Thursday with number 00000. By 00000, tickets were already sold out. Guess I won't be going to the game. That really stinks. It's ok though it would've cost me $00. I'd rather go to free games anyway. I think my 00 minutes are about up now. Again, I am still in a hurry to leave, since my ride for the retreat will be leaving soon. Goodnight. sort of good afternoon. 
__label__label1 Well, the twenty minutes start now. It feels strange having to write out what I am thinking. Seeing as how I've never had a diary or journal, I've never had to do this before. Funny how your mind draws a blank when you are supposed to be writing what you are thinking at that very instant. A whole minute has gone by and I can not think of anything to type. I guess that's kind of the purpose. don't think ahead for once, just let everything come out just as quickly as it comes in. all day long, my mind has been jumbled up with. well, stuff, and now I can't seem to remember what all the "stuff" was. Gosh, it's early and I'm already tired. It's not that today was stressful, just very hot and tiring. I can't wait until the weather finally cools off. I wish I could sleep in tomorrow. I wish I could go to sleep now. I hope what I actually write isn't important. After all, it's only a completion grade, right? I hope so. Sigh. Now that I'm thinking about it, this class kind of worries me, after 0 class days in here, I'm still not sure what to study or what to write down in my notes, the TA at the supplemental instructions class, I can't remember her name at the moment, says that we should pay attention to the book and the notes. But I think we wanted a more concise answer. My philosophy class is exactly the same. No body knows what to write in their notes, after all, all the notes we take are basically made up of questions. I'm a bit nervous about my first test in that class. And we are only going to have three, and that's counting the final. It has its good and bad points I guess. Double standard. Since I've started college, it seems like everything is a double standard. I don't live on campus that has its good and bad points. Umm, what else? Lots of things. hard to come with them right now. Dang, I still have to read for my writing class. ugh, that book is boring, I hope I don't fall asleep reading it again. More than likely I will seeing as how I'm sleepy right now. I think I should just read tomorrow while I'm on the shuttle to school. That'd be good. Oh, I can't. I have to get on the early bus tomorrow, it's going be too packed to be able to concentrate. Guess I have to read tonight. Oh well. Gosh, I'm tired. Wait. My mom always calls when I'm in the middle of something. Weird. Why did she need my schedule? I bet so she could call when she knows I'm not in class. I know this sounds bad, but I don't want to talk to her everyday. Every time she calls, she sounds like she's upset with me. I think she's mad because I left home. But it's not like I went out of the country, or out of state for that matter. I'm only 0 hours away, and I'm going home this weekend to visit anyway. She doesn't have reason to be upset with me. She's supposed to happy and proud. It was always hard to make her proud. Nothing ever seemed good enough for her. But not my dad, he's different. As long as I tried, my dad was always proud of me; I love him for that. Well, there goes my timer. 00 minutes is up. Thank you. 
__label__label1 Well, after reading the assignment I began to wonder how on earth I could track my thoughts and feelings in my mind. I mean, does the professor want some sort of biological explanation? Because I just got through about half of chapter 0 and the whole neural process. My dendrites are busy sending neurons through my axon every supermillisecond, right? Then again, I'm sure those thought processes do not include all my feelings because I do think a lot. For example, now I am debating whether I should go to dinner or not, but I can't leave in the middle of this assignment so I guess I'm going to wait about 00 more minutes. To track my mind. let's see, most of my thoughts come pretty random (at least they do to everyone around me when I think aloud) and. uh oh, my roommate is talking pretty loud to me, influencing my thought process. Not that I have an attention disorder, it was just a slight distraction  like the music that's playing in my dorm room right now. I wonder how long it would take to read about 000 students' thought processeswould that start to influence your own? For some reason, every time I start hanging around a new crowd of people every few years, I start thinking like them. Is that an aspect of societal/cultural influence, or does it happen to everyone? Thinking is something that occurs all the time. For example, even when I want to stop thinking and go to sleep at night, thoughts just keep wandering in. I guess it usually comes from my visual observations during the day and the little things spark new thoughts that occur either right then or much later in the day. Oh, I just remembered I should probably save this page before anything happens to it  but would that take up time in my writing process? Oh well, only a few more minutes left and then I save. I guess I'm kind of stumped as to what I should keep writing. I'm trying to explain how I think and how much I think, but the words are hard to come by. This happens a lot, though. Whenever I understand something in my head, it's hard to explain it by mouth. Some people have absolutely no problem changing these chemical messages into physical sounds, but I can totally blank on words that I say everyday sometimes. I think pretty fast, though, so maybe the time it takes to transfer from my head to my mouth is just slower? I guess since I'm writing this for a psychology class, psychological thoughts come to my head. I have a whole bunch of questions, and I usually make up my own answers to explain them  but I usually find out my explanations are incorrect. Right now I'm not feeling too well: I have a stomachache and my throat is all dry and scratchy. So, I start assessing why this could be  maybe it's the dirty air here that I've been breathing for a few weeks, maybe it's the water, or could it have come from my roommate who has a cold? But my stomach hurts, too. Is it the dorm food that is causing it? Is it the heat outside that is so unbearable? I wonder if it is from stomach acidity or stress? Nowadays I cannot tell if my bad health occurs from stress or from real factors. Will I ever find a cure to keep myself healthy at all times? Is there any way to be rid of stress? There are so many questions, but probably only one right answer. Who knows that answer? When will I find out? When will these 00 minutes be up? I wonder what other people are writing about. What do you think about through another person's eyes? I think I should stop asking questions and start explaining more about my thoughts and feelings  but aren't my questions an explanation in itself? I think its interesting that psychology covers biology, because wouldn't that mean there is something permanent about your personality in your brain? The question of nature vs. nurture has always interested me. I've always wondered if its both part nature and part nurture that influences the way we think. Does anyone think as much as me? 
__label__label1 I don't like IceBreaker's gum because the flavor crystals sometimes don't break down in your mouth, and the texture is just plain disturbing. I won a huge pack of IceBreaker's gum from Pro Grad and I now feel obligated to make use of it even though I dislike it. I do that a lot. I eat foods that I don't really like just to make my mom happy. It is not really a big deal. I usually tell people what I like and what I dislike, but sometimes I don't. My grandma uses coconut in her sweets, and I don't like coconut, but I use to eat it anyway. One day I just stopped and she didn't really notice. I was like, "Man I could have stopped a long time ago, but instead I didn't. " Okay that makes no sense, but I do not always make sense. My mind jumps from thing to thing, and I digress a lot. I get off track often. Love is a funny thing; it is so hard to really say what it is. To me love is about small things that people don't really notice, but those in love do. I cannot really give an example; but then again that could be because my mind is not really focused on this topic. I can get deep and all emotional when I feel the moment calls for it, but right now I am just not really in a "deep" mood. I still have to read my Chemistry and read my Cyberreader for my Cyberpunk class. Why am I taking a Cyberpunk class? I have no idea. I like to try and experience new things so I decided to take it. Actually, it was the only one that fit into my schedule and had a writing component that accompanied it. Ummm eleven more minutes to go. what to say. I love to be happy. I hate to be sick. I love to go swimming or to stay in the shower for really long periods of time when I am sick. The water just seems to clear up and free my nasal passages. I don't want to do my reading assignments. I want to just go for a walk or go out with my boyfriend. I want to go see "The Cell" with PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME. I can be such a teenager sometimes. I do some of the most immature and silly things. I can fall all over myself when I see a cute boy band, and I can gush over how wonderful it would be to be a superstar and have a superstar boyfriend. PROPNAME PROPNAME, a country singer, has a song called "Ordinary People". It is about how ordinary people have extraordinary love. It talks about how when superstars breakup, and how when they do breakup up that they probably wish they could be ordinary. The great thing about not being a superstar is having your privacy. I can't imagine being photographed all the time. I don't look good in photos when I am posing, so you can only imagine how awful I would look in ones where I do not pose. I sit here writing this and try to think of what you all will think when you read it. You all will see the section about me not liking to be photos and then draw from that that I have selfconfidence issues. I can sit on a dorm chair and swing my feet. I like being short. I like that people view me as cute just because I am short. Being short is good if you are a girl because it would suck it your crush was shorter than you. I just like the idea of the guy being tall. My boyfriend is six feet tall, and that makes us look cuter because I look so cute and little next to him, and for some reason I think that makes us look cuter. Why do they call the prestage room the green room? The green room is often not even green. I don't understand that. I don't understand a lot of things like why the sky is blue, and why the grass is green. Except of course for in way west LOCNAME where there is no grass and if there is it is yellow and tan. I hate people who are hypocrites. I think that you should stand up for what you believe in, and if you don't know what to believe in then don't stand up on your soapbox going in circles. I wish I was smarter. I wish I could sing. that would be a great talent just because I like to sing. Two minutes to go! I can't help but look at the clock. I am the type of person who has to thumb through the pages of my reading assignment and see how many more pages I have to read. I am very impatient, but I am patient when I feel it is necessary. Times Out! The End! 
__label__label0 College presents a life that is quite different from home life! Having to adjust the many changes is both challenging and fun! Doing laundry is a task that I am almost positive that I will never become accustomed to! It is boring and time consuming! When I visit home I appreciate the clean clothes in my closet even more, since they are clean and I wasn't the one to clean them! However, the independence I now have is unexplainable. I realize that I am in control ORGNAME my life now and the direction I will go! Sure I had control of my life before college, but my parents were there to guide me and make sure I made the right decision. Now it's all up to me to make the right choices. I have to be the one to say, "I don't want to go out tonight. " And when my friends persist, I can't use the excuse, my parents won't let me, which makes it even more difficult! I know college will present me with as many challenges to overcome as well as fun memories that I will cherish forever. I am excited about my next four years here and am quite sure that with my determination and hard work, I will succeed not only at The ORGNAME of ORGNAME, but in life as well!  
__label__label1 My day has been a really good day today. I meet up with my ex boyfriend and went out to lunch with him at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Then we began to talk about the idea of seeing other people and we got in a relatively big argument. He accused me of seeing another guy and I told him the truth that I was seeing another guy. We talked to each other and told ourselves that we were going to try and fix and mend the relationship that we once had. It made me feel a lot better about myself because for the past couple of months I have been feeling very depressed and gloomy about myself. I wanted to talk to somebody and when PROPNAME came around and wanted to talk to me for the first time in a long time about the problems that we were having it made me feel a lot better. PROPNAME is my ex boyfriend, just to let you know. The when I got home I started thinking about how far behind I was on all of my school work and I began to stress out about all of the reading and studying that needed to be accomplished in such a short time frame. Then I was thinking about what my Health Promotion teacher told us about relaxing to alleviate stress and other worries that we are having with our lives right now. So I am just now beginning to calm down about my school work and the other stresses in my life right now and trying to pace myself so that I can stay ahead. So I am finally getting to this writing assignment that I had no idea about until last Monday. This just added to the stress that I was feeling about my life but now some of it is off my shoulders because I am doing this assignment. I am worried about my mom right now also because she just went through a divorce and now I am out of her life and not living with her so she really doesn't have anyone to talk to. She always sounds so miserable on the phone when I talk to her and she makes me feel bad for leaving home even when she wanted me to leave. My dad and my mother just recently got a divorce and it has torn all of our lives up but I think that it has torn my mother's life up the most. She had change jobs and start a new life over without my father and his harassing ways to hold her back from wanting the most from her life. She acts so depressed when I hear from her and in turn it makes me feel very depressed about my life too. I love my mother to death but I just wish that she would keep me out of her problems and go seek some help from someone who can actually help her. Anyways I think that school is going to turn out really good and I hope that I can keep up my grades and make it into the ORGNAME ORGNAME. I am already into the Pre ORGNAME ORGNAME but I have to test into the Nursing School in order to become a Registered Nurse. I am excited about fulfilling my life long dream about becoming a nurse and helping out people who are need of assistance and love. I want to work with children in a pediatric doctors office when I graduate. I really do not want to work in an emergency room with very sick people who come in there almost dead and there is no chance for us to save them. I want to help people out and I don't want to feel like I didn't help them out by letting a person die. 
__label__label1 I guess that I should start by telling you where I am. I am in my dorm room at Castilian. I only had one class today, Calculus. I don't really like Calculus that much. But it hasn't been too bad so far. I want to call my old band director and tell him good luck tonight. Tonight is their first football game and they are playing the Astrodome. I got to play in the Astrodome once. It was really cool. At first I was really envious of my friends still in high school because they were going to get to play there again. But then I realized that I was going to get to play at the LOCNAME LOCNAME and at many other great stadiums across the country throughout my time here at LOCNAME. My roommate is playing a video game now and I'd really rather be doing that. Not because I dislike this assignment, but because I haven't gotten to play any games in a long time. School and band are taking up a lot of my time. But I think that is good. I like to stay busy. Last year in high school I was in band, jazz band, choir, pop choir, mock trial, KEY club, a little student council, and track. I had a great time and was doing stuff constantly. I would like to have that kind of life here. I think that I would like to join a fraternity, ORGNAME ORGNAME, a Bible Study group, mock trial, and anything else I can find time for. I like being a part of many different things. That way I can have friends from all over and with many different interests. LOCNAME has been very interesting so far. I love the way my schedule works. I am through with my classes today and it is only 00:00 (The day by the way is Friday if anybody is actually reading this). I think that I would like for somebody to read this even though it isn't the most exciting paper in the world. At least then I wouldn't have written it just see how accurately I type. Anyways, I'm not sure what I should be writing about. Uhhhh. My parents are going to be here tonight. They are coming up here (or over here technically) to watch me march at my first college football game. My mom is really excited. My dad is also but he is also coming to see the game. My mom could careless about the game. All right! Only 0 more minutes. Uhhh. I have a really nice view of the city from my room. It's on the twentyfirst floor. It really sucks trying to get up here on an elevator though. And it's really hard trying to find a place to practice my trumpet in a dorm. I tried the roof but it was locked. I'm really hungry now and that's good because I only have about thirty more seconds to type. Yaady yaady yaady and now I'm done. I am going to go eat. Thank you to whoever has read this. And if nobody has or ever will, there isn't much that I can do about it. 
__label__label1 Well, all that is on my mind sure cannot be summed up in twenty minutes, but I will continually type for that time. Lately I have desired to do nothing but become closer to God. He is awesome. My freshman year of high school was great all because I had God on my side. Now I feel like I have lost him. I know He is still there for me, but I have damaged that relationship that we had. I chose to live my life and not listen to Him. It hurts because life was stressfree and I always knew that God was just right there waiting for me everywhere I went. When I would walk outside I would smile and greet God with open arms. Now I feel like sometimes I look negatively upon the weather and don't even think of the great God who made everything. I have been trying to become closer to God. I read in the Bible more often. Rather than praying for myself or for God to do great works in my life, I now ask God what I can do to better the lives of others. I think that my outlook on life will change once I fully begin to ask Him what He wants of me rather than demanding Him to help me. I think once my relationship with Him improves, my money worries will go away. One worry is about transferring out of the school of business. I could transfer out of the business school, but I am afraid of what my future holds. I know with a business degree at ORGNAME jobs will be flying at me from every direction. Instead of being a cutthroat businesswoman, I want to help society. If I would get paid a good amount, I would definitely help the homeless or disabled. That attitude is wrong. God does not want me to think like that. He wants me to trust that He will provide all my financial necessities. He wants me to pray to Him to find out what I need to do in life. He will give me meaning once I am fully ready to accept His answer. I continually pray to God asking Him what I am to do with my life. He has not told me. I do not think it is that He has not told me; I think He has told me to wait for the right time for him to tell me. I know He will let me know when He feels I am ready to accept the task He has prepared for me. Right now I long to know what that task is. As I read the Bible daily and pray to Him daily, I feel I am taking one step closer to receiving a better understanding of my life and knowing what I am destined to do. I cannot wait until God shows me the way to my career, my husband, my kids, my destiny, but I always have to remember what my mom says. God and her both agree: patience is a virtue and in order to obtain these goals, I need to be patient. 
__label__label0 I am so tired right now. I don't understand any of the psychology professor pennebaker is talking about. what does he mean is this a good experiment? How can you tell?

I hope I can sneak him and bobby in. what are they going to do if I get caught? I don't know, PROPNAME did it successfully. I can't spell anything or type right. this assignment isn't hard, I hope they are all this easy because I know I'm going to have trouble in this class. I want it to rain real bad. I miss my mom and PROPNAME. I wonder what daddy is doing. I need some music in here. Doug better burn me a cd too. I can't believe my mom bought that frame for me. I wonder if she might like him now. I don't even see him now. maybe that's why she likes him. I don't want to get sick. I don't have a mommy. I sound like PROPNAME. very immature and youngish. I need to grow up, I'm referred to as a woman now. what ever. my hands and wrists hurt from typing. I'm not used to this. I hated my teacher. he was fat and old. why does my computer do that? It so annoying. I need to get excel on here. maybe I should buy it. 0 bucks not bad. damnit it's doing it again! I hate this. stupid red lines, I know I spelled it wrong! PROPNAME is on again. I wish we were still good friends. why is the sun out? I want rain. my head itches. its too cold here. my right forearm is now aching. I need to take a shower. I should get started on that speech, I wonder if what I have is enough. I like PROPNAME. the is young looking. quiz. read chapter 0 and 00. PROPNAME said she skimmed it. ill do that instead, easier. still have to skim psych. I hate that class. I'm such an idiot. shouldn't be in there. I want chocolate. why do I have to wait like that! Stupid computer. he sheneil! Yea, she's back. why? What's wrong with them. I'm sorry, I wish I could help you. that sucks. you maybe, mine are bothering me too. I'm getting too much drainage. I don't want to get sick. I haven't been coughing again, so that's good. this a such a weird assignment. I can't believe the thing said I haven't turned it in. I did it twice now. what a waste of time. he won't even read this. I could say fuck you pennebaker and he wouldn't know. not like id really say it, he is a funny guy, I am just dumb about his material. he doesn't stick to the book and give us good notes. I hate experiments. shit I still have to do economics. I can't get the hang of this college thing. PROPNAME is gone. I wanted to talk to him when I was done with this. I love PROPNAME. I can't wait until Friday. at least I can sleep on the way up there. I still have 00 minutes left. damn this assignment. I like sheneil a lot. its weird to know I'm saying one thing to her and thinking another. I'm so bored. I have other things to be doing instead of this. ok, think a little bit more about the speech and read, no skim, the rest of ch0 for psy, like that will help. this is hard because I can't spell and this computer is retarded. I hate this ;laptop! Who invented this anyways. I don't even take it to class. because I can't type and all my notes would not make any sense. sorry grandma. oh well, she doesn't know. I want chocolate right now. PROPNAME cookies. brynn is a very weird girl. I'm going to ha to spell check this, I hope that's allowed, other wise. well they wont read it anyways. www. psy. utexas. edu/what is is? Jp000 I think. I hate this chair. I want my one from home. i'll get it later when I go home. gnome? what is that? Ok time up 
__label__label0 Ok I have to type for twenty minutes straight. This is kind of odd, I've never done anything like this before so I don't quite know what to do! I should be doing my economics homework but forget it, I'll do it later. I don't even understand it anyways. Calculus is a pain in the back too, I'll wait until Monday to do that homework. I can't wait to go home this weekend and see all my old friends. It's been a while since we've all hung out. I hope I don't miss any really good parties this weekend, but I probably will. In a little while I have to go take a shower and get ready to go out with the girls at the house. We'll probably go to 0th Street or something like that. I'm glad I finally get to go out tonight, I've been sitting in my room for a week straight. Ok I'm bored and am running out of things to say already. I have nothing else to think about right now! ORGNAME ORGNAME is on the TV and I'm getting annoyed with PROPNAME whining. Why is the TV on this channel anyways? I guess my roommate put it on. I'm glad she's gone right now. I needed some peace and quiet. I'm getting real hungry I hope PROPNAME wants to go eat soon. Gosh I still have another load of laundry I have to do before I leave tomorrow. I get to sleep in until one tomorrow because I don't have class until 0. That rocks. My room is so messy but I'm way too lazy to clean it right now. It's dusty more than cluttered. Oh well, I'll get over it. Hold on my phone is ringing. It's my boyfriend PROPNAME just saying hi as usual. I wish I saw him more. It's a lot easier now that I'm in LOCNAME but it's still not the same as living in the same town. Oh I totally forgot that he can't go to LOCNAME LOCNAME this weekend, looks like I'll be without him again. I really need to catch up with some of my old friends this weekend. We need to party and hang out like we used to. I might end up going to the high school football game if there is nothing else to do. I just don't want to look like a hasbeen with a bunch of high school students and then a college student just chilling out there. Ha ha that might be pretty funny actually. I'll get PROPNAME to come with me so I don't feel too stupid. Oh I like this song. I wanted to go to the concert but the tickets were all sold out. Speaking of tickets I never did get the PROPNAME PROPNAME tickets for the September show in LOCNAME. I can't believe I forgot to get them. Now I'll never get tickets. Looks like I'll miss out on yet another awesome concert. At least I'm in LOCNAME now. No good bands come to LOCNAME LOCNAME, so I'll get to go to plenty of concerts here. I still haven't gotten my stupid Ethernet Card yet. I went to the computer store earlier but they didn't have any more for laptops. This stupid thing isn't worth all the trouble! This song is so annoying. I need to find that remote control right now. Much better. I think this is PROPNAME's CD. He has plenty of mine so it's ok if I don't give this back for a while. He won't miss it. Ok I really am so bored and hungry it's unreal. I need to take a shower but I'll just wait until this thing is done. Two more minutes. I can do that. I want to go dancing tonight. That sounds like fun. None of my friends back in SA want to go so I'll find some of the KD's to go with me. My room is so crowded with pointless junk. I should take some of it back home this weekend but I probably won't just because I'll forget or something will come up. I need to get this roll of film developed sometime soon so I can put some new pictures up. I'm sick of looking at all these old ones. Well my time is just about up for this thing so bye bye for now! 
__label__label1 Its hard to think about what to write of when you are told to, although maybe its hard because things have become more difficult as of late. It must be the typical freshman story but even though we all try to be so different when we come here we all end up in the same boat. It so much like high school its hard to believe, we'll the social part of it is anyway. Sometimes I wonder what I would do if there weren't music in the world. At times it seems to be the only thing that keeps people together, although you never hear many people talk about it in that light. What is even more interesting is how depressing and sentimental most of these essays will be. I wonder how many people will write about how depressed they are and how no one really knows the real them and how hard it is to wake up in the morning. Its hard to differentiate between what is real and what is a line out of a movie that someone is saying these days. So maybe that's why everyone tries to be different. I really don't know. But as everyday passes it seems like people lose a sense of the beauty in the world. There isn't anything much more beautiful to me than the sunset or just sitting outside. I find shadows especially beautiful, I'm sure that it holds some underlying meaning to it that I find shadows pretty. Something about how since I like them that I feel that I'm in the shadows of life, but maybe I am. I just feel more alive sometimes when I sit outside in absolute stillness and let everything live around me. I feel as if I'm living with it. Strange I know, but true. I have always felt that if I were to die I would like to die lying in a field in the afternoon listening to music. I have a picture by PROPNAME that reminds me of a field that was behind my house when I was younger. It seems that those times were so much better than times are now. I wonder if I'll ever be as happy as I was back then again someday. And I'm not alone in that thought. Responsibilities just keep piling up day by day and I just wish that there were a break. It would be nice to be a rock star someday, I feel that if I were up there on stage that I would be so much happier. But I know that I probably would feel the same as I do now. I need to do something that will get me recognized someday, I feel as if I'm destined for fame somehow. But as it is now I feel like I'll end up in a dead end life like most others. I know that most say that there are many other things that make life worth living even though they have a job that they hate. But I would rather be a bum then have a job that I hated. I would feel like I sold myself out in someway. Transcendence is something that has always interested me. Mostly the idea that I could transcend life and become something greater than it. The way the words come off ones tongue when they say that makes me feel warm. I envy authors that have a mastery of language. It would be awesome to write something that when people read it they would be overcome with emotions. Hopefully I'll make enough money in my life that I can stop working and spend all my time making music. I just wish I had the balls to become a musician and do what I want, but if I do I feel like I'll be a failure to all those that I've told that I'm going to be a doctor and what not. Its a nice business its just that there isn't much recognition in it unless you put your whole life in it. And I don't think that I could put my whole life into it since I don't think I would enjoy it. 
__label__label1 I've been thinking and this "freshman fifteen" thing has to be an urban legend. I mean, really, I've never walked so much in my entire life. Everything is about a fifteen minute walk from my dorm so I figure, if I walk to class to my dorm to class to lunch to my dorm, that has to be a few miles just walking the campus. Then I run errands and visit my friends and before I know it I've had an entire week's workout. And then when I have extra time I go to the gym and I know I'm not alone on this because it's always so damn full. For instance, tonight the entire weight room was full and every last piece of equipment was being used. So I know I'm not the only one who walks, like 00 miles a day and still goes to the gym. But let's suppose I rode the Campus Loop everywhere and didn't go to the gym, then would I gain weight? No because the Jester cafeteria is not somewhere I go for seconds. Of course the food isn't the worst I've ever eaten, but I'm definitely not going to over indulge in it. And on top of all of that they post the fat grams at the buffet line. There is no way to ignore the fact that you're eating unhealthy. It's all spelled out for you six inches from your face. Cheese Pizza: 00 grams of fat; Hamburger Topping: 0 grams of fat. How can you ignore that? But I guess these are all positive things because the freshmen fifteen is definitely something I want to avoid. I am willing to eat small portions of not so good food, walk 00 miles a day, and still go to them gym because Gosh Darn It! I will not gain the freshman fifteen. I will not. I won't let it happen. I will break the rules and not follow the fate of college students past. I can't do it. I won't do it. I will not gain the freshman fifteen. Besides, it's just an urban legend anyway. 
__label__label0 This is going to be a cool assignment. We just get to talk about what is going on right now in our lives. I think college is going to be really awesome. We are going to learn so much from all the different types of classes we are taking. I am very tired from classes today. It is tiring to walk all around campus. I will not take the loop cause I don't want to be lost or anything. I think that would be scary to get lost on the loop. My roommate just left to the coop. She has to return all these books. My computer is pretty slow and I hope it doesn't break down while I am typing this. I think that Jester is pretty nice. I am glad that my suitemates are really cool. They take me places cause they have cars. One is from PROPNAME, and my other suitemate is from LOCNAME. My really good friend is sleeping, because she is waiting for me to eat. We are going to go eat at Jester probably. It should be interesting cause I really don't like to eat Jester food that much. It was alright at lunch, but I think it is going to be pretty gross tonight. People stare in the windows at Jester. It is weird to think that there are people out there that could be looking at you. It is really has a pretty courtyard though. I am so tired. I don't think I have much homework to do tonight though. It should be interesting, because I have to write a paper for English. I really don't know what I should write it about though. I have no idea. PROPNAME is a really cool place. You get to run and workout. I like to play volleyball. That has been lots of fun being able to play at night. LOCNAME has really cool places to see around it too. I think I have eaten out so much. People here are so different. I think that is really cool though cause if they weren't, this place would be really boring and stuff. The computer is sometimes a waste of time. I know so many people that just sit and chat on the computer for hours. I think it is really fun too, but you don't need to stay on it for a couple of days. People think that college is really easy and therefore don't have to study. I think they are going to get a rude awakening sometime. My suitemate is trying to work her computer. It is pretty funny cause she doesn't really know how to work it. My sisters just sent me a care package. It was really cool. It had like some soap, and candy. It also had like pictures and stuff. I have to move out soon cause of the pipes are being installed. Well, my friend says to write about the future. I don't know about the future. It should be pretty interesting I hope. I think that I will have to study a lot this year. My sister is going to try to help me out though hopefully. She is going to have it hard. I am going to play I'M sports. I hopefully will be able to handle everything cause I know it is really going to be hard and stuff. I eat too much. I am pretty full and all, and we are going to go eat soon. I only have a couple more minutes so I will talk about how my computer is not working. For some reason when I got home it was broken. My friend tried to fix it. I think it will be alright. My favorite tennis player won the US Open yesterday. It was pretty cool. He is really cool. He is from LOCNAME. I am tired once again. I just want to finish this. I have taken Psychology before so I hopefully will be able to help my friends also that are in my class. All the people from where I am from all hang out with each other. It is pretty funny. I think that everyone should meet new people. My friends tried out for the ORGNAME show. I don't know if they made it though. My time is up. I am very happy. 
__label__label0 Somehow I just submitted an blank assignment so hopefully this one will submit when it is completed. I should be studying for my first astronomy test right now. Somehow I managed to put it ORGNAMEf until the last minute like I did with this writing assignment. I need to break this procrastination problem before I get any further into the semester. I have this problem every fall that I have been in college. In spring I am fine I get everything done ahead of time. I am sure it has nothing to do with fall or spring. I am hoping this fall my grades will be awesome but it is hard adjusting to a new environment. I just transferred to LOCNAME after 0 years at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME. I have been living here now for almost three weeks. I feel like I'm on vacation or something. While I miss my old apartment and friends, I am very happy to be here at LOCNAME. I couldn't get in to UT directly after high school because of my class rank. I didn't really concern myself with school in high school. Suddenly when I started at ORGNAME academics became more important to me and my grades improved. I applied to UT expecting to not get accepted because I had heard horror stories of how hard it is to transfer in. It came as a complete surprise when my parents called and told me I got a letter of acceptance. I instantly decided that I was ready for the move. It never really hit me that I was leaving my friends behind in LOCNAME until now. I think I offended one of my closest friends in LOCNAME because I was so excited about moving and didn't really seem to care that I was leaving. Suddenly two weeks before I moved she decided irrationally that she never wanted to speak to me again. Oh well. I love Austin. 
__label__label1 Right now I'm a little bit depressed, not much has gone my way this week. I made some fabulous friends last week and we were all planning on going home together tomorrow, but now they seem not to want me to go with them. I don't know why everyone is getting mad all of the sudden, maybe it's something in the air. quite ridiculous, if you ask me. I have tears in my eyes as I'm typing, which is strange because I have tried so hard to not let little things get to me. My mom has always told me that I was overly sensitive, I thought I could overcome it, I think I can overcome anything. I had Mono a few years ago, and I overcame that one. My mind has not been forced to think in a while, people that I've talked to are just not to stimulating, I guess I should go and hang out in a coffee shop or something. I always thought college was going to be so much fun, and it's really not. I am this close to packing my bags and going home. Last week, I was the stereotypical college student and now, definitely not. My roommate and I are just not compatible, I mean she's a nice girl and all and she has good intentions, but I find her incredibly dull and childlike. She is a sophomore and I am a freshman. She has a really low self esteem and that's something that I don't deal well with, because I used to too. I don't like to think about those times, because I've overcome them. I fear that she is what I will become and it makes me resent her a bit. I don't want to live the life, or lack thereof, that she is leading. I make my life incredibly competitive, and I like to win. My cousin is down here, she rushed, she's actually in this class. But we've competed with each other all of our lives, whether the other one realized it or not, driving home, getting ready, meeting guys, they were all competitions. She and I are both incredibly stubborn too, so we butt heads quite often. I know that I've changed this year, and she has too, but we've changed differently. She's become more and more dependent on people, she can't be alone at all and I've become more and more independent of folks, for instance tonight, I walked over to the turtle pond and fed the fish, PROPNAME would freak out if someone told her to do that alone, but I really enjoyed myself tonight, I haven't felt that quiet peace in a long time down here. I don't know if LOCNAME is the right place for me, and I don't know. This is ridiculous. I'm here, and I'll graduate from here. Is this the sort of paper you're looking for? My mind is definitely not in a deep ponderous mood. This his how my mind works, worry after worry. I'd rather not get too far into myself here, if that's alright. On a happy note, I saw a guy in my Philosophy class today with absolutely Amazing hair. It was bleach blond and had four inch spikes! I admire people being gutsy enough to do that, never in my life would my hair be in spikes or fuchsia, I'll just stay the way I am. I miss my dog. I talked on the phone to my parents last night and I heard her bark in the background. I am ready to go home that's pretty much what has gotten me through this week. It has been the first time that I've gotten homesick. I think it's because I am going home tomorrow. Before, I didn't get homesick because I didn't allow myself to think about it too much, but I saw a LOCNAME Morning News today and got all choked up. What is all of this about anyway? Where do I benefit in the long run of living with someone I don't like and being forced to eat bad food? I'd much rather be in my own apartment. HA! My folks would really go for that one. They are so overprotective. The people that I was originally going home with are going to the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert, and my mom won't let me go, I'm also not allowed to go to the LOCNAME v. OU game. That is stinky! I just need a good cry and a good nap and a hug from my grandma and everything will be fabulous again. I swear! If my roommate asks one more time if I want to talk about anything that's bothering me I will scream. I told her already that I'm writing a paper and she is still jabbering. Okay, PROPNAME PROPNAME. Back to Grandma. She is the cutest old lady in the entire world. She is definitely a cookiecutter grandma. It's fabulous. I told her I was coming home and she got so excited! My twenty minutes are up, but I feel much better now, I'm glad I got to take all of my emotion out on this essay rather than on my roommate! I don't know quite how to end my thoughts, even though I am 00. 00% sure that no one will ever read this. 
__label__label1 Life, was is it. what can we humans get from it. Is it just something we experience and can't explain? but why do I think of this? no one tells me to do it I just to it. do I feel like I have the answers? maybe, maybe we all have the answer to what bothers us. can we decide when the hurting stops and when our happiness begins. I guess I'm trying to evaluate what is bothering me now. kind of strange, or is it? the think that is bothering me now is that someone else is going to read what I am placing down on this sheet. it doesn't seem fare for me to be doing this when no one else tells me what they think. so I'm giving my 0 cents for nothing, and to no one so I will think about something else. school. kind of fun yet very hard to do. what should I major in? I wanted to do something with math but now that kind of seems hard, money wise. I'm guess I'm just going to go for something that is easy for me to get now. then payback loans and go back for a math degree of some type. what to think of now. students in my classes seem strange this year. heck I seem a little strange this year. I've noticed that I have changed about the aspects of what my university has to offer. I can see why most people come to this school for, and guess what, not for the classes. I remember reading one year in a sociology class that the university can act as a marriage broker. I see this statement "seems" to be true now. is that why I came to this school, probably. I mean I could of stayed in my home town if I wanted just to go to college. would have been cheaper that way. also family had to do with it as well. older brother went here and got a bs in aerospace engineering. could this also explain my interest in the mathematics? and why do I seem to be self evaluating? should I just go with the flow and not worry about the future, past, or even the present? nah, I like to keep my ideas in sort "check. " now I'm remembering what my friend said about the ORGNAME religion and one of the guidelines in it. it basically said that if you get rid of desire, you will feel no pain. kind of an interesting statement. because it shows a whole set of values that you could change, and this would make you happy. now thinking of what my evolutionary biology teach once said. purpose of life is to pass your genes onward, sense genes are immortal. these two statements seem to conflict with each other. that funny. now beginning to think about what time it is. 0:00, only 0 more minutes to go for this rant. well, guess I can explain what I plan to do tomorrow. going to cal class and spark up a conversation with a member of the opposite sex. reasoning being is for "help" on the homework, just needed though. I should just do it and get it over with. that approach never works for me, but never say never right. it should be very simple to do if I get there on time this time. getting a little hungry now, but I will finish this, only have 0 more minutes anyways. damn just remembered an embracing moment in Deutschkurs (German class) freaking had a voice crack, och. hate speaking in front of others, don't know why. draws people to look at me I guess, and I'm not comfortable with that. has to do with a self esteem problem. am working on fixing that by making myself get use to attention. don't know if that is the right thing to do, maybe might learn something about it in this class. (one reason why I took the class, and sure for some people as well ) noticed the brackets I have been putting all over this. seems like my consciousness is explaining something to me. that a interjoke. oh times up. 
__label__label0      what classes do i take next semester?  i need to plan out the rest of my college coursres out today. can i do it?  is it too much for me?  i think i can do it. i am completely capable of being admitted into medical school. thus far, i know that that is what God has in store for me, and what he thinks I should do now. there are so many people out there that i want to reach out to and help. i can not wait until my missions trip to russia. it wil be an awesome experience. everytime i think of all the people and children I will be helping i get a warm, tender, and comforting feeling in my heart. i think that God has given the gift of helping and taking care of others. for an extended period of my life i have always tried to find the meaning of my life, what special characteristics i possess but now i do not ponder on those things. i know that God has blessed me with several things and I am truly grateful. i hope that i can get involved with a good church here, and find a really nice cell group to join. i miss houston, newlife, house church. i wish that i could have stayed in houston and went to school there but i believe that i am where i belong. even though i may not like it here, i know that it is for the best. i believe that i will receive the best education i need for my profession in the future. plus, who knows, I may get more involved in church here in austin, and that may be another reason God has brought me here. nevertheless, i am determined to work far and beyond to be able to do my job. i am so tired today. i feel very tired but i can not seem to go back to sleep. it seems like every second is precious and i do not waste it by sleeping, atleast during the day. i am so nervous. it is only the third day of school and i am already stressing out. i think that i need to lighten up a little. my sister is right. i worry about things too much. i should just be easy-going but not too easy-going, i do not want to be carefree about everything. i am very thankful that i have naeri and my sister here. since i do not know many people in austin, it helps to atleast have one or two people i can talk to once in a while. i want to meet new people but the people here seem too immature for me. i am not really into the clubbing, drinking, etc. but then again there are so many students here, and i have only met the people that are into that because the people that i know are, so i just tag along. i am pretty sure that i will meet numerous people that share the some interests and aspects as i do. but i do not mind being alone. i think i am pretty independent exept for the fact that my parents my tuition but other than that i feel pretty independent. and, i also work and communicate well with others.  
__label__label0 This is the second paper I have written like this because somehow the other one disappeared right when I was trying to push the   Finish   button. It seems like my life is always going the wrong way or I have bad luck such as this for most of the time. I did just get through working out with my   Tae-bo   tape. After completing that I always feel 000% better about myself and problems. I guess you could say that is how I deal with all of my stress,even though my life is not all that bad. Whenever someone thinks their life is terrible I always think about those children that you see on television that are starving or sick. I don't know why but I whenever I see a homeless person on the street I immediately feel sorry for them but then I start to think about why they don't have a job or are not in a shelter. My mind goes back and fourth like that a lot. LOCNAME has a lot of homeless and I am so not used to that atmosphere, that is partly why I don't like living here. And because my boyfriend wants me to come back closer to where he lives which is LOCNAME, where I live as well. I chose LOCNAME and UT because a lot of people told me that I should not go here, including my boyfriend. That just made me want to come even more though, dispite the fact that I could tell at orientation that I was not going to like it. My boyfriend is very important to me though because I have dated him for 0 years and we have a really special relationship. I can tell just by looking at him exactly what he is thinking about. I have never really had that with anyone before and he always tells me that he loves me. I find this kind of annoying because in my family I don't think that my mom or dad have ever told me those three words. My grandmother has but I used to just say it not even thinking about what it really meant. I guess that is why whenever he tells me that repeatably it starts to get on my nerves. Hopefully I don't have love issues or something of that nature because don't get me wrong I truly know that my parents love me but they just never told me. I have had a good life so I really don't need to complain about small things. I am in a very difficult spot in my life, college is a lot harder than most people say. I mean I expected the classes to be difficult and challenging but not the living on your own part. I was always so ready to get away from my house and away from the town that I lived in. Now I am not so sure about this because I don't really like Austin. I believe that I would have been better at a smaller school but I never really thought about those issues when I was selecting a college. I was too busy talking to or seeing my boyfriend or worrying about stupid high school bull that goes on everyday. I should have not cared where my best friend went to school, even though she was supposed to come here with me and then suddenly changed her mind without telling me. I am not resentful or anything but I feel that it is partly her fault, no it's not it is all my fault. I am the one who chose my future and now I want to change those plans. I guess I should be greatful that my roommate is not some freak with earrings and tattoos all over her body. I always think that things can always get worse and if you're lucky they sometimes get better. At least I did not get stuck in the same room as my suite mates because they are kind of snobbish. For instance, if I see them outside of our dorm then I have to say hi and if I don't they pretend they don't know me. I don't understand why people are like that but who am I to make a judgement, for all I know they are really sincere and nice people. I talk about people way too much but if you do it for so long it just comes natural and you can't stop. My room is actually really comfortable right now, usually it is either way hot or real cold.         
__label__label0      Well I am sitting in my apartment thinking how weird it is to live by myself with out a roomate. I stair at my fish, and don't know many of my neighbors since I am new to the LOCNAME area. My room is a mess, I am a total slob and hate to admit that. However, I would clean it up if I had a guest or to. But not during the week me and my friends are busy doing homework and trying to inteact with orginizations around the LOCNAME campus. I still miss my dance at LOCNAME. I worked so hard for that team and myself finally made friends in that little town. I am happy to be at a new school though for a new fresh start. Tryouts for the UT dance team are on thursday and I am debating back and forth if I will make it and how bad I really want it. I know for a fact I really want that spot on the dance team it would be a complete honor. But then again I have this attitude that if I don't care the dissapointment will not hurt as bad if I don't get the spot. I am just so use to being on a dance team and belonging to a group. Everyone knows me as the dancer. so what am I now if I don't make the dance team?  I actually miss home its been about a month and a half since I have seen my parents and I miss my 0 cats soo bad!  I miss my ex boyfriend terribly and wish I could see although he is 0 and 0/0 hrs away at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I miss those hugs he would give everyday even when we were friends they honestly made me feel good inside. I am acutally quite bothered that my boyfriend won't call me back. I haven't seen him in 0 days and just wanted to see him for a little while. Everytime I ask him if I can see him and have to ask still after 0 months of going out he always answers with a I don't know. I feel like I need a lot of attention and hurts my feelings when he seriously does that. Not allowed to hang out with my best guy friend because these two don't get along however I don't agree with that and hang out with him anyways. I don't feel as I have to clear everything with him. I am happy that I have my two best friends here though quite close on campus. One my bestfriend from highschool didn't see much of eachother there for a while because I went away to school for 0 years and she stayed home. PROPNAME and me have been roomates for 0 years in a tiny dorm room and decided that we wanted to live by ourselves for a change. I actually enjoy it and can do as I please. I am aslo worried about finding study buddys for my classes because I am sure my grades will be better if I study with others. Its hard to just start talking to people. when I am new I can be a bit shy. But once you get to know me I am a quite talkative person full of energy but people don't know that unless they approach me. I need to dye my hair red again becuase my mousy brown hair is starting to show again and I hate it. . glad I don't have to go to work today becaue i have soo much to do this week. I should really clean up my apartment because I have a major ant problem going on here especially in the kitchen. Its one of my best friends birthday's today I called her up and shes going out tonight wish I was here but I'm not in LOCNAME. Wish I could be home. My dad just lost his job but has been wanting to leave for awhile. And does have a back up he has his own business called    ORGNAME ORGNAME  . Now I am glad he can dedicate all he can to his dreams which is having a successful business of his own. I am worried about him though he has been very stressed out latley. I need to call T. C to get help with my homework. . I will pass that darn T. A. S. P test soon! I don't have any other choice I am eager to get out of math and graduate college.  
__label__label1  I sure am glad to get this out of the way. I really enjoy all of my new classes but by math Professor is really hard to understand. I miss PROPNAME so much and ca not wait until this weekend when I get to see her. This typing stuff and I don't get along very well but thatÕs why I have voice activated word processor. I talk and it types everything that I pronounce. I really don't think that fifteen hours on the first semester of school was a very good idea. I have absolutely no free time. I have PHL, PSY and ORGNAME so I am reading all the time. At least I have a few good friends in most of my classes. I need to get my head back in school though because right now it is still in summer. All the information I receive in lectures simply goes in one ear and out the other. I hope my Mom is doing better. I left her alone all by herself when I moved to college. Wow, this is a really elementary level paragraph,   Ehh, O well.   So I wonder if its true that guys can blank out and be thinking about nothing, no literally nothing and girls always have thoughts flying through their heads. If itÕs true the girls papers should be some what longer than the guys unless of course the girl cannot type very well (like me). I really wish I could decide on a major soon but if not I know everything will be just fine. The only thing I would like to have more of is free time. I have no free time to get my mind off of the books. Hopefully that will come soon. IÕm getting pretty tired of riding the capital metro to and from school I really need to see about a dorm room for next semester but for sure next year. I feel like I am writing diary or something, actually it's quite relaxing and stress relieving. I need to see about going to my chem. and math's professorÕs office hours. Well IÕm thinking so hard on what to write about that I am drawing a blank, I think its the small amount of sleep I have been acquiring. I wonder if my cars AC will be fixed tomorrow like they said but then again they said it would be today and I'm still with out a car. It's very hard not to use   IM   language on this and abbreviate everything. By the way I suck at spelling so sorry if anyone reads this other than me. I wonder what all the goop is inside my lava lamp is made of?  I don't know but I do know that my Chem. professor wouldn't know because he have a hard enough time trying to teach my class of 000 the chemistry basics. Sweet it's already over, man that was fast, too bad it's not like that in class. 
__label__label0      So I just read the asterix at the bottom of the screen about your social security number and it sounded like the most rediculous thing EVER!  I mean, obviously you don't want you SSN to be taken, but if youre telling PROPNAME you have to speak quietly?!  So no one overhears you?!  What the hell?  I read it out loud to my roommate and good friend from high school, PROPNAME and she said it was probably serious because our freshman English teacher in high school got her social security number stolen. I was sick this morning and I skipped all my classes. I don't know if I should write that because now maybe you think I'm a slacker. But I really felt like complete shit. I did go out last night til like 0,  but I'm really snotty and coughing up phlegm. So last night when I got home, I had to walk home early because PROPNAME felt like way faint and was supertired and her face was white-it was weird. So we came back and I was a little drunk and I called my ex from high school, but he's still my best friend and we talk all the time, PROPNAME. It was so funny, he answered the phone- I was really surprised because he sleeps like a log, but he answered and sounded kind of awake so I asked him if i woke him up and he said no he was about to take a nap though. But I'm sure he was woken up. I really like him and I think I'll probably end up with him someday just because I can't picture ever having a friend I can confide in as much as him and I feel like he knows me inside and out-however cheesy that may seem. But I still get elated when he calls me and I love talking to him most of the time. I'm really excited because tonite I'm going to KA pledge line!  with one of my friends from high school, PROPNAME, a KA pledge. I can't decide if i should wear this black tube dress with a white ribbon on it or this black mock turtleneck dress thats a little bit longer and supertight. Its very flattering, but it seems like guys always like strapless stuff and I have to wear my superhigh heeled shoes with the mock turtleneck dress and a lot of guys like petite girls. I might go with that one anyway though because I have like a zit on my chest and it shows with the tube one. But I've met PROPNAME PROPNAME a few times and I'm way starstruck with him and want to go on a date with him really bad just so I can say I could kind of, and he's kind of short. But I have a crush on this pothead (of course)  I'm always attracted to that type (except PROPNAME) who's tall and his name is PROPNAME. I may just forget about PROPNAME and go for the tall shoes. haha. So I've only been writing for 00 minutes 00 seconds!  I have so much time left and I already feel like the most shallow girl ever- not to mention slacker for skipping class already. PROPNAME, my suite mate and I are going to go to the ORGNAME later and then-shopping!!  You can never be too sick to shop. So right now I'm undeclared liberal arts and I was thinking about transferring to the business school and then I was like what the hell am I doing because I hate math and economics!  So I dropped economics and added art history which I do like and decided to just stick with calculus-unfortunately. I got a 00 on my calculus homework yesterday. great a C already, that sucks ass. But I'm taking textiles-which sounds like another crap course but I'm really interested in fashion merchandising as a major. I want to be a buyer when I grow up or own a cute little clothes store. I think that would be a blast. But I told my dad I was taking textiles and he laughed his ass off for like 00 minutes and I mentioned fashion merchandising (but not like I was going to do it) and he would absolutely die and disown me if I majored in that. he was like you can still major in English and be a buyer. But I know he's going to tell the whole family I'm taking textiles and theyre all going to laugh at me and think I'm dumb, but whatever. Textiles really is harder than some of my other classes like French (that you would think would be a really hard class). We have to memorize like 000 different kinds of fabrics and their properties. Yikes. So I'm like aching right now and I really think I have LOCNAME LOCNAME. PROPNAME's brother's friend (in LOCNAME LOCNAME) had to have his appendix out because they thought it was appendicitis, but he really had LOCNAME LOCNAME. How much does that suck?!  So I like UT ok right now, but from what I've heard everyone saying about the college experience being the best thing ever, I don't know so much right now. I can't imagine ever having friends as close as the ones I had in high school or meeting people as nice as the ones in LOCNAME LOCNAME. LOCNAME people seem way nicer to me than LOCNAME people. 
__label__label1      I am feeling sad but feeling so much better. Yesterday was hopeless, today there is hope. I am realizing that I am so much more complete without my boyfriend than I was with him. Next time I will not let someone control my thoughts and actions so completely. Next time I will not let myself make excuses for someone. I have learned a lot. I feel like I want to kiss him so bad, to feel his lips on mine, to feel his skin on mine. I want him to hold me all night and tell me everything is all right. But in my heart I know it is. It is so hard to be his friend but I want to so much. He says he doesn't want to lose me. It is funny, we see each other more often now that we are just friends. And no that is not friends with benefits. There is no way I would let him take advantage of me like that. . but it would be so much fun. Then it would hurt so much. It's really not hard to be with him, I love being with him. The hard part is leaving him. Every time I do I feel like I may never see him again. He hugs me and says it will be ok, babe, I promise. I know he is right, it will. I just wish it was going to be like I thought it was going to be. I had such big plans for this fall. After waiting on him all summer, who could blame me?  He seemed so perfect for me last May. What happened?  I need to stop asking myself these questions and move on with my life, I know that. But being his friend and seeing him all the time is going to make that more difficult. I am just trying to be as sweet as possible and show that there are no hard feelings. I really am not mad at him; I just wish I could change the way he felt. Alright, that is not really true. The truth is, I wish he was a different person. I wish he was the person I imagined he was and truly believed he was all summer. Instead, I fell in love with a commitment-phobic guy who drinks to much and actually owns a rifle. I can't believe I could be so stupid. He looks so sweet and innocent. I am moving on though. Or I will be shortly. I just need to dwell for a little longer. Like I said, there is hope today. I know I am beautiful and intelligent and witty and sweet, I don't need him to tell me that. I just wish I had someone who would. I am trying so hard to be independent but I have never really had a significant other I could depend on so I guess it's not that hard. I guess I am just in love with the idea of being in love. I want to be swept off my feet. I just hope I'm not infected with that crazy disease where I can only love people who don't love me back because I want to make people love me. I really hope I don't push people away. I try so hard to be a good girlfriend but when someone doesn't call you when he says he's going to and leaves you hanging a million times, what are you supposed to do besides get upset and threaten to break up with them?  I definitely put up with his shit for way too long. I know he will be a better friend than a boyfriend. It will just be so hard if I have to see him or hear about him with someone else. Especially if that someone else happens to be his ex-girlfriend. She tried to get back together with him this summer when I was 0 hours away. What a bitch, I can't believe she would do that. I hope he isn't still in love with her. Oh well, there is nothing I could do about that anyway. Didn't I say there was hope today?  Well, there is:  for the first time in days, I actually felt hungry. It felt so good to eat and not feel like I was going to throw up. It also felt good to not burst into tears every five minutes. Yeah, there were a few times when I would have liked to, but I think I did alright today. After all it has been only a little over 00 hours since he made his decision. I am doing very well, I think. I think it is helping that he wants to be my friend. When I told him I didn't know because it would be hard, he begged me, saying,   Please try, I don't want to lose you.   I am glad he did that because I don't want to lose him either. Even if he is all wrong for me, at least he can be there as a friend for me. He says he might want a relationship with me eventually but I don't want to wait for him. I can't. It would end up making me more miserable than ever. I think I am better off just going on with my life and talking to him only as a friend. I think the more I see him the more I will realize how wrong he is for me. I need someone who will put me before his buddies and who will love me with everything he has. I need someone who is ready to make a committment to me. I need someone who will send me flowers just because he is thinking about me. I need a fairytale romance, I need to be swept off my feet, I need love, real love, crazy love. Like all the songs, all the cliches, that is what I want more than anything. And I don't even know if I believe it exists. I want to, but c'mon folks, let's be realistic. Somehow my parents still manage to love each other but there is not really much passion there, at least that I am aware of. Maybe there is, but I doubt it. If true love is more than just a friendship, that means it involves chemistry and passion, but that stuff fades, it always fades. So what is to separate a strong, passionate friendship with true love?  Fucked if I know. All I know is, things are really looking up for me now. I'm going to be just fine. :) 
__label__label0      The room seems to be nice and cool, much better than the heat outside. I should keep in mind that in thirty minutes or so I will go to a study group. I'm kind of hungry, i don't know what I should get for dinner today. Should I go for sushi or pasta, why am I so indecisive?  I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I hate it when I don't know what to write, or when I have a blank moment. I should remember to check if there are any conflicting exam times with my biology class exam. What is it that makes people tick?  As soon as I find the time to, I'm going to read Lord of The Rings. Maybe i shouldn't get sushi because its too expensive, but its also so good. There goes my indecisiveness again. I wonder which song I should listen to next, what am I in the mood for. This song sounds good, I guess I'll stick with this one for a while until I get bored of it. Is there any other homework left, I hate it whenever I get the feeling that I'm forgetting something but can't seem to find out what. It might be a good idea to do laundry this weekend, but i'll probably get lazy again, must remind myself not to be lazy. Maybe I should call my study partner that I might be late in coming because of thi essay. I'll turn around for a while and see what my roommate is watching on TV. I wonder if the music that I'm playing bugs my roommate or not. The TV show thats on right now seems pretty funny. I've never had Mountain Dew: Code Red before, maybe I should try it sometime, that is as soon as they restock the coke machines in my dorm. What is the point of life? All we do is try to become someone who has a purpose in society, and then in the end it doesn't even matter cause we all eventually die. I wonder what it would be like if I could be immortal. Many seems to think that being immortal is a curse cause you'll go through a lot of pain and it'll never end, I on the other hand find it interesting. I hope I can get a high GPA and keep it, it would really be nice if something academic turned out perfectly the way I wanted it to. I still kind of mad at the chemistry online homework, how could I be so stupid as to make such stupid mistakes. Oh well I can make it up on the next homework. I better do good on the exam, cause this is supposed to be easy for me since I've done it all already.   
__label__label0    Today is September 00, the day before our new monumental rememberence day ORGNAME September 00th. I sometimes wonder if tomorrow there will be another attack on the LOCNAME LOCNAME. It is weird to think that anything could happen tomorrow and we can't do anything about it. I still remember like it was yesterday watching the September 00th terrorist attack not knowing what will happen to the LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really hope that we can prevent anything from happening tomorrow.        Now that I am a freshman at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME things are beginging to change. For instance, my boyfriend and I are on a   break  , whatever that means. He doesn't like me only seeing him when it is convinient for me to hang out. He's a junior at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and has done the whole new college experience already. It is hard for him to not see me as much as this summer. I think it is that I really want to go out and meet new people. Getting to know the girls at my dorm in Kinsolving is really fun, and I like hanging out with them on the weekends. Of course this means going to parties with other boys there, and this doesn't make my boyfriend very happy. I can totally understand because I wouldnt want him to hang out with all girls at a party, but I have to do the whole college experience right?  Well anyway now that we are broken up, I realize how much I miss him and how much I don't want to end things. It's weird how when it's time to go to sleep or study that is all I can think about. He's so cute and perfect, I don't know what I am screwing up. It's hard trying to balance your time here now that I am in college. There is always something to do, and I love that, but I need to concentrate on studying and keeping myself on track. I guess in high school that courses could be made not as difficult, and deadlines were not so final, as long as you could persuade the teacher. College is a blast and I love my roomate. She went to high school with me until our junior year when she moved to LOCNAME LOCNAME. She still came down lots during the last two years of high school to visit her old friends every chance she could. So then she made the right choice and came to LOCNAME and we ended up rooming together. It's really fun because last night we decided we wanted to work out at the gym downstairs to take a break from studying and went to kinsolvings gym for an hour from 0 in the morning to 0 in the morning. I really need to go to the gym today also because I don't want to gain the freshman 00, I reallly don't want to go back home to LOCNAME LOCNAME looking like a heffer!  So anyway I think I might go run after I finish writing. Another hard thing about being off at school is that my best friend in the world is not here. She got in to the summer LOCNAME program but decided to go to ORGNAME instead. I miss her so much, we spent every second toghther this summer and are so close. OUr boyfriends are best friends so the four of us hung out all the time. Me and my boyfriend were responsible for hooking them up, so we could all hang out and it worked perfectly. Except now we're having problems and we're in the same town. My friend and her boyfriend are 0 hours away and doing great, funny how that works. One good thing about going to school here in austin is that it is so pretty. I love the hills and trees. OUtside my dorm room window is hills and churches. Yes, it is hot here but it doesnt have the humididty that we had back home. Another good thing about living here is that my older sister that is 00 goes to ORGNAME so is only like 00 minutes away from me. We have always been so close and I miss her lots. I went down on Laybor day with 0 of my friends to go float the river with her and her sorority sisters. It was really fun and I got to spend time with her. My mom is sad that I left for college, she wanted me to stay at home for the first year and go to a jr college. I really wanted to get out on my own and not have to stay at home and be left behind. All of my friends were leaving for school and I really didnt wnat to be the only one at home. I am one out of four kids at home. MY older sister is already off at ORGNAME, but then I have a 00 year old brother and a 00 year old sister. I don't think it is the same at home without me. My mom and I  are really close, and I talk to her almost everyday. She said it's very quiet without me at home, I guess I was always the busy one and needing to do stuff and rush around. Even though not being at home is very weird, I love college. The freedom you have is great. I know that I have to concentrate on my classes lots because I want to get into the communications school here at UT&gt; 
__label__label1 I just got up about twenty minutes ago and really thought that I should finish this assignment, I felt kind of embarrased the other day when the entire class had done theirs' and I was still sitting around without twenty minutes to spare. I really am kind of overwhelmed by the class and university in general, not that I've told anyone because that's just not how I deal with my problems. I scheduled my classes so that I have these breaks in between that I could presumably use to study, but I instead retire to my dorm room to eat macaroni and watch a movie. I watch too many movies in the first place (I'm a theater major, so it's basically study), but I haven't placed any amount of time into actual studying for classes like biology that I know I have trouble with. Between that and the massive theater program, it's just a bit too much. Here I am, now the tiny fish in the pond when I've spend the last four years on top of the game as far as acting was concerned. It's just a different place, different circumstances, and I just don't know where I fit in yet. I understand that I have to learn the ropes and pay my dues and then eventually I'll be on top (best case scenario anyway). But what will I do if this really isn't the path best meant for me? I really, honestly don't think I'd be able to survive in a desk job for the rest of my working life, and if I don't make it as an actor, chances are, that's exactly what I'll have to do. That prospect terrifies me even more than the class thing, or I guess goes along with it, because to even have a chance at success in the entertainment industry I have to have a broad range of intelligences not only within the field, but general knowhow as well, so I'm back to the first worry. It just seems like it's never good enough, I went to junior high in LOCNAME where I was the smartest kid in the school, the guy everybody and their dog went to for the answer, I come to LOCNAME and suddenly, I'm not the best anymore. Which was alright with me, it unloaded that pressure, blah, blah, but I lost my initiative to try harder than everybody else to get the grade. Since then, my identity has been kind of in the in-between realm, I have intelligence, I was in the top 00 percent of my class, but most of the actual retained knowledge I have from  high school is pop-culture trivia, but I think I could still hold my own on Jeopardy. That is something that made me feel better about college, about a week before I came here, they were showing the Jeopardy college championships, most participants hailing from the LOCNAME LOCNAME, or whatever, and I just tore them apart, even in stuff like Chemistry which I had thought was long gone from my memory after sophomore year, who knew? So I guess I feel alright about classes in the end, maybe it's just because I feel so boring just hanging in my room all the time and don't really feel a part of the student body. I'm sure it'll happen sooner or later, but like most occurances in the history of man, it's over a girl. Long distance relationships are really hard, and here I am trying to pull one off in freshman year, it's going great so far, and I guess it says something that going out and partying runs a distant second to a five minute phone conversation with her, but it's just not helping me become a Longhorn. I love her to death, I really do, so I just haven't worried about it, I figured that it'd work itself out, and I think it still will. Adjustment is hard, especially such an immense one. Gah, college. I've started to believe that there's a soundtrack to life, I guess we'll probably cover that with the psych TA at some point in time, but seriously. Depending on what's going on in my life, I have certain predelections to what kinds of music, and specific songs I listen to, and I guess it's beyond obvious that it has some psychological base, but it's all the time now. I have PROPNAME PROPNAME's   Secret Garden   running through my head right now, most likely because I just started thinking about my girlfriend a while back, which made me think of the times we've spent together, and for some reason bringing about the two of us sitting and watching PROPNAME PROPNAME and remembering PROPNAME from the soundtrack and noticing the correlation of the lyrics with my feelings for this girl. It probably wasn't very smart to have done this this morning, I don't feel like my thoughts are in order. It's the morning of September 00th, I just realized. I'm not worried though, I have faith in this country, I have faith in my own ideals of freedom and life and soforth. Bring em on. If they attack again, I really don't think we can stop them, and it'll suck having more American lives lost, but they can't tear down who we are. There's my bit of patriotism, just thought it appropriate given the day, but my twenty minutes are up, so I'm damming the stream. 
__label__label0      Im tired and i need to wake up tomorrow for my eight o' clock class. . i should probably go to bed.

__label__label1      I just came back from the LOCNAME Crew Meeting. I sort of want to try out but in the same time very scared. At the meeting, they kept on saying there'll be a lot of hard work and pain. First of all, I don't think I'm in that great of a shape to do such extreme rowing. The crew memebers said it doesn't matter because they will train you from nothing to something. Second of all, I'm a freshman and doing Pre-Pharmacy. I want a good GPA to start off of. I don't know how I'm going to adjust to waking 0 o'clock in the morning. I guess one of the reason I wanted to join is because to challenge myself and make some new friends. More than 000 people from my graduating class comes to ORGNAME now. Before school ended, I got very tired of many of the people. I felt they were very fake. I came to UT hoping to make some friends. I still wanted to keep my old friends though. I truly love them. They mean so much to me. What I'm trying to say is that it's hard to find friendships like that. Everyone on my floor seems nice. They smile at me and everything but it seems like they are always in a rush. Everyone has their own things to do and no time to hang out. Anyways, I'm watching American Idol right now and they just announced that PROPNAME as the American Idol. I never thought the show would be such a hit. ORGNAME used to have this show called Pop Star. Not that many people watched it so I wasn't expecting a great rating for this show. The time is almost up so I guess that is it for today. It was very nice writing.  
__label__label0        tj just got home and made his coffee. It smells good. I should have made coffee instead of drinking 0 cupsof Earl Gray tea because after two cups I have to pee every 00 to 00 minutes. Is it going to flood again. Looks like it is going to rain more. Ihope the tropical depression doesnt stall causing flooding again. We were sooo close last Nov. Itis about time for a nap. all this reading to do toady. That has to be completed today. My school schedule sucks. My work schedule sucks. Added together = triple sucking. I have NO reading time. I need to settle mom's affairs to that I don't have towork this semester. PROPNAME will help me if the probate isnt over. He is truely manic depressive. His birthday upsetting him so he bought his 00 inch TV and now after the LOCNAME LOCNAME deseaster his new Mercedes. Could it be from his Zoloft that he is taking for his premeture ejaculation condition?  If your mental state is fine and you takean anti depressant for a medical condition (non mental), can that cause a mental condition itself?  Was he trueful with me on the ture purpose for taking Zoloft?  Or, is he a scheemer?  The plane flying over triggered my thought that I can't beleive that it has already been a year since that traumatizing pictures on TV of 0-00. I have to pee already but I can't since this is timed. But I need to really badly, now that I thought of it. Dinner. What shall I make?  Should I save my time and just order Pizza?  I hope that my wallet that was stolen in New orleans arrives Monday. I hope that the receipts that I need to return those books are still in it. I am soo thankful that there are still good, honest people left in this world and that one found my wallet. He said that there was no money in it but what other stuff that was in the bill compartment is still there. I need to send that guy something as a thank you for your trouble to send it back to me. What should I send him?  Money for the acutal cost of sending my wallet to me and maybe a gift certificate, but from where?  I was soooo careful, making sure that my back pocket was buttoned at ALL times, almost like an obsession - constantly checking the button. PROPNAME learned though, don't have your , never mind, strangers shouldn't have to read that thought. I hope nothing is wrong with my niece. I hope that she is not upset that I couldn't chat with her while typing this. Only 0 more minutes left. my laundy is ready to be taken out of the dryer. 0 minutes left to keep typing. I may have to restart the dryer to keep my clothes from wrinkeling. Why did I stop ironing all my clothes all the time. But it feels soooo good to not worry about little stuff like that anymore. I am pleased with the present me; although it is a VERY differnt me. Overall, I am pleased with the present. Getting over Moms death is comming along nicely. Still have my mommy moments though. I guess I always will. Im just glad that the urge to call her every sunday, like I have for years, has stopped. That was VERY irritating every sunday not getting to hear her voice. I miss her. But, thats the consiquence of love. Losing them one day. But man, the number of people that I have lost is astonishing. Damn you PROPNAME!!! so many deaths on your shoulder. 
__label__label1      So right now I'm trying to hold myself together. I have so much on my mind that its actually a relief to do this assignment even though its holding my back from a deadline. I recently tryed out for LOCNAME Sirits and shockingly I made the first cut. Wow, out of 000 girls I was one of the eighty to be chosen. THe bad news is that I have to do another   creative   project which equals time and money, two things that are in low supply right now. I hate money. People always say,   money can't by you happiness    but I beg to differ. If you have money then you don't have to worry about finding a place you can afford that isnt 00 miles away from campus, or where you're next meal is comming from. It really is the little things for me though. I would like that extra size ice-cream. or another UT t-shirt. However, Mr. PROPNAME steps in {A good friend of my dads} and prevents me from enjoying the extra   perks   of life. I'm sure I'll look back some day and laugh or maybe this is just one of those challenges in a certain stage of our lives life. Maybe if all the college kids were well off it would disrupt the order of the world. Ramen Noddeles would go out of bussines. ORGNAME ORGNAME would close down. And sadly second hand stores would be no more. Wow i really need to finish my project! Its due in a couple of min. I feel like I'm allways rushing around. My life is one big traffic jam. How is this? maybe I take on too much. But other people take on just as much if not more and they seem in control. I wonder if people think I'm in control? Ha that would be the greatest prank of the decade! OK is ths almost over cause i really got to go. . yes almost.   
__label__label1      So, I'm supposed to be wtiting something. hmmm, looks like blank for now. that lady at the library help desk is really talking fast, or maybe i'm. i can't believe my sister didn't call me back, we were supposed to go grocery shopping. i keep hitting the back slash butten and then i have to stop and delete it. la dee da. biology note. now that woman can talk fast. she's just out of school too. and she has a good job. hope i can find a good job once i get out of school, of course that first means that i have to get out of school . when ever that is. nice pants. actually never, i don't really like heather grey. my mom always says that makes me look washed out. whatever that means. blank. another blank. i hope that the timer on this computer doesn't go out berfore the writing assignment timer goes out. writing assignment. library online. i have so much work to do. . wendy's that's sounds goood. i;m wearing a lot of blue. i always wear a lot of blue. . blue pen, blue spiral, blue notepad, blue mouse pad, even the E for internet explorer is blue. too much blue. hmmmmmmmm. keep writing don't stop. this will be jam packed. oh yeah. i wonder what tthis is for too. oops mispelled this. should i go back and change it. ha ha , when i type i saay everything so slowly. at least i haven't mispelled more words. finally got my bracelet back. PROPNAME. that was wierd seeing him again. what was even more wierd was seeing him wearing my bracelet. jerk off. oh, i wonder if it ws okay for me to   say   jerk off in this writing assignment, oh well, too late. finish button. can't wait to click on you. i crack my knuckles a lot. i hope i don't get arthritis. that would be a nice addition to the collection of future annoyances. hey that guy ws kind of cute. never mind! he turned around. mark is cute. yes he is. i wish he would call me back, but he's busy at work. raaaaaaaarrrrr. wait a second. has it been twenty minutes. am i supposed to keep track of the twenty minutes or does the computer automatically cut you off after twenty minutes? it's got to have been more than 00 minutes. at  least. i wonder why he said   set the right key    set the right key to what?  right, right.    
__label__label1      What I felt for last few weeks was depression as I do today. I have been depressed for several reasons such as adopting to the new environment, meeting new people, and keeping up with all the works that I have never done before. This writing assignment is another thing that makes my feeling depressed. My hands are getting sweat, I feel my face burning, and I can even hear my heart beating so loud. Since the time I started to write anything, I always had fear of writing. Actually I am not a good writer and writing makes my feeling very nervous. More than that, my boy friend is about to call me, and I really hope he would not call me until I finish writing this since I only got 00 minutes to do this. Well, even though he calls me, I don't think I will answer it, then call him back later and yell at him. Also I hope grammer and spelling mistakes won't be counted off from this type of writing. Now iI just touched my nose, and smelled cigarette on my finger. I am storongly thinking that I should quit smoking, which I am trying very hard to do. But this moment, I feel like to smoke really bad. Smoking always help me getting calm down. I feel totally lonely here, people are talking to each other, and they look like they all got their own friends. I am totally alone here, writing this paper. I felt lonely since I started to live alone. This is my first time to live myself, and whenever I try to sleep at night, I just feel some fear. I do not know what exactly that is. I just can't briefly breath, and now I feel same thing as writing this paper. I think my fear about dark and death started since I was in 0th grade. Because of my mom and dad who both had jobs, I had to live with my grandmother. Worse than that, I read a book called   I didn't belive recarnation  -well, actually something like that, when I was in 0th grade. That influenced me a lot in bad ways- fearing dark, and death. I am not actually scared of death at this moment since it is bright outside, but I feel similar fear right now. Now my hands are getting worse, and my fingers are sliding on the keyboard, and I really don't like that since this computer already has bad keyboard which is very hard to type on. I was not sure if I wanted to do this writing today since there were so many bad thing happened today- internet at home started not to work, I got a bad computer in communication building, and just this moment I pushed wrong key and keyboard did not work for last few minutes. I think I get very easily distractive since I am keep looking at someone else's sreen to see what he is doing on the internet. Anyways, it is such great experience that made me almost cry, and now I will count off ten until this page shuts down. Is it usual that I don't remember what I listed up there? Well. its been over 00 minutes, but it says I can keep writing. But I am not going to write any more since it is promise between the direction and me. Hope I am a few of people who are honest. 
__label__label0      yeah so i really don't want to be doing this but oh well. i really actually enjoy the psych class though sometimes i wonder how exactly anyone can figure out what a person is thinking. who came up with those experiments in the first place. im so relaxed right now cause i just got back from having a one hour massage. it was kind of weird at first cause i had never had one before but after like 00 min i was asleep. i so needed a massage, and i always seem to be tired even though i feel i get plenty of sleep. i don't think im typing as fast as i should be because there is this little voice saying you mispelled a word, go back and correct it. i guess that means i don't know if im actually completing the exercise correctly. but he never did list whether things had to be grammarically correct. i feel that im like this never ending jutebox that won't stop talking. right now im typing like those really annoying people that you never want to listen to that you are just like SHUT UP. haha. yeah so i have alot of stuff on my mind lately. i would like to actually call this my vent session because i have all this stuff in my mind thats just really been bugging me and i can't tell anyone because my best friend is so far up my roommates butt, because they are boyfriend and girlfriend, that i can say how i REALLY feel. my roommate can be such a jerk sometimes. and he does the stupidest things that just totally piss me off. like this one time i got back home from houston and he was like its your turn to buy the groceries. but i was the one that bought eighty-eight dollars in food when he only bought thirty. he was like well I've finally caught up with you now and I've spent one hundred and eighty. and im thinking, well jeez im sorry to put you out but i barely ever eat. i swear he eats like there is no tomorrow and i think that I've narrowed it down to how many times he eats a day. like 0!  it just really pisses me off. and he tells ME how i do nothing. im not the one who has tuesday and thursday off. not only that he sleep all freakin day. hes SO LAZY. i just want to say to him, hey im not the one that spends 00 freakin dollars on the lunch meat you pick out and watch them cut. come on and give me a freakin break. on top of the whole grocery issue, my parents have ME on a strict budget and so i can't spend all that much money. he goes out and buys a three hundred dollar tv because he feels like it. what can you say to that. his dad is working his butt off to pay for all the crap my roommate uses. dang the phone is ringing now and i can't concentrate anymore on what i was saying. anyways. yeah so i just want to be like, why don't you get off your lazy, pardon my language ass, and get a freakin job and stop mooching off of all your daddy's money. its not like his parents are rich either, he just thinks he is. on top of that he is sooo vain. everything on him and around him is so perfect. sometimes i wonder if hes a girl at heart or if he just LOVES looking at himself in the mirror.   god if only i was brave enough to tell him how i really feel. it wouldn't be so bad except for the fact is that its my freaking apartment too and my best friend, though i love her to death, is living with us. its like nightmare that never ends. you know those feelings when you are a third wheel and you just want to get the hell out? can you imagine it like 00/0. its horrible. it just makes you want to crawl in a hole and die. come on i pay for the freaking apartment the least she could do is STOP mooching off of us and possibly go home?  jeez.  on the topic of being a third wheel. i have this issue with two guys. im seeing this guy in houston that i like alot since my last boyfriend who totally broke my heart. lets say the guy im dating now is bob, and my ex is paul. so bob is like so sweet and hes alot older than me and i miss him a whole lot. at the same time paul who NOW goes to school with me, the reason we broke up is a long story, well we are becoming good friends. i never expected the thing with bob to actually happen over the summer and so now i have this like guy who i don't know exactly what we are but is considered a long distance relationship. bob has been nothing but sweet to me and i love him,  actually wait another thing he doesn't want me to tell him that i love him either. i mean maybe i do and maybe i don't. so yeah, me and paul have become best friends again after our whole breakup and his cheating on me with the girlfriend he had, but then calling me to tell me two weeks before school started back up that he had broken up with her. come on now, i haven't talken to paul in like forever then he calls me to tell me hes broken up with his girl friend. strange yes. but I've told myself that I've gotten over with him after being his girlfriend for two and half years. thats a long time to spend on one person. so yeah he came over yesterday to hang out with me while i was waiting for the time warner roadrunner dudes to come over and me and paul started watching a movie together. he started getting closer and closer to me but i was like woah arent we just friends. so i get up to get a drink, come back to my room and lay down on my bed. paul sits on my back and starts giving me a   friendly back massage   and all the while i was thinking that i really miss him and that i wouldn't mind getting back together with him. at this time bob hadn't called me since sunday night and i was getting really worried. so i started relaxing and having a good ole time with paul. later that night bob calls and hes like hey sweetie, i miss you and im sorry i haven't called you but I've been really busy and i tried sending you and email but it didn't work. yeah so now im caught in this situation that i can't seem to get out of or fig ure out. should i go after my ex that is here in austin. or should i go after bob whose been nothing but sweet to me, but is back home. i don't know what  i should do. and on top of all of this im sorta lonely, and i have alot of school work to take care and if i WANT a social life that not only that i can't seem to find ,and i have to work. i think that im slowly going insaine and this is too much things to think about for a person at my age. woah so yeah im going to stop now cause I've actually typed past the twenty min but i kind of feel better though 
__label__label0 Right now I am thinking about September 00th because i just got out of music class, and we discussed the emotional impact that music has on people. I never really thought about how emotional some songs make me feel. When my music teacher played   Amazing Grace   after reading an e-mail from a LOCNAME LOCNAME firefighter, I felt myself get teary eyed. It has been about 00 minutes since I've been in his class, and I still have that heart ache feeling thinking about the diffrent songs he played for the class. I also feel homesick. I keep thinking how i want to spend the anniversary of September 00th at home with my mom and dad. I am already homesick, and Wednesday is just going to intinsify my home sickness. I feel worried about my school work. I have so much homework that i need to get done that I'm starting to feel stressed out. I wish i would have study more these past two weeks instead of leaving the huge load I have now to the last minute. I don't think I'm ever going to catch up! I am really worried about Biology. It's an advanced class, and I have no idea what I'm doing in there. I still have an 00 paged packet that I must have done tomorrow. It's too hard though. I really wanted to go workout, but I don't feel like I have time. I want to go tanning but I have class at 0:00 and I needed to study inbetween my classes. I am really hungry. I want some buffalo wings. I think after I'm done typing this I'm going to order some Pluckers. I am also really thirsty, but I'm too lazy to go downstairs and get a coke. I'll just wait until I go get food. My room mate won't stop making noise which keeps breaking my train of thought. I really miss my nephew. I havn't got to see him in months. I hope when i go home this weekend I will be able to see him, but I doubt it beacuse his mom is such a psycho. She never lets us see him unless she wants something. I am going to call her and tell her I want to see him this weekend. I think I'll buy him a UT shirt before I leave on Friday. I put your picture away, sat down and cried for days. I can't look at you laying next to her. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing. I havn't talked to her since i came to LOCNAME. I hope she's doing better than when I left. This song sure does remind me of her. I hope her and PROPNAME are talking again. It smells like clorox in my room. I need to spray some Lysol on here. Plus I need to clean my room. It's starting to get really messy. I wonder if that's bothering Crystal? She would tell if it was. Well, I'll clean my half just to be nice, and so I can be more organized. I need to do my laundry. I guess i could do it later. 
__label__label0      wow i am so tired i really just wish that i could go to sleep. why do they put a philosophy class in the law building i will never know. i can't believe that i just walk for 00 min just to get back to my dorm. i wonder what there is to eat tonight. i hope it is good. the last couple nights the food has been pretty  good. man i really have alot of homework tonight i hope the fraternity doesnt keep me late tonight. it is such a pain to have to walk all the way to the house just for a meeting. wow i am really thirsty. i really want a glass of water. i wonder what everyone is doing right ow. i bet they are still in class. when is that girl going to get down here so we can study for math. i need to go get a map of the bus routs. or a map of where i can park so i don't have to walk anymore. oh man its only been 0 min. i wonder who im going to ask to go to the ORGNAME ORGNAME game. i wonder if i will even get tickets to this game. my band isnt very good, i better go try and find someone that has a better band. oh yeah i have to go buy my tops pictures that i took. i need to go get a hair cut. i wonder what i will look like when i can't cut my hair or shave for 0 weeks i bet i will look really funny. man my palm really hurts i wonder what i did to it. maybe it was when i was doing gymnastics tricks for people. i wonder if ut has a gymnastics team or what intails being a cheerleader. i really liked it at that last game when they did all the flips. i really hope that ut wins the national championship this year. that would be so cool to win in swimming and football and baseball all in the same year. i wonder if any other school has done that before. aww im so glad that i am done with classes today i don't know if i would be able to make it if i still had to go out and sit in another class. hey my roomate just brought me mail. wow a letter from my parents how exciting. my roomate keeps talking he doesnt realize i don't care. hahahaha he is talking about his macintosh. and his knew program. wow he has a really low band for the ou game. maybe he can get me a ticket. he is telling me a story about our pledge trainer and how he made a stupid comment. it was actually a good story im surprized. wow i think alot. i wonder when it is going to start to get cold. i don't know if i can take this heat any longer. i really want to go watch the simpsons. wow what a great show. my roomate still is talkign about his computer. i still don't care. my roomate i have decided does not stop talking. wow im almost done this wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be. i think that stream of conciousness is really ran

But now im thinking about thinking and thinking about thinking about thinking, will got mad about me not getting the wristband and i really don't care about the wristband but i wish he wasnt mad, i wish that we would get along better, we need more friends, i think b ecause i love this song so much i sing it lower i hope i feel like this tonight when i see lucy, she can either make me feel incredible like the high life and then others she can make me feel awful just because i want her so bad, but she doesn't mean bad because if she did i would havec nothing to do with her, the typos annoy me so much because i fix some and other i dont. Im feeling better just typing but i felt like death this afternoon. Its kind of scary because the medicine has a warning about suicide attempts i really hope thats not me and it just the placebo that im feeling now,  i actually getting sick of typing now i want to lay down and play guitar and think about what im going to do but that would make me depressed again. I think i will have a beer though, then i will have some water. that will even out i hope, will came in he seems cranky still but i don't give a fuck he's being a dick about the whole thing i offered him a place to stay in LOCNAME and he was completely ungrateful, but whatever, i just looked at the time and thought i was done because i saw the 00 min at the top but really im 00 away im typing what i thought and not what im thinking will in the hall i wish he would just chill out hes so fuckin pissy right now still whatever i wish it was 0 then i would be with lucy i glad she dropped that class now i might get to see her, she doesnt much care for the 000 stuff, i wish that light would stop blinking because i can't reallyk answer right now but it just down there blinking blue then grey is it blinking grey or blinking blue i don't know which its so messed up to think of stuff like that, like when you look at your own name long enough it begins to look like a shape or something Srv so fuckin good the crowd seems to like him too john mayer liked him and played PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is so different but so good but i just want to play baseball right now. im done with this i think now im going to talk to nat now  
__label__label0      I cannot wait to go and see PROPNAME this weekend. Nanny is coming into town; I love that woman. She is a great person, an amazing person. It has been awhile since I have seen her. I wouldn't mind not going to the ORGNAME game. It would be SO nice to have this place to myself without anyone else ere for a weekend. even if there ws nothing to do. I could catch up on  reading and homework or get ahead. But then again PROPNAME said that most people would die to go to the OU game and that I should accept the offers I receive. I rejected the first. The second one is someone who I just met last night. and I want to attend the game and this is the best way because tickets are so hard to get. But I have to stay in a hotel room with this guy. I guess I will just say I have a boyfriend. Speaking of. I like LOCNAME. He is very nice looking, very polite. He did everything right. I wonder if he likes me? I wonder if he will call today. only time will tell. I hate PROPNAME for what he did to me. No I hate what he did, I don't hate him. I don't hate anybody. PROPNAME and PROPNAME have become two of my best friends. I talk to each of them several times a day. The weird thing is, they have been friends for 0 years. And now, over some guy, PROPNAME hates PROPNAME. PROPNAME has done the same thing to me that PROPNAME has done to Emily. I do not really feel sorry for her. It feels weird that although they do not speak to each other, I speak to each of them many times each day and usually the other is not mentioned, and I dare not bring up the other, I do not want to stir things up or be in the middle of it. So I am going to see PROPNAME this weekend when I visit Emily. I know he will want me to stay the night with him. But so will Emily. I wonder if she would care. I don't want to do anything with him. It is just hard to put out old flames. We cannot start anything again. I just got a computer a few days ago and now it is not working! I am taking it home tonight to have someone work on it. PROPNAME is always in our dorm room. Last night everyone and their dog were in my dorm. I have 0 AM class Mon through thursday. I could not get to sleep until 0AM. Then I turned off the two larms I set and my neighbor called tomake sure I was up at around 0:00. Yikes. I hopped out of bed, brushed my teeth and ran out of my room. I want to see a movie. That is what I feel like doing today. right now. Maybe a nice sappy movie with lots of sweet romance-not corny though. Or a thriller or scary movie. but I only like to see that with a guy. Hmm. Or one with PROPNAME PROPNAME. Now PROPNAME is definitely not usually my type, but after seeing Fast and the Furious and XXX, he definitely does it for me. He has such a sexy voive and attitude. Usually I do not like guys that built. I need someone more my size. He is the exception. All 00 year old boys are assholes. I have not founf the exception to that rule. I will not even give one the time of day or a chance. I don't have time for that. But I think PROPNAME has already been through his stage. I think this one is worse than the terrible two's. I need to call PROPNAME. But I am afraid to tell her something I did with PROPNAME. I do not want her to pray for me or look down upon me. No she won't look down for me, but her heart will heart for me. But I am not really in the wrong direction. I pray. I know what is right and wrong. But no one is perfect. I also need to call my sister-I wonder how LOCNAME and PROPNAME are doing. Those kids are absolutely rotten. I hope they grow out of it. It is just that they are beautiful and PROPNAME is so cute that nobody ever can remain angry with her. I hope that they are beautiful in high school and i know they will be-not just because they are my nephew and neice, their mother is beautiful. But I hope that they are not the snobby kids. or the rude kids. I hope they are humble and compassionate. High school kids do too much damage to other high school kids. It's awful. I wish that highschoolers could lern to look at things on the grand scale. I wish they could think more term and not so much about the situation. Realize that it doesn't matter in callege. No one knows nything about you. It is a new start.  
__label__label1      i'm thinking about how if i do this all the way through, i'll be late   in meeting my girlfriend because i still have to shower and change.  my clothes are in the dryer, getting wrinkle free because i'm too lazy   to iron them. i'm thinking about last night and how leah and ia have   been having some weird moments lately, but i think that i can   attribute them mostly to stress. yesterday in dr. boetcher's office, she   mentioned dana and him being the one that leah was dating. cat's   out of the bag. i know, of course, and i've known for a while, but still   to hear someone else say it. i wonder why she never told me right   out that dana was her ex? its not like i'm stupid and i wouldn't put it   together. PROPNAME is IMing me. . i haven't talke to her in a while. i   wonder how her friend fran is. she was cute. alicia says that she's   well and that NT hasn't changed. i don't miss it. or denton, really,   which makes me wonder why i'm going back there this weekend to   visit. i guess i just miss the people, but somehow i suspect that it   will be weird to see them. to be so removed from them for months,   it will all feel alien to me. i can't imagine myself there anymore. and   teaching today. . ugh. i'm not really looking forward to it. i'm afraid that   i won't remember my shit, that i won't be able to help these kids,   which is what i'm getting paid to do. its kind of silly to worry though,   after being surrounded by math and science for the past two years, i   hope that i'll remember something. and i'm hungry. it weird seeing   tamsters around school. its almost like they shouldn't be here. like   when you see random people in a dream that creep you out   because they don't seem like they should be allowed to invade your   mind. i'm not used to all this reading in school. i wish i had a   snickers. i'm used to math homework and bs like that, not actually   having to read and digest stuff like that. i like it, just not used to it. i   need to shower. i'm worried that i won't be able to finish this. 
__label__label0      I wonder why I am so depressed. I don't know if   depressed   is the word I should be using, but I am down on myself because I am a freshman in college and I feel like everyone is way better than me. I didn't do well on the Math portion of the SAT test, so I needed a waiver to get into a LOCNAME Math class. I wanted to take pre-calculus, but the Math advisor didn't think I could handle it. So now I'm wondering if I really can or can't. I mean I thought I could because I took pre-cal in high school and did exceptionally well, but now I'm all confused. Am I really smart like I thought I was? Or did my brain turn to mush over the summer and I can't even hold a decent conversation now?  I don't even think I belong here at UT. I think I only got accepted because I was in the top 00% of my high school class. I hope I do well. I feel like I'm going to fail and drop out. I really want to hang in there, but it's hard with 00,000 people, plus other colleges throughout the world. I know that's life, but i can't help feeling this way about myself. I feel like no one cares, and the only person I can really trust and depend on is my boyfriend of 0 yrs. I love PROPNAME!  He's always been there for me and continues to be. I'm lucky to have him. College is confusing. I can't believe I dropped out of their business school. But I figured if I wanted to pursue a career in the health field, I made the right decision. I just don't know what I want to do though. Everyone keeps saying that the first 0 yrs of college don't matter because you're just taking your basic courses, but I think it does matter because certain field have prerequisites and you don't want to waste your electives on things that won't apply to what you want to become. But what do I want to become??  I really hope I go the right direction because I do not want to waste thousands of dollars on a major I won't even pursue or enjoy. I either want to become an occupational therapist, dental hygienist, or physical therapist. I think physical therapy is too hard though. Right now I'm leaning more towards occupational therapy, so I hope I actually go through with everything. I keep hearing statistics of how a lot of freshman drop out, and I hope I am not so completely lazy to the point where I'm one of those freshman. I know my boyfriend PROPNAME will make it because he's in the TIP program and has a lot of encouragement. But I am going to have to provide myself my own encouragement because I know nobody else cares about my standings. I need to start getting involved in community services and activities like everyone recommends. I don't understand how some people have time to be into everything, hold a job, and handle school at the same time. That is almost impossible for me. They are truly talanted. I think the homework itself is too much work. I hope I don't get fat. Ever since I graduated and stopped being in drill team, I feel way more lazy and I gained 0 lbs. I exercised a whole lot this summer and have not lost an ounce. I feel like everything I worked for in the summer meant nothing because I have nothing to show for it. I hope my boyfriend still loves me in return because I see so many pretty girls in college hoping PROPNAME will not fall for them. He says he loves only me, but I am hesitant to believe him. I would be very sad if he left me because we have so much together. But then again he's always been such a wonderful boyfriend and i should have no reason to doubt him. I know I should be less insecure about myself but it's hard. I tell myself to do one thing and it's like I don't even follow my own orders. Hey, my cell phone is ringing. I wonder who it is. Probably Angela. I miss her. Ever since she moved to LOCNAME I don't have anyone to hang around with. come to think of it I haven't had a true friend since my sophomore year in high school. It's always been just me and PROPNAME with no one else to call my best friend. Angela was my best friend until she found a boyfriend. But she's still my best friend and I love her to death. I came into college with intentions of meeting new people and finding new friends, but I haven't had any luck so far. The only thing close to a friendship was on Friday at the union when some guy who recognized me from his sociology class invited me to bowl with him. I would have but I didn't have any socks, so I watched instead. He was cute, but I feel guilty for thinking he's cute and having a boyfriend at the same time. I also feel guilty because sometimes I find myself attracted to the same sex. I don't know if I'm attracted to them or if I just want to be like them. I'm confused. But I try not to let it get to me. I'm curious about a lot of things, but it's hard to try any of them because my parents are WAY overprotective!  Other adults say my parents are always right and that I'll understand them one day. I am very grateful that I have such caring parents, but sometimes I wish they would ease up on me. I hate when they try to pick my friends for me and forbid me to hang out with certain people because of their sexuality or the way they choose to live their life. I think I should pick my own friends. The people I used to hang around with were just fine. They didn't engage in drugs or anything. I liked them for them and my parents could not see what I saw. It's like they expect my friends to be perfect for them and do not consider the way I feel at all. It's frustrating!! Even though I'm 00 I don't feel like it all. My parents still treat me like I'm 00 and cannot think for myself. I just wish there was some way to get them to see things my way. I've already tried talking to them one on one, but they do not listen to me what-so-ever. They have a one track mind and feel that everything they say is right. I keep telling myself that one day it'll all change, but I'm scared that it may never change. I used to argue with my parents all the time because we shared a difference in opinion, but after a while I realized there is just no winning with them. I don't really tell them how I feel anymore because it's not like they're going to listen to me anyway. It's like they have to hear it from an adult rather than myself. Even then, they'd probably go with their own judgement anyway.  
__label__label0   I am so glad it is Friday. I am going home because my friend is also going home and his parents are out of town, so he is going to have some parties. I know it will be fun. I am also going to get to watch my brothers football game. He is a senior this year, and from what he has told me he is doing good in football. I only live an hour away from LOCNAME so I don't have a long drive. It could be long though if ILOCNAME00 is bad. I just go North on 00 until I get to Temple so I am happy about that because I don't have far to go. I also miss my boyfriend who I will get to see tonight also. We have been going out for 0 months now, which is definately a record for me. I sometimes ask myself what in the world is wrong with me?  All my friends and my parents also ask me that same question. I just tell them I have no idea. He is a real nice guy though, and will do anything for me. He pays for everything and takes me anywhere I want to go or do. I do not like LOCNAME much, but i love ORGNAME. I know that is weird but I'm not much of a city girl. I hate all the traffic and the weird people. That is why I love going home because it is out in the country. We have trees and ponds surrounding us and not huge buildings. It is also a lot more peaceful out in the country and you don't have the sounds of cars or big rigs. I like the apartment I am living in this year. I have three other girls as roommates and it is a lot of fun. They are also from a small town so we get a long really well. Last year I lived in the dorms and I hated them. I lived in LOCNAME LOCNAME and they were real nice for a dorm but I didn't like them because I didn't have a kitchen or my own privacy. It really just didn't feel like home. My apartment is a lot better mainly because it is bigger. Well I wonder what I am going to do this weekend. Probably go to Cole's and do some homework and read. I want to float the river, I know I can talk Cole into doing that with me. Cole is my friend coming into town because his parents are out of town.  He plays baseball for PROPNAME PROPNAME in LOCNAME. His sister also goes there and she plays volleyball, and throws the shot and disk in track. There is also a guy from my school that plays basketball there. I actually live in LOCNAME LOCNAME- LOCNAME. Which is about 00 minutes outside of Temple. We are a 0A school and we won the basketball state championship last year. It was an awesome experience. It was the first time we had won state in any sport. We got second place in 0000, we lost to PROPNAME by like 00 points. Well I think I am going to take a shower and eat and then leave LOCNAME so I can get home in time to go to my brothers pep-rally. I talked to him last night and he said he was going to get to participate in the pep-rally so that starts at 0:00, so I'm probably going to leave in about an hour. That way I won't have to rush. This also seems like the longest 00 minutes of my life. I think I am going to have chicken strips for lunch and fruit punch to drink. I am very excited about next weekend. I am going to College Station to see my best friend and we are going to go to Ag-Kickoff. PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and other bands are playing there. That will be a lot of fun and I am real excited. I went on the big ski trip last year with all of them and that was also a blast. 
__label__label0 I just got home from a friend's apartment today. As of right now I have so many thoughts going through my mind. I have a hard decision coming up to make. It is if I want to join a soroity or not. One of my really good friends is going to rush this semester. I'm not sure if I want to do if she is going to at the same time. I'm not sure it is the right thing to do together. However, I'm still tempted to do it. The question is if it is right for me. My parents would both flip out if they found out I wanted to do it. When they hear the word   soroity   they automatically think drinking and drugs. However I have met many people in different soroity's and they are all really good people. Many of them are smart and do not fit your stereotypical soroity girl. All of the ones I have talked to swear by their life that it has made them a better person. One of my really good friends is in one and she has improved in character in only good ways. I remember her back in high school, and compared to now she is much more confident. There are many other things that she says has helped her character but that is the one that stands out the most. I really don't know what to do. It's all up in the air for now. I should talk to someone else outside of the college atmosphere and see what they think. I'm trying to collect opinions, but they have all been negative so far. Those negative opinions prolong my decision making. I figure if I do it then I have to do it now or I never will. The bad part is that I want  no regrets later. I don't want to look back and say   I wish I had done that.   I've made that mistake before and, don't want to do it time and again. I think a soroity is a great way to get involved with community activities as well. I know there are volunteer groups out there. I love doing community service and the events they do really benefit other people. Another one of my concerns is the time consumption. I know if I do this all of my waking moments will be dedicated to this one thing. I'm not sure if I can handle that or not. Plus I don't take rejection very well either. So I'd rather not risk it, but then again there is that no regrets thing playing in the process. Guess decisions will be made at a later time when I have more information about everything. Right now I like the college life that I'm living. I've met great people. My only complaint is about my room. It's so cold in here that I'm going to catch hypothermia and die before the semester is over. I can't feel my hands and I have to wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time. I doubt anyone can do to much about it. It's only been ten minutes since I started this assignment. I feel like it's been the full twenty. Another thing I don't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines. For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor. I'd have to do my laundry at like 0 in the morning just to get some of it done. Now we have three but they always seem to be busy, and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing. As if no one else needed the machines. I swear sometimes I think I'm never going to have clean clothes again. I bought more socks just in case I didn't get clean ones for a long time. Sadly, I've only been here two weeks in LOCNAME and I've already been to the LOCNAME mall three times. Each time I really have no idea why my friends and I went. Only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately. All it was a white shirt for a party. The traffic down here gets on my nerves. I think LOCNAME has the worst highway system in the world. How could someone construct such an awful system?  Don't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in. I think I've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks. It's crazy. It's so hard to get around. Just simply trying to get to a ORGNAME is a pain. Thankfully I don't have to go that often. Ever since I got to LOCNAME I my nights and days have gotten a little thrown off. I sleep at such random hours sometimes. I'm suprised I'm not sick yet. With the cold room and the funky sleeping times. Oh well it's the price you pay to be at LOCNAME. I'm so scared that I'm not going to do well in my classes. I'm not the worlds greatest test taker. Since all of my classes are based on tests I'm worried. I concentrate and pay attention but I know that's not enough to make it. My study habits are bad too. I need to get some new ones really quick!   
__label__label0      I am afraid of being here. I think that I am not smart enough or that I just don't have what it takes. I think about my boyfreind alot! he is my bestfriend. Sometimes I feel like I can't live without him. I hate feeling that way but i can't help it. my biology class is stupid. i hate sitting there for an hour and a half wondering what the heck she is talking about. i wonder what my mom is doing right now. my little sister is in school right now and is probably having way more fun than i am. i can't wait until october 0th it is going to be great. i get to finally see my boyfriend again after 0 months. gosh that seems like a long time. i wonder if he is thinking of me right now. i know he better have wrote a letter on sunday. i love getting his letters. they make me feel very happy and i read them over and over and over. sometimes i don't knwo if i am just kidding myself about our relationship but then i remember how much i miss him and how perfect we are together. is there actually soemthing out in the universe that is perfect?  is there some object that can meet standards that to majority is perfect?  i know i am not perfect. i am so nervous about gaining weight. i always watch what i eat but it always like too much no matter what i eat. i hate feeling that wat too. i love beanie babies. they are soo cute. i used to collect them but now I dont. not that its because i got older but just because i don't have the money to spend on them anymore. I wonder why people are the way they are. Some people can be soo mean but have no reason to be that way. I wonder if I am that way. I wonder if people see me as snobby or dumb. I always look around the room and i wonder if people are just as confused as me. I try to look as if i am not confused but i don't think it works to much. I want to move with my boyfriend. I want to be near him alwyas. I always think about him. Is that unhealthy?  I like pizza. it is vrey good i want pizza now. i love fruit too. i think fruit can be better than icecream although i love icecream too. if i had to choose right now i would eat a peach. i don't know why but tomorow i would probably eat icecream. I don't think that i fit into this city. i think sometimes that maybe i shoould have stayed in killen. i love music i have to listen to it in order to make my day start out good. i love dirty south music but then again i love all kinds of music. how can someone only like certain types of music?  i don't believ e that. they make themselves think that. I think that music is a form of expression and you should listen to the music before saying  what is that,country?     ewwww!    I love anything that makes me feel good inside. I kind of would like to move to florida. my friend PROPNAME lives there but i went there for a band trip and i had such a good time. i was with my boyfriend and we did everything. evreybody told us that they sat around. we went on every ride there was. then before my boyfriend left to the navy we went to LOCNAME LOCNAME. we went there all by our selves and did everything our way. no one  to tell us what to do or how to do it. it was great. We saved all our money and made sure we had enough to spend. I loved the shows at sea world. My favorite was fools with tools and how they made fun of all the other shows. It was great. There too me and my boyfriend went to every show and eveyr ride although there werent much rides. I hope we don't have to read our papers infront of the class. I don't think i did my paper right. What if i sound stupid?  oh well, i am probably not the only one that thinks that. i am not sure if i am going to switch my major becaus psychology is soemthing that i have always wanted to learn. my highschool teacher was soo cool. I loved visiting the LOCNAME LOCNAME hospital. It was so fascinating how those people could actually think those ways and believe everything they feel. I kind of felt sorry for some of them too. I don't know how to feel when it comes to people that are disabled, shoudl I feel sorry or luck to know them? 
__label__label0 I need to learn better time management skills. I'm so glad that I can finally access all those crazy sites and forums in rhetoric. Oh wow! What's up with that teacher? I do feel sorry for her though. I know what's it like not to be able to do all that technical computer stuff. Afterall, I was only on the computer last night for four hours. And I can't believe I allowed myself to sleep for over an hour and a half this morning! But you know what? I figured out that I can get a lot of work done as long as I do it outside of my dorm room. I also figured out why people say   silence is golden.  (Though personally, I don't mind a little noise every now and then. ) Oh my gosh! I totally found a gift from God today! I was sitting in the study lounge in Jester only to stumble upon a study group for 000k. And it was definitely a blessing to finally get into PROPNAME's class. I can't believe PROPNAME and my new friends are in there. Though the day has seemed slow, that was such a delight. Now I can email PROPNAME or maybe call up PROPNAME. (I talked to PROPNAME today infront of LOCNAME LOCNAME and she's taking 000k too. ) I got the phone numbers of two of the girls in the study group and both said they'd be more than welcome to help me with my 000k homework. The only thing I'm not quite sure if it's a plus or not would be the fact that ORGNAME and Rubes are in this new class as well. I'm not sure if I'm at a stage where I could answer questions as I'm trying to learn them myself. And though it sounds kind of bad, I really need to get an 'A' in 000k. Maybe I can review it this weekend and then I might be able to help them next week. Oh wow, next week! I have tests coming out of nowhere! But today was refreshing considering the fact that I'm actually caught up on almost all of my classes. If I can do that in one day. time management here I come! It's pretty pathetic, the little that make you excited. Well once I'm done with this maybe I'll have a better feeling about the rest of my classes because that's one more assignment down. Oh yeah, uh huh! I kind of wish I was a speed reader. I wonder if I'd actually get to party a lot more. Dude, screw the parties me and PROPNAME are going to build a fort. How cool is that? That's just too cool! Oh yeah, we're going to take the pillows from all our friends and were going to throw blankets over them and   POW   there's your fort. Oh and we're going to watch movies in it too! Oh yeah, people that hear about this one. jealous. 
__label__label1     Twenty minutes seems like a really long time to do this assignment. I don't really feel like sitting here that long. I'm sleepy. I guess I shouldn't have waited until the last minute to do this assignment. If I would have finished it yesterPROPNAMEy, (like I planned) instead of going to sleep, I wouldn't be sitting here now. Hopefully I won't fall asleep in class. Especially my history class- it's kind of boring. I didn't finish this week's reading either. The professor said we're not having a discussion, so I'm really not worried about it. I'm tired of typing. I know I'm just supposed to be typing my thoughts, but all that's on my mind is other things that I could be doing with my time right about now- like SLEEPING. I really want to go to back to sleep. I really don't have time to go back to sleep either because I have a class in less than an hour. I wonder if we're getting our accounting quizzes back today??  I don't think I did very well. It's completely my fault though because I only did half of the reading and half of the homework. I wonder how PROPNAME and PROPNAME did?  ORGNAME's birthday is tomorrow. The other ORGNAME invited me. I'm not sure what's going on exactly, but we're supposed to be doing something. PROPNAME is a trip!! She's funny though. She lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME, but PROPNAME and PROPNAME don't really know her. I'm glad she came to choir rehearsal. She can sing. I don't think she needs to be in the alto section, but I don't think she's going to move either. Hopefully, she'll try out for a solo. I haven't heard her REALLY sing, but I don't think that   Bless Me   is too high for her. I'm so sleepy. I'm really excited about Innervisions though. I was glad to see so many new faces. I don't feel very well. I think I'm just tired. I should have gone to bed last night, instead of sitting up and talking all night. I didn't want to say anything because that's my friend, but his room smelled like old popcorn and feet. After I stopped and thought about it for a minute, I think that was pretty accurate. I'm only half/focused on this. I'm bored already. I'm looking up random people in the UT directory. Twenty minutes is a long time to just sit and type thoughts. My sister's birthday is tomorrow. I want to go home, but I really don't feel like driving. I talked to my mom yesterday, and she said that I didn't have to come. I want to go, I just don't want to drive. I may go home the weekend of my birthday. Initially, my parents planned to come to LOCNAME, but I haven't heard anything about parents's weekend, so I don't know if that's still going to happen or not. Since it's 0 weeks away, I need UT to let me know something so that I can plan accordingly. I want to go home so that I can eat. I want some boudain, Court Buillion, and a fried turkey. Those things don't really go together (at all) but that's what I want. I want to go to PROPNAME's Landing too!! That restaurant is the bomb. I would like to go on a Friday, but I don't think that's possible. I'll be teaching PROPNAME da PROPNAME, so I won't be able to make it back to LOCNAME before 00 or 00. Oh well, I guess I'll figure it out later. Yes!!! only 0 more minutes to go!!!!  I'm not sure what to talk about for the remainder of the time. I'll just ramble for a while. PROPNAME rambles sometimes. I love him, but he can talk and talk for long periods of time. I had lunch and dinner with him yesterday. It was cool. PROPNAME is one of the good guys. He talks about his girlfriend all the time (I'm jealous). I wish I had somebody, but God is still in control. He'll give me my wife in His own perfect time. 
__label__label0      Right now I am just feeling really stressed out and angry. I have tons of homework to do and I don't know where to start, so I just started doing this. I'm also very mad because my girlfriend is being a real you know what, and she knows she is doing it and she just won't cut it out. Unfortunately, I live with her and I have to put up with this day in and day out. We also have a daughter together and at this time she is crying and crying and she won't let me concentrate at all. I just feel a lot of anger inside me, that is just waiting to come out. I'm ready to explode!  Right now all I am hearing is my baby daughter crying and crying, and I am also listening to the ORGNAME play the Texans. I'm trying to watch the game while I am doing this, but it is impossible. My mind keeps on going blank while I am doing this. I have no idea why, my mind is just going blank. I think that I may be going crazy at this time. At this time, I am also getting sick because of this weather. I got a stuffy nose and I cannot smell a thing. My throat is killing my also. It hurts and it's hard to eat anything. I wouldn't be sick if it wasn't for this weather. I'm thinking about a lot of different things right now. My mind keeps on going back to how I would be in a whole different situation if I was still in school and if I would not have gotten my girlfriend pregnaut. I love my daughter, but I don't think that I was quite ready to be a parent so early in my life. My girlfriend, well she just makes me mad all the time and she makes my life become more and more stressful. Sometimes I just want to leave her, but I can't see my life without her. I love her, but she just needs to change some of the things that she does. She also needs to learn how to cook!  My eyes keep on moving and I keep on noticing this small little chair that we have that is decorated with clouds. The clouds are white and the background is a baby blue. I could stare at that chair forever because I love the color baby blue so much. Right now my girlfriend is washing dishes and all I can hear is myself typing and the water running. My baby finally stopped crying and she is falling asleep. I just noticed that the cowboys are losing to the texans which doesn't make me very happy either. I like the cowboys more than any other team, but unfortunately they don't have a very good quarterback. I wish that one day I could be the head coach of the cowboys. Maybe someday. My phone just rang and it was one of my friends from work. I didn't answer it because I am trying to write as much as I can before time runs out. Well the time is finally running out and I feel quite better writing down what I was doing and feeling. This is a easy assignment and I don't mind doing it. Well, thank god time is about up! 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. 
__label__label0      I FEEL REALLY TIRED NOW. I JUST COMPLETED MY PRE TESTING NOW,. THE TIME IS SO LATE NOW, I WONDER IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO STUDY MY PSYCHOLOGY BOOK TODAY. THERE IS NOBODY IN THE COMPUTER LAB TODAY. I THINK I AM DEVELOPING A HEADACHE. I HAVE SO MANY STUDYING TO DO THIS WEEKEND. I HAVE MY PHYSICS HOMEWORK TO DEAL WITH, MY CALCULUS 0 HOMEWORK TO WORK OUT, MY BIOCHEMISTRY HOMEWORK TO DO. GEES THAT SOUDS LIKE A WHOLE LOT TO DO. TODAY HAS BEING HELL FOR ME. TO START OFF, I LOST MY CREDIT CARD. I WISH I WAS AT HOME RIGHT NOW. I COULD WEAR I SMELL SOETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I WONDER WHAT MY SISTERS ARE DOING NOW. I AM SURE THEY WANT ME HOME. BHUT I HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES TO TAKE CARE OF, LIKE STUDYING. I HAVE TO DO EXCELLENTLY WELL THIS SEMESTER, TO BRING UP MY GPA AVERAGE. SO FAR I THINK MY CALCULUS CLASS IS GOING ON FINE. My PHYSICS CLASS IS ALSO GOING ON FINE. I WONDER HOW MY LAB WOULD BE LIKE. I HOPE I DO VERY WELL IN THE CLASS. I JUST HAVE FAITH THAT THIS SEMESTER IS GOING TO BE GOOD. I KNOW IT IS. I AM GOING TO TRY AND DO MY BEST. I NEED A GIRL IN MY LIFE. HOW CAN I EVER GET A GIRL, WHEN I AM JUST TO PICKY. WHY NOSA WHY?I JUST CAN HELP THE WAY I FEEL. I MEAN IT IS ME, I CAN'T HELP IT. I AM LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT GIRL, NOT A SUPERFICIAL GIRL, NOT A FAKE GIRL, A REAL, BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT AND FUNNY GIRL. SOMEBODY THAT WOULD MAKE ME LAUGH, SOMEBODY THAT COULD ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM. SOMEONE TO LOVE ME MORE THANANYTHING IN THE WORLD, SOMEONE THAT WOULD DIE FOR ME. SOMEONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO GROW OLD WITH ME AND STILL LOVE ME THEN. IF I COULD JUST FIND THAT SPECIAL PERSON, I WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST MAN OF ALL. IS IT TOO MUSH TO ASK FOR. I MEAN I AM A GOOG LOOKING GUY AND QUITE A NICE GUY TOO. WHAT MORE COULD A WOMAN NEED. I AM SWEET. SWEET AS AN APPLE PIE. I KNOW THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE FOR ME. MY SOUL IS SEARCHING TO FIND YOU. I JUST HOPE HER SOUL IS SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. WELL BACK TO REALITY. STUDYING. I GOT TO GO STUDY. I FEEL HUNGRY AND SLEEPY. 
__label__label0 I simply don't know where to start. Having a timer count down how long i have to type is kind of stressful for me. I feel like I have to rush to write enough for twenty minutes. But then, how would the teacher know if I really did type the whole twenty minutes?  What if I was a naturally slow typer?  However, I am a good typer, so I will have plenty of stuff to write. I just got back from my chemistry class, and we learned nothing new. I am surprised at how well I seem to be understanding everything in that class, considering the fact that my high school chemistry teacher was a nutcase. I am like my current chemistry teacher because she teaches things in a nice, normal way, unlike my previous teacher. I learned about the basics more today, like density and specific gravity and all the other good chemistry stuff. On the way back home, however, I learned that my flip flops were not the best type of shoes to walk a long time in because they gave me blisters on the tops of my feet. The plastic that goes into the foamy part of the shoe made a sharp angle and kept rubbing into my skin until it was raw. I am now in pain because I was not very careful when choosing the type of shoe to wear to class. Today was the first day since I arrived in LOCNAME that I have worn shorts. I finally gave in and accepted the fact that it's just too hot here to keep wearing jeans all the time. I felt like I was being a slob because I wore a big t shirt and cotton shorts. I felt like I should be going to the gym instead of chemistry. When I got back home, I saw some people sunbathing in the pool. I wonder why anyone would want to sunbathe now when it is already so hot and sunny all the other days of the week. How odd. I'm relieved that it is Friday--the end of the week. I can now relax and enjoy myself with my friends. Today was also a good day because I finally got internet service, which is why I chose to do my assignment today. I find myself not capitalizing any of my letters that should be capitalized because on ORGNAME instant messenger, I don't need to punctuate or capitalize very well or accurately. My sister just got a call from a friend, and I am wondering who is calling. I really want to know but I can't ask her because she is still talking. From hearing her talk, I think the caller is one of our friends who is in her philosophy class. I am feeling a little hungry right now becuase I ate lunch at noon, and it's been a while since I fed myself. I had a few cheese nips before I started, but I regret leaving them in the kitchen because now I can't eat as I type. Oh well, that's ok because if I did eat while I did this assignment, the keyboard would get all oily and I would not be very pleased with myself. I guess I should eat after finishing this assignment. I see that still have seven minutes to go, so what am I thinking right now? I still feel the pain in my foot from my stupid shoes. I am also excited because I get to hang out with my friends this evening. I might see a movie. Speaking of movies, I am planning on seeing the PROPNAME PROPNAME movie   One Hour Photo   next week with my friends. I am excited because PROPNAME PROPNAME is a good actor, and I enjoy most of his movies. I am kind of apprehensive because it is supposed to be a thriller or scary movie. I hear my printer printing my sister's assignment, and I'm getting annoyed at it because it's so loud. I am wondering why I bought this printer, knowing that it was loud. In the Consumer Reports, it said that the printer was good, but loud, but I bought it anyway because it was cheaper than the one that I was looking at. Maybe I shouldn't have gone the cheap way. Oh well, it's a little late now. What should I eat for dinner?  I want to eat out, instead of cooking for myself because I am lazy and I don't want to make something. I want someone else to do the dirty work and me to enjoy the results. I can't wait until dinnertime, but I can't eat anymore because I have eaten too much already. I am kind of tired today because I had to wake up early to wait for the cable guy. I think I will take a break after this assignment and sleep a little. That would be nice because then I will be refreshed this evening. Yesterday, I couldn't sleep, but I don't know why that was. It might have been the outside noise from people coming and going from the parties around here. I hate the inconsiderate people who don't think about how their noise affects others. 
__label__label1 Here I go, frist off let me think of a topic, how about looking at a country side in the LOCNAME hill conutry. Useraly the frist thing I notce are the ceder trees, and while I like trees, there is something upsetting about ceder trees; they are not native to this part of the country, however they are well adattined to this climet. Sence ceder trees are evergeens they can feed themselfs all year round, which gives them avantivce over the trees that grow here naturaly, such as oaks and jupaters. Oaks and jupaters lost thier leaves in the fall, and both species of trees grow very slowly; aposed to ceder wich grow very fast. Thus the ceder trees have drowed out most of the oak and other native trees. This is upsetting to me because, while ceder forest is nice to look at, it is no where as impressive as an forest made up of old mujestic oaks and jupaters with there beatifull puple and white blossmues. Another thing about ceder is they grow close together and low to the ground, which makes it very hard to walk around in a ceder woolden area. Just think how great it would be to walk aroud in a forest of huge old oak trees over your head, that pervade shade, while still leting a cool wind througt. Yes, it would cerncely make the rolling hills of the hill conutry more beatuifull, and would surely enhace my beatitude, while walking through the woolds.      
__label__label0      I'm brandom. I type very slow right Now I'm watching ht ranger game. I love sports. Along with music they dominanate my life. I love the dallas maverics stars cowboys burn, and the texas rangers. ORGNAME worl has kill my ability to spell any word correctly.  I get terribly mad and depressed when  the cowboys or the mavericks lose. I think it is because they mean so much to me and i spend alot of my time devote to them. I will check the internet aboiut two ofr three times a day. As for music i love music My favorite band is blink 000. People say the sold out and that theeir music change. It did. But they also change drummers and producer. Enima of the state was different. But take off your pants and jacket is right where it should be. think peoplee hate whats popular. and they hate change. Band alway change because they grow more talented and shiot happen in there life. But anyway i love blink Even if they would put out a polka album that is very very very horrible i would still buy. YOu always stick by what you love. I think the cowvboys will win the rest of their games. if they lose next game then they will win the rest of those. They will always be my favorite team whether they are 0-00, 00-0 0-0 what ever. I feel the same way about the mavericks. The other fwd sport I like but not love.  I hate the map making bastard. I hate how it dallasFortworth but not fort worth dallas. Fort worth is a big city. I hat it when they only put dallas on the map. They will but clevland and mhashville bbut now fort worth. I alos hat abc, nbc and fox news because the news cast is all about dallas A fucking tornado has to hit fort worth to hear it on the news, but if an old lady's air condition breaks in LOCNAME the have live helicopter shit. I hCBS is base out of fw But they get an even dallas and fort worth news. I hate missouri because Grand pa simpson does. I hate Peple who say thing just to get a response. I love double stuff oreos. I only like apples out of fruits and potatoes out of vegtables. I've never had a strwberry or a salad. I have bad hand writing In the fourth grade my teacher said that they won't except my paper in the fifth grade. All my teacher in every grade always say that. I like chicken noodle soup. When I was little all the girls love my brother and told me. I said thanks for telling me. This followed me everwhere i go forever. If i step foot in CROWLEY the first thing someone will tell me is   YOur brother is hot.   I comb my hair or i wear a hat. I actually think alot about everything. Sometimes I put my self in a situation and i act ourt every little detail in my head. Sometime YOu can find me talking to myt self,  But what I'm really doing is acting out the situation in my head out loud. I have no really wants and desire which bothers me because I graduate in 0-0 years. I'm content with working 00+ hours a week and just getting by. But my parents would call me a loser. The only things I want in my lfe is 0-0 kids (0st girls name is makenzi ann). A dog names mike. And a soccer mom wife who wants to work but I want her to stay at home and watch the kids. And she is content with that. I also want a house. I don't have to own expensive things or drive consistantly new cars. Money doesn't rule my life, but my parents want it to . I would rather my mom remember that I don't like a salad then pay for my college. I would rather my dad work less then live in a big house 
__label__label1      So here I sit in my room just wondering about this asignment and and what it is I'm really thinking, well. I'm thinking of days that seem so far from where I am, the hope of the past I guess you could say. I'm wondering about the possiblitys of the future, I'm thinking about what a friend once asked me not to long ago,   what is your purpose for living?  . I told her I had none. That today I awoke for no other reason than the hope of tommarrow. This was a lie of course, I have purpose, a goal, just one that I am now comming to relize I can't reach. So what do I do?  I think thats what I'm think about most, what now. I'm also injoying a beautiful view outside my window of a world rolling by, sun shining, others walking by, and I wonder what story they have to tell. I need a cigeret. Hold on. God bless nicotine. It is wonderful drug. Many of my friends worry about me dieing because of it, but hey, what am I going to do today about it, nothing. I can fix it tommarrow, maybe thats the root of my bad timming, that always just wait for some other time. I'm considering what I should do about the Z delima, to go friday and just be in a state of medium pain, or to go do something else, something fun. God I hate her friends, and all there insocients and Nieveness, if thats a word. I really don't think I can handle there crap, and I deffinatly can't handle matt trying to be everyones friend, and the center of atention and honestly I don't know what to do. I'd like to go off on him tell him what I think of him and all his crap but I don't think it's my place, well not yet anyway. I need to go buy books. But I probly wait until tommarrow. hehe. Anyway. So there I was in the mists of a great opertunity and I didn't let it pass me by and yet I'm still here. Whats up with that. What is the point of endless philsphy of optimisum if nothing ever comes of it. A whole spewing of quotes just entered my mind, but I really don't feel like typing them. Ok. Now what. I see myself at a quite a problematic state in my life, no where to go, nothing to do,   never felt so alone, never felt so alive.  but then again. But there must be a way, a path, a right choice, but I just don't see it, no clear cut answer, well at least not one to my liking anyhow. A regular PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, no win sinerio. Well crap!   What to do. I have very few options at this point, go no go, wait see, leave, forget remember, give, take, sacrifice, avenge. What to do?  Well there is always another option, a path less taken. Away out. I just don't see it, I need to see it, need to free the mind of the wants and needs of myself, seperate, and ingage. What to do?  Ok, best case sinerio I don't do anything, just go with the flow, and most likly I'll get shit. I do something and things are only worse. I leave, and I make everyone pissed. Give and I hurt, take and I hurt others, forget. If I could forget I think I would, but you know, that really never works for me. I can hide, I can wait, but to forget, to let go. never been something I'm good at. I have gotten lots of advise, all of it the same, wait and see. but that just doesn't work for me, though there really is no other alternitive. So I go, I say hello, I leave. Thats what I'll do, and then, I'll go get drunk, always a good idea, yes. Ok so now what. I'm think of writting, but still feel really burnt out after the summer of writting, and all that crap. I really don't have anything to say either. I mean really what is there to say, I'm sad, I'm not at the top of my game. But that will all change, and I think that frustrates me. That there are no absolutes, that given time everything will not be as it is. Some thing will be, but there is always the possiblity for change, the question becomes what do I do to influence change, how do I minpulate the forces that are present in my own life, ussally I'm very good at that, but lately, I guess it's just to complex right now, no conret ansers to what and when and where, and how. But I see them in other peoples lives, maybe I've lost disipline, I let go for to long, and need to take up the  
__label__label1      This is a bad ass song. i wish PROPNAME were here so we could drink some beer and hang out. it is too bad he is in a gay ass fraternity. i can't stand his freaking brothers. at least PROPNAME isn't in a gay fraternity, we chill more than me and PROPNAME ever will. i wish i weren't so fucking sick, i hate the fact that i have to blow my nose every 00 to 00 minutes. and no my freaking printer is going nuts, i hope it isn't broken, it is brand new. it looked like the actual scanner piece is jammed or something. that girl i met today in Economics was pretty cute, i think she was feeling me. i wish i hadn't broke that string on my guitar i miss her badly. i haven't played in almost 0 days. i don't know if i can go another day with out playing it. i am so glad tommorow is Friday, i need a beer. i just wish i didn't feel so bad, all i want to do is sleep. i sure hope this works tonight i didn't work lastnight. i want to be a rock star!  that would the best job ever!  just playing my guitar and singing my songs!  i want to have a good time tommorow night just chill with some friends a drink some beer!  i need a beer, i am defenately going to grab a cold one when this is over. so close. 
__label__label0     I feel as if my life revolves around a world full ORGNAME unanswerable questions. I cannot seem to find what it is that I want out of life. There are so many options and turns where I can easily decide to follow, but I am so inconsistent of what I truly feel passionate about. I wake up in the morning and step outside of my dormitory daily smelling the fresh air. Everyday it seems as if there is something I have not witnessed before. I need answers to my life. I am a person that does not go through the day easily without understanding why things are the way they are. I am a first year student at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME and I have been bombarded with hundreds of organizations and choices that will lead me somewhere in the next few years. Not only academically has this burden faced me straight on, but I am confused about a girl I have met as well. As with the hundreds of organizations, there are hundreds of girls I see in and out of my classes. Do I really want a relationship so soon? And further, can I handle a girl that is apart of the Greek system knowing that I will never have a desire in joining one in the future? It is so hard to choose a path when you analyze your choices to death. For instance, if I decide to discontinue dating this wonderful girl just because I will not be able to tolerate her constant consumption of alcohol and nightly partying with other fraternity guys, will this decision have been the most appropriate one? Or is it possible I may be a bit too judgemental of her capabilities of being a loyal girlfriend? In addition to my social life, I have to maintain some arbitrary schedule which will be beneficial for my personal needs. Like many others, I have been set loose from the world I used to know and I am on a path where I control my line of travel. It is realistic yet frightening at the same time. All my life, choices have been easy. And if I was faced with an extenuating circumstance then I always had the parental feedback to support my decision. I am creating a life. It is not just any life; it is mine. I am on my own. I have waited for this moment for a long time. And now, I do not know what to do with it. Is this normal? Have I overlooked something? Is it humanely possible to beg and plead for an entity such as freedom and once it has been acquired to not desire its power as much? I am eager for the future and ecstatic for what is yet to come. I hope I am joining the right organizations that appeal to me. I also hope I will stay academically strong as I was in high school. And further, I hope I will have made the right choice with the girl I met. I have faith that I will be led in the right direction. 
__label__label1 I need to write this paper for psychology to get a good grade in the class. This assignment is much easier than some of the other assignments I have gotten in my other classes. But, then again, my other classes aren't necessarily hard. I mean, in History of Rock Music, I have to go see a concert and report on it. How cool is that?!  I wish I could go to a Coldplay concert. I would love to go to a COldplay concert. I like their music. I like the Beatles too. I'm listening to a Beatles song right now. I believe PROPNAME wrote PROPNAME". I went to the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert last October. It was totally amazing. I wish I could go again. I saved my ticket stub and put it in a box that I store all the important little trinkets I want to keep. I put all my concert tickets in there. I really need good grades in order to get into the ORGNAME school. I really want to become a film maker. I would love to become the next PROPNAME PROPNAME. Producing seems really cool, but really hard. I would love to direct, but directing seems like one of the most impossible jobs to do successfully. I would love to one day be a well known and respected film maker. I love old films. Last Sunday, the State theater on ORGNAME showed Gone With the Wind. I went to the movie instead of the LOCNAME football game. I don't like football as much as I like old movies. It was so worth it. To see one of my favorite movies of all time on the big screen was amazing. I walked to the theater, and I decided to take the bus back. Only, I was not aware that the busses have different route on game days. I got on the number 0 bus and ended up around LOCNAME LOCNAME. It turned out okay though, because the bus circles the mall and comes back towards campus. I got off the bus on PROPNAME PROPNAME street and had to walk back to my dorm in LOCNAME in the rain. The movie was still worth it. PROPNAME PROPNAME. That's also the name of the main character in the movie: The Usual Suspects. That is a good movie. For the longest time, I hadn't seen it, but then my brother kept telling me that I shouldn't see it because it is excellent. Well, during move-in a couple of weeks ago, when everybody was in a frenzy, I just hung out for a couple of days at my brother's house. While there, I got a chance to see The Usual Suspects. What a great film. The ending was amazing, even though someone had already told me how it ended. I was surprised all the same. AH!  People keep instant messaging me while I am trying to do this essay. I'm going to put up an away message so they will leave me alone for a while. My mother called me this afternoon to tell me that the product I ordered online came in the mail. I need to go pick it up. It was my first order on eBay. A friend of mine and I really like PROPNAME PROPNAME, so I found some LOCNAME LOCNAME team jerseys with his name on the back online for only $00 a piece. We have been waiting about 0 weeks for them to come in the mail, but I guess that isn't that long considering they were being shipped from LOCNAME. I hope they are in good condition. I mean, for $00, one would assume they are in total disarray. I hope not. I really want a PROPNAME jersey. Wow, I am really writing about absolutely nothing. This assignment is awesome!  Now I'm listening to a Dave Matthews Band song. "The Song That Jane Likes". I just started liking ORGNAME only about 0 years ago. My best friend idolizes them and plays all their songs on his guitar. PROPNAME is an awesome guitar player. I wish he was with me here at UT. I really miss him. He is back at home, while everyone else we know moved on to college. I feel bad for him. I wish he would move to LOCNAME with me. He works at ORGNAME and is trying to raise enough money for him to go to school. I love ORGNAME. I used to always get a caramel macchiato, but now I really like Irish cream cafe mochas. Those are very good. I have not really had any time to go to ORGNAME. There's one in the bottom floor of Jester LOCNAME, but its just not the same as an actual cafe house. PROPNAME and I would regularly hang out at the ORGNAME by us for hours on end. We would talk or play cards or chess. I really miss that. Its okay though, he is coming to visit soon, and I will be going home for his birthday in a couple of weeks. It should be fun. I'm really excited about that. 
__label__label0 Geez, I'm trying to think about what I'm supposed to write about for 00 minutes. This is weird. I wonder if people use this assignment as a Dear Diary" thing. I wonder if the psych people are going to read every single one of these writing assignments. That would be a lot of reading to do. How can they read so much? I get so tired of reading all the time. I want to have fun. Instead of having fun though, I'm always stuck in my room reading all the time. I hate reading. School reading isn't fun. text book reading that is. I don't like reading textbooks on weird classes to read on like chemistry. Why do we need a next book for that class besides for doing homework problems. No one reads the text book crap. I don't even understORGNAME why some classes have certain books. Hm. I just don't like reading. I think this means that I'm going to have problems in college later on. Everyone always tells me that when you're in college, you have to have the patience to read everything. If what I read what actually interesting, I wouldn't have a problem. Hmm, well I remember in English in High School, a lot of the books that we read were really interesting. I liked Lord of the ORGNAME and ORGNAME, and the PROPNAME PROPNAME. Those were really cool books. The bad thing about the readings was that we had to analyze EVERY SINGLE thing! I hated analyzing. I mean, analyzing is important, but not when you have to analyze stupid stuff. I remember on the PROPNAME letter test we had to analyze why the grass was green. what the hell was that all about? I don't' get it! There are some things that don't really need explaining. They're just fact. How can you explain fact? Seriously, I think teachers just want to see how well we can think of things at the top of our head. I think they're trying to teach us something on that. How well you can come up with some explanation in a split second. Actually, I guess that can come in handy. Like for example it can help you with coming up with an excuse to your boss on why you were late. You wouldn't get a "good grade" if your reasoning wasn't valid enough. Hmm. I don't know. Some teachers are cool. I miss my teachers back at home. I miss Mr. PROPNAME, he was such an awesome teacher. I somewhat liked calculus because of him. He had a weird personality. that's what made him cool. I also miss Mrs. PROPNAME. She was fun to talk to too. I miss our little group in Bio0. That was my favorite class! I loved hanging out with the gang. Geez, I can't believe that time is gone. life went by so fast. I wish I could go back and relive some moments. not to change them. but to feel that kind of happiness again. Now, everyone is so concerned with getting to know new people. I mean, I don't mind getting to know new people but not everyone likes the whole "hi, my name's PROPNAME, what's yours?". I think certain people would get really annoyed by that. Geez, there are so many people in this school, it's not even funny. I miss knowing everyone you pass by. It's kinda like that Cheers song. "Where everybody knows your name. dum da da dum. and they're always glad you came. dum da da dum. " I love that show. Hehe, it's great. Geez, life passes by way too quickly. It's kinda funny to think about how that was the "Seinfeld" or "Friends" during that decade. Hehe, but it's still funny. It's funny how people don't like watching those old shows anymore. I don't care how old they are. if they're funny, they're funny. That's all that matters. It gets annoying how everyone puts up with the same Friends reruns. It's so annoying. but still a great show. I remember when a new season would start, everyone would say "ohh, this is the last season!". the last season is finally here. I mean the show is still really funny and all. but come on. everyone knows that it was getting really old. Everyone's hooking up with someone else. it's kinda annoying but kinda cute how that worked out. But I think it's wrong how PROPNAME hooks up with PROPNAME. I'm sorry but PROPNAME and PROPNAME belong to only each other. It's wrong to see them not together. I really hate how they're not married on the show. Dude, you shouldn't have a kid unless you're married. You're just asking for your kid to have problems if you're not. What the hell is this all about how girls have sex b/0 marriage. I think it's so stupid! What the hell happened to good morals and traditions? Now everyone's a whore. that's so disgusting. How can you share yourself with everyone you see? Grr, people annoy me. 
__label__label1 Right now I am watching tv. I it kinda hard to type with these nails, I don't think I have had to type a large amount since I got them. The commercials on tv are so stupid, especially the ones for women's health. I need to get my nails filled, but I don't think I am going to spend the money on it, there are more important things that I can spend my money on. I would be nice if I had a newer computer, this one gets the job done though. I just don't know how reliable, because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers, and as a result it on its third hard drive. Last year at the beginning of the year, my computer crashed. that wasn't too much fun, because I had all those assignments to turn in and no computer. I is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted, and how limited you feel once it isn't there anymore. Everything seems so materialistic, but I must admit that I am just as materialistic as anybody else. Where my keyboard is isn't very comfortable for typing. Got that book for my sister. That is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts. mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old. That must be so hard. It seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class. I guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well. Maybe that is how she and her late husband met. Mom's birthday is on Friday. I need to get a card for her, and I need to get a card for PROPNAME. I can't forget that when I go to the store tonight. Hopefully that won't take up too much time, because I have a lot of reading I need to do and write notes over what I read. It is frustrating, because I am always reading and doing homework, yet I constantly seem behind. I guess I have just never taken this many reading classes at once before. That sucks though, because then I will have to take several sciences at once too, and that will be just as hard. It is hard to get that balance, esp. when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers. I wish I could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner. you would think that they would have more than one advisor, especially since she will or has been out for at least a month. I hope that someone from Health south will call me back, if not I will call again since I just got an answering machine and had to leave a message. I would really like to start working again, especially because I need more hours. Well technically I have enough to apply for PT school, but most people have worked there for at least a year, if not more. Some of then have been there for three years. PROPNAME and PROPNAME had been there for a year and a half or something like that. Well PROPNAME isn't working there, because he is starting PT school. I wonder how different the rehabilitation hospital is here compared to the one in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I don't think waking up at 0:00 to get to work on time will be too much fun, especially now that I am in school, but I guess I just have to wait and see if they even have any open positions. I don't really like not having a job, I like the security of know I have some sort of income, even if it isn't a lot. Of course, I think school would be less stressful without a job, but I know I could handle it if I had one. Okay I am at somewhere around 00 minutes. five minutes to go. well not anymore since I typed that. Man I haven't been typing too fast, I guess that doesn't really matter. hey there is a card commercial. I should put the stuff I need from the store on a post it. I think I have some stuff written somewhere, I usually have random post its with reminders. I know I have one for the stuff I need to get at home this weekend, but I'm not sure about the store. I'll look after I am done with this. Okay what next. I wish I could type as fast what I can think. I forget half of what I am thinking by the time I write down the first thought. One minute left. I wonder what causes me to get headaches practically everyday. Maybe I should go to the doctor sometime. It could be what I eat, maybe I am allergic to something, or just not eating right. Time's up, I guess this is it. 
__label__label1 English is my second language. probably I'll have a few grammar mistakes and phrases that don't make sense. I've just watched a really good movie, it's one of those movies that really keeps you thinking. but anyways I don't want to talk about that. I don't know what to talk about. I'm having lots of reading, I chose lots of reading subjects, but I'll be able to handle it. it's just a matter of organizing correctly my time. the more busy I am, the better my academic results are. it has always been like that. if I have lots of things to do I organize my time better than just sitting there in front of the tv. doing practically nothing. I love that though but I prefer being busy and having lots of responsibilities. This semester I'm not only taking 00 hours per week but I'm also in a student organization, in belly dance class, in intramural soccer besides from adapting to this new university-freshman idea. I like this task. it seems pretty pointless and useless but I like writing whatever. in french it would be best defined as N'importe quoi. I love LOCNAME. I really miss that country but I don't think I'll ever live there again. I don't know why I have this strange feeling that I'll stay here in the LOCNAME. I don't really want to but I know that I'll end up finding a tempting work here. I'll marry a guy from here as well. I don't know it's just this sixth sense I have. but life gives many turns. life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you'll get. hehehehe. PROPNAME PROPNAME. I wonder what PROPNAME PROPNAME is doing right now. his last movie was a couple of years ago. is he doing a new one or is it just that he has retired and is dedicated to profit of what his career has left him? My mother, she might be thinking a lot about me. I know she misses me but at the same time, she is really happy to know that I'm here. following my dreams". PROPNAME. when will I'll be able to dump him? It's just something extremely difficult. I'm used to his weekly calls and although I don't love him, I like having someone thinking of me. I want a boy in LOCNAME. I need a guy. I like compromises and being with someone. life turns easier when you have a boyfriend. don't you think? I realize that I'm a very dependent person. not on my family or my friends but on men. or a man at least. if I were a man, I would have my own harem and I would be surrounded by them. sounds pretty cool uh? I think that in a future life I will be an extremist feminist (if you understood that title!) and I will fight for women's rights. not in this life. (it's one of this strange feelings I get) but in a future life. In this life, I'm going to dedicate myself to succeed in life. what is success for me? It has something to do with PRESTIGE-POWER-MONEY. I am someone who qualifies for those 0 things. I will get them. I'm an ambitious person. I end up getting what I want. we'll see, we never know. life is like a piano. depends on how you play it. I am all philosophical today with this box of chocolates, and the piano and this superficial phrases that are very commercial but are always useful when you can't explain something. like RELIGION. Holy sake! What a complicate thing that is! How many wars and deaths that usually brings?! What a stupid thing. like today 0-00 I think a lot about that and about PROPNAME as well but whatever, religion is the opium of the masses. another commercial phrase but very very true. PROPNAME and his communism! That was about it for tonight. I have to continue reading PROPNAME and his political system for my Quiz. my life is being reduced to reading and reading and reading. but I like it, as I said (and this is to emphasize it) I LIKE HAVING RESPONSABILITIES. 
__label__label0 Well I'm sitting here typing on the computer in carother's lounge and a girl just came in as I was writing. She looks foreign of course everyone here is foreign or Asian dissent. It smell like old rubber in here I hate that smell. I don't won't to write that paper for Religious Studies. I hate writing so much but my mom says I'm so good at it. She always thinks she knows what I'm good at or what I like best. that is one reason why I came to this school because she thought it was the perfect place for me. I don't know if it is or isn't but I haven't made any new friends yet mainly because of sheri she never wants to do anything she is so anti social. I am going to move into Jester next year  I feel she is holding me back  she never wants to associate with anyone and she never watches tv. I mean hardly ever good thing I turned the tv on this morning or I would have never found out about PROPNAME PROPNAME or johnny cash dying. last night right when the new was about to come on she flips off the tv. I need to know what's going on the world. PROPNAME's birthday is today I forgot she is so sweet I should have called early this morning like I was going to  I wasn't even tired  but sheri once again  "do u want to wait until she is up" and of course I had second thoughts and decided not to I should just call her after this writing thing by myself but that would make sheri upset I had it all planned out  we would be the first to wake her up and wish her on a happy birthday. I remember when I was a freshmen and was going to wish every body in our class from catholic school and call them up in the morning but I chickened out once again I don't know why I guess no I don't know why. I wonder what's ORGNAME doing  I hate him so much but I love him so much to  he lies entirely to much just to get girls to sleep with him but his touch is so good pennebaker class is going to be so hard  why is she so loud on her phone she looks like a complete dork. pennebaker's class is going to be so hard all of my classes are. out of all the types of test we had to do. it had to be analogies  my worst kind of concept I remember doing them in ms almanza's class they would be on the green chalkboard everyday and I hated them everyone got them but me. My sat score was low because of those stinking analogies. I remember getting my first F in her class but I can't believe she died I can't believe john ritter died she was so mean yet so nice and encouragelble I remember making those X-mas ornaments that we still used today we made homemade play doh and had to mold them into something I didn't know what to do I was so uncreative everybody had something neat so I resorted to making breakfast items  (perfect breakfast for a perfect teacher  I said)  I wonder because of that man's death I thinking of ms almazna death and the times in 0nd grade. PROPNAME cash didn't even win the VMA award instead thay gave it to justin timberlake  hell probably get about a dozen more awards while johny cash is dead sometimes I don't know society does the stupidest things sometimes  the jocks in that class are completely uncute I wonder how they will do in that class. they look dumb the jocks in our class were smart and dumb. I wonder what sports they play I want to ask so bad. I wish I lived in jester maybe I could find a new best friend someone like melodi she is already moved on and is having a great time she probably wouldn't if I hadn't told her to go out to dinner with those people. I won't to find someone like the other black girls in my dorm have I want a new friend to go somewhere with not like that black girl I thought she is kinda off what she had on today o my god. and binta is nice but kinda of rude  I knew this would be fun I don't want to stop 
__label__label1 This is different, I always thought stream of consciousness was a writing style, I never knew it had a basis in psychology. Should I used punctuation, I don't think my thoughts are punctuated. These must be horribly boring to read, the most eclectic thought process and there is that annoying girl with loud voice. And my girlfriend wants to read these, but I don't want her to, she didn't listen to me, how rude. She never listens, just constantly does what she wants, and complains. If she reads this now, she will be understandably upset. We moved down to LOCNAME together from ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME and its been more stressful than I had imagined. I was the impetus behind our transfer and feel some guilt whenever she doesn't enjoy something, and constantly want her to have a great time, even though I share some of her misgivings. Although I have to say the campus is great, the school is good, and I enjoy going to class; however, ORGNAME did not match up to my expectations. Its a tier one school and I expected more, I can detect little difference between here and Northeastern, except Northeastern has more money. Do we compare our writings at the end of the year and look at how are thoughts have changed as we have become more integrated into the school?  I hope not, I hope there is some more interesting point to this class. Or maybe, this class will give me a greater ability to analyze the writing which will lead to a deeper understanding of my self. My girlfriend is so stubborn she takes so long to come to the obvious conclusions. She can't study because of the loud girl with the annoying voice and I told her to go to the library and I would join her in twenty minutes, but no, she would rather suffer. Maybe she knows I feel guilty when she does not enjoy something and wants to punish me in some way, or maybe she just wants to be near me. Or maybe she is afraid of change. I heard yawns signal the body is preparing for a change in action or state of being, maybe that is accurate, never heard that before and it doesn't occur in all situations. I did an internship at Northeastern and I hated it, that made me focus a lot more on school. I was always disorganized and rarely put effort into school, after that experience however, I want to get the best grades I can and the widest range of academic experience. I feel that the more ways I learn of analyzing a situation, the more thought processes, the better I will be able to deal with the real world  and whatever I want to do. Mostly right now I want to be a trader, a hedge fund manager, be wealthy. Predominately to have security and independence. Not have to worry about work and do whatever I enjoy. I think that would be economics, write essays on economics, and that ties in with trading and hedge funds, so it is not far. I also am interested in politics and think about running for congress. This paper clearly alters my thought process, I don't lay myself out every time I think, it has an artificial quality to it. Although, in class you said one way to deal with depression and change was to right about it, maybe this homework assignment is a self-help exercise. How come women care more about the personal life and thoughts of other people than men, in general, not every woman. I assume that someone else wants privacy and to be treated with respect but women always want to know what is going on and pry into it. People are interesting to watch though, but there is a lot of commonality in all human actions. People tend to do similar activities, not exact activities, but similar. Groups of people tend to act in similar fashions. That loud girl left, its so much quieter here. I don't know when I am going to graduate, but Ill have 00 credits after this term, and six months of an internship experience, crazy. At some point I need to graduate, that'll be exciting but nerve racking. I'm mostly worried about paying bills and saving for retirement and college for children. Its insane I worry about that, I'm 00, not 00. But being interested in finance makes me think about that now, and how important the first few years in and after college are. Since money in the stock market will double roughly every 0. 0 years on average, its important to start early for retirement. What about all the people in less developed countries, specifically third-world countries. We should do more to help them, humanity only has itself to support it, we shouldn't exploit each other. I wonder what the world would be like if people were able to look beyond the immediate future and into the next 00-00 years. They would see its in their best interest to help those less fortunate. Ending slavery and instituting a minimum wage has caused real wealth to increase, not decrease and society is more stable. Imagine how much better the world would be if everyone had a stable society, could go to college, contribute to humanity and become consumers. There would be more technological advancements, real wealth would increase faster, I'm sure we would find new problems, but things would be better. I'm not sure multilateralism is the answer, institutions do impinge upon our sovereignty, but they are better than a single hegemonic power trying to control the world. There aren't any attractive girls in here, besides my girlfriend. I wonder what that says about the business school atrium at 0 o'clock on a wednesday. Not a happening spot perhaps?  Although there a ton of people here for the cash flow casino. 00 minutes, sweet, I can do other homework. See you Friday. 
__label__label1 I am sitting in the library. I wonder if my typing will bother anybody. Wow, my typing speed isn't very good, especially on this non-ergonomic keyboard. I really hope that no one will examine my spelling and grammar on this assignment. If they did I would look pretty dumb. I don't seem to think in complex sentences, or at least I don't when I am in a stream of consciousness. o wait, there was one. I found some humor in that. when I run I try to run for 00 minutes just like the amount of time I am typing for. time goes by slowly when you run and type. did you ever have a sister? Did you? something about sitting hear and dialoging with myself makes me think of the sound and the fury. maybe I am just trying to be pretentious by making it appear as though I think with a great deal of profundity. good word matt. hopefully I spelled it right and used it correctly. some one is talking in the library. that is not kosher. PROPNAME use to always say that. I miss her sometimes. Maybe not romantically, but she was fun to be around. I wonder where my romantic life will take me in the next few weeks. So far I have met a lot of girls, but none have blown me away. hopefully there is one out there that will. my mother is dead. she really is. I think about that a lot. I think about that and Emily an awful lot. they both sorta dominate my inner dialogue. I have gotten better about it lately. I am growing, healing, and finding other things to put in my life to replace the thoughts of them, well mostly replace the thoughts of emily. I don't want to forget my mother. I can't forget my mother, or else my life will get fucked up. I must learn from her mistakes and understand that I will naturally view love from a female perspective like I had love from her. I have to be careful. Should I really be this honest right now? should I not censor myself. Really, what business of yours to be in my head right now? you can make me do homework, but can you really make me tell you all the crazy stuff going on in my head? not that I am psycho, but there's a lot going on in my mind all the time and I don't feel like anyone really gets a glimpse of that, much less some random professor with whom I have never had a real conversation. ten more minutes left. what more do you want. I am tired. I would say I am stressed out but that bath I took in the dark a couple of hours ago really relaxed me. My mother taught me that it is very healthy to have positive ways to relieve stress like baths or sodas as opposed to anything else. Its much better to chill than to just blow up at someone. So how exactly can you grade this? Should I make my comments more profound. Should I release some of the beautiful poetry of my mind on this computer screen. Who am I kidding. man, that guy looked pissed. People are so damn easy to read some time. learning how to be a good poker player may be the single greatest skill one can garner from any form of competition. I mean, you always are sizing people up, separating the wheat from the chafe, taking smart calculated risks. its beautiful. I am starting to get really sleepy staring at this screen. I am very sleep deprived. I am VERY sleep deprived, and I don't know when the hell I am going to catch up any time soon either. Being a pledge is kinda rough. very time consuming. man, this last weekend I got no sleep. friday saturday and sunday I was busy as hell. I didn't really even have time for psy 000. my eye itches. I scratched it. five more minutes. I think I am starting to feel a slight headache coming on. this is awhile to stare blankly at a computer screen. I need to relax. ok now I am typing with my eyes closed. wow I actually typed that ok. my typing is not that bad. wow having my eyes closed is nice. really very relaxing, much like that bath I took. I love the dark, especially when I have a headache. now I am starting to chill out again. pretesting looks like it might be lame if I have to stare at a comp for so long. what is that girl looking at. I don't know what to make of a library. I know what to make of a bedroom or a nursing home. they both have really clear feelings that radiate from them. not really this place. is concentration a feeling? cause if it was that would be the color of this place. another poetic comment by yours truly. just call me thoreau or elliot I suppose. Call me ishmael even. I should read more. its fun, it sticks with me, I just don't have time for it often 
__label__label1 My stomach is really full from the waffles and breakfast sandwich I just finished eating. I keep smelling this minty sensation everywhere that I go. Right after I finish this I have to go to thursday's website or pollstar to see when they are playing a show in san antonio. I feel slightly uneasy:  School is starting off to be surprisingly easier than I thought it would. I have to find a way to get more shifts at work so that I can continue to pay to go to school here. There's this band called brand new that rocks. I've been listening to their cds for the last month non-stop, they're coming around here in the next couple of months and don't know if I should go or so just save my money. Then there's this girl who I can't stop thinking about. She is my ex-girlfriend and she treats me horribly, yet I can't stop myself from wanting to be with her. a couple of days ago I went and watched thirteen" (co-written and directed by a UT grad) with my friend PROPNAME, who I hadn't seen in nearly two months. I know that every teenager on earth thinks that their life is the hardest and most complex thing to deal with, so I'll try not to complain about mine. My life has been pretty good, I've always done well in school and stayed out of trouble. I don't really party very much, I don't smoke or drink, which I get a lot of crap for considering one of my friends is the president of the hell raisers. People come up and tell me about their problems or I read the paper or watch the news and realize just how miniscule my "problems" really are. I'm excited about the experimentation part of this class and hopefully I'll have time to sign up for it after I'm done with this but, we'll see. Lately I've been acting really weird and doing things I wouldn't normally do. I started working out on a regular basis, which was always something that I tried to avoid with all my heart. I'm saddened by one of my favorite rap groups, Bone Thugs N Harmony, who have hit an all-time low. They've gone from selling out the LOCNAME LOCNAME in '00 to opening for the insane clown posse and stubbs bbq. The saddening thing about that is that icp are the WORST act to ever grab hold of a microphone. It's not possible to think of anything more painful than listening to one of their songs. It's people like those two idiots that make me lose faith in mankind. And the fact that there are people who actually listen to that filth religiously is seriously disheartening. I think I have to go to the bathroom, but I got to wait until I'm done with this and I've checked on thursday. then I have to make sure that I don't have any tests scheduled for the same night as a concert. I already have one conflict on oct. 00, when Taking Back Sunday will be rocking the masses whilst I whittle away taking a math test. hopefully I can get done with the test in time to hustle over to stubbs and catch their set, it's a highly anticipated one and they shouldn't let down. 
__label__label1 Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness     paper. I still haven't really figured out yet what I will write about, but I suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. That's good I guess,     right. Sure. It's cold in the computer lab here. It's always cold in this lab. And it's     always cold in the library. In most places throughout the ORGNAME, in fact, it is     cold. It is especially cold in the student union. I mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 00 degrees in there. There is one place, however, that I have found is     not cold - it is hot. My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. And it doesn't really help that it is still like 00 degrees outside. One thing I     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. This is very good     news. Hopefully it will continue to get cooler. So looking at the timer at the top of     this page, I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic, nor have I     even begun to write on a topic. It's just meaningless facts from my mind. I'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean. There must be some     point for this. Hopefully at least. So far my classes have been pretty good. I don't     have a huge workload yet. I assume that it will pick up eventually. Especially next     semester. From ORGNAME's experience, I have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. Actually, I am quite certain that it will be rough. I     will be taking differential equations -- which PROPNAME said was hard --  and     physics, which I know will be hard. Oh well, I can handle it. I am enjoying school,     though. It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in     my life. All the freedom and extra time. I just like the atmosphere that is college. It's fun and different. Well only five minutes have gone by so far. I'm still a little     hungry. I should have had more lunch. Oh well. I only have one more class, and     it starts in 00 minutes and is only an hour. That's not too bad. I am writing on a     Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that ORGNAME Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if ORGNAME put out programs on ORGNAME's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 0 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach PROPNAME. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     PROPNAME -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with PROPNAME again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. I am used to a program fixing it all for     me. Oh well I suppose it's good for me. But this sticky keyboard is not. Geez!  If     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. And they crazy IMer is still typing away to     like 00 of his closest friends. It's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (0 minutes left)  One good thing I will say is that     Macintosh's do look pretty cool. I like the whole clear theme. I also like the     widescreen. It's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. I think the clock on the     computer is slow. After 00 real" seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 0 seconds. So for every "real" minute, 00 seconds go by. So in a 00 minute writing sample, I     must actually write for about 00 minutes. See I thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. I thought that my watch said 00:00 when I started, and now it is     00:00 and I still have 0 minutes to write. Maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. That's crazy. I have a one o'clock     class. I hope that my "0" minutes doesn't last too much longer. Well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. I have to say that     I have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. I     don't know that I like it that much either. I have noticed that when I type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. So I have been writing for a     loooong time. Ok, my time is up. Bye. 
__label__label1 Well I am sitting at my desk. It's kinda dark in here so I just turned on the lamp. I have a lot of homework to finish, most of it for the psych class. My homework has not been too bad so far. Just a lot of reading. I am ready to go home and see my cat, I really miss him more than other things that I should probably miss more. My mom would get mad if she heard me say that, but sadly it is true. Well my mind is a blank, I can't really think of anything to say I know we are supposed to just type whatever comes to mind, but my mind goes completely blank whenever I try to write anything, no matter what it is. I guess that is why I never could keep a journal or anything like that. I would start out the first day writing some, then it just tapered off until I stopped writing completely. I have several journals with only the first couple of pages written on. Wow 00 minutes is a long time, its only been 0 since I started. I'm trying to keep writing for the entire duration, but it is weird how when you are supposed to write freely your mind won't cooperate. I guess that is what you are trying to figure out. It is ironic how the mind works, that is why I have always wanted to take a psychology class, so I could better understand its inner workings. I am frustrated that I really cannot think of a single thing however. I miss my best friend, Faith. She is at LOCNAME (spelling?) in LOCNAME. It is about 0 hours from here. I am thinking about going and visiting her over spring break, but that is a little hard without a car. I will probably have to fly home first and get my car from there. Surprisingly my parents are not going to sell it (like they originally planned) and are keeping it at home (where it is currently getting no use). I guess it was their last attempt to get me to come home some of the time. I am only going home once before the holidays. That's only for my high school's homecoming. Which I am kind of excited about. I know a few of my good friends that are also coming home for the game, so I will get to see them. That is the only weird thing about college. You realize how much your friends meant to you. It is odd not seeing them during class like you are used to. But, luckily I have met a few great people, and we have become good friends. I knew 0 people coming down here and only three of them I was actually good friends with. The other five were more acquaintances. I already semi-knew my roommate, she went to school in the same district, and we met through our parents. We have since become better friends. I am sure whoever ends up reading this really wants to know all these things, but I figured I might as well write something. Well let's see. I went on a mission trip to LOCNAME this summer. I only thought of this because there is a picture of me and some of the kids we worked with on my desk. It was truly an awesome experience. I am a changed person because of that two week experience. Well I guess I won't get into any other subject. My time is ticking away, funny how it goes by faster when you type. very ironic. and that is about all, thank you! 
__label__label0 Well I'm supposed to write and I don't really know what to say. I'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch TV. I wasn't doing anything productive so I thought I'd get this writing assignment out of the way. Do typos matter? Because I keep erasing, but I don't think it really matters. Ok I left one in. So it's really hot in here. And my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type. But oh well. I'm waiting for the cartoon Home Movies, to come on. I don't usually watch cartoons, but I saw this one once and it's really funny and I liked it a lot. Wow, only 0 minutes have gone by. I think I'm going to get pretty tired after 00 minutes. I'm so sick of studying. My roommate is talking about a little girl in a PROPNAME PROPNAME video. What song is this? I have no idea. I'm hungry, but I can't eat and type at the same time. My side itches. hold on a second. Aw there we go. Much better. So I don't understand why I have so much work to do in my English class. It's ridiculous! It's making me so frustrated. My other classes give decent amounts of work to do, but that class is crazy! I have to read 00 chapters in PROPNAME PROPNAME by Tuesday. Oh I like this song. Probably shouldn't listen to it too loud because I'm trying to type, but it's ok. I seem to be doing ok with it on so far. I'm really tired and I wish I could just go to sleep but I need to study some more before I do. I have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks. Wow, I complain a lot. I don't mean to, but I do. Ok. running out of things to say. Talk about smells. can't smell much. It's pretty plain-smelling in here if that makes sense. Damn! Only 0 minutes have passed! Twenty minutes feels like forever. We did a stream of consciousness paper in LOCNAME LOCNAME in high school and I remember how much my hand hurt while I was doing it. I need a massage. my neck and back are really sore. Maybe from sleeping on a too-small and uncomfortable couch last night. And from driving from College Station (no I wasn't at ORGNAME) to LOCNAME LOCNAME and then to LOCNAME today. That could do it to you! Well I want a pretzel. They're sitting right next to me but I can't get them. When is this thing going to over with? I wonder what you learn from this? How weird and random people are? I think I'm a pretty random person. I used to say that word a lot in middle school. I hated middle school so much. I don't know why. It was just horrible for the most part. And high school wasn't much better. I like college a lot more than both already. Well my show should be coming on soon. I can't wait to watch it. I hope it's a funny episode! I always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that's NOT funny and think I'm stupid. Not that I care, but I want people to know that it's a really funny show. I need to be studying for English. No, not English, music. English just popped into my head. Hmm. Ok only 0 more minutes. I think I can handle this. Wow, it got quiet in here. And really really hot too! At first our A/C was broken and our room was 00 degrees, and we complained that it was too cold. And now they fixed it and it's soooooo hot in here. PROPNAME just discovered Longhorn Delivery. I love that thing! I used to use it all the time when I used to come visit friends in LOCNAME. We were all pretty lazy. I'm becoming less lazy here I think. I have to walk everywhere and can't really rely on other people to do things for me like at home. I want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents. I'm not homesick, but it'll be cool to see how things have changed since I left. My parents have been re-doing the house, probably out of boredom. I think it's cute that they're doing little projects together now. I hope they have fun living together alone again, like before they had me and brother. I've been warned it's almost 00:00 and HOme Movies will be on shortly! I'm excited. I think it's sad to get so excited about a cartoon, but you have to get excited about something! Well my time is almost up aND  I'm glad. Oops, I hit the caps lock for a little bit. Ok 00 seconds. And I'm done! 
__label__label1 Okay. This is weird. I don't like assignments like this one. I'm trying to track my own thoughts and feelings; trying to be somewhat original and all I find is nothing really. Seems like deep down I am pretty reserved. Well, actually I know that I am so this is not a surprising. Anyways, there it is . nothing. PROPNAME just got home. She is my sister. She had swim team practice. I think she has more talent than she is willing to admit she has. Does that make sense? Working hard isn't her most favorite thing, though. I bet you wondering why I am expressing myself so badly. It has to do with the fact that English is not my native language. I am German. My real family is still in LOCNAME. So PROPNAME is not my real sister. She is part of the family I am staying with. Now I am going blank again. Let's talk about the family I am staying with then. They are very kind. After all, they aren't charging me anything. Why? That's a longer story. I think my host mom would be an interesting case for psychology. There isn't anything wrong with her. It's just an perfect example for insecurity at its highest level. The funny thing is that nobody would ever suspect this insecurity. And I am sure she would vehemently repudiate such a statement. But it's true. From what I understand you can blame that on her childhood. Her version is that her parents wanted a boy as their first child. Well, it was her they got. Accordingly, her parents made that very clear throughout her whole life. Well, you can derive your own implications. Anyways, she is on a constant mission to prove to everybody how smart and special she is. It goes even so far that she fabricates facts in order to win arguments. Even when you present her with indisputable facts she refuses to admit that she was wrong. She goes as far as questioning well known axioms or pundits. Anyway, I should be talking about myself. I have my own problems. I can't state my feelings. That is as far as I will go because I can't talk about it. Then it can't be cured. Irony. Now I am thinking about UT. It's pretty overwhelming. In LOCNAME my High School graduating class had about 00 people. Yup. But I will do fine. I am just having these high expectations in college. I want to find my dead poet society" - teacher. Someone that will point me in the right direction. That makes learning an adventure. Right now, I still have to force myself to do homework. Time is up!   
__label__label0 Laughing, sad, wondering why?  Failed dreams, friends, lost. Can't seem to get away from people. Why do people change, what happens later on?  Help. Everything seems to come together all at once and fall a part soon afterwards. People never grow up, promises are never kept. Life goes on, right?  Learn to live with people. Learn to get along with those who don't attempt to get along with you. What have they sacrificed yet?  Does anything matter except themselves?  Sometimes you just need someone to talk to. To let understand where you're coming from. Does anyone see what's happening?  How long until everything's back to normal again?  How long until I can trust? What went wrong?  Somewhere, I lost the truth, reason, my smile, yet still I hurt and cry and need. I love this boy. But why is he the only one that provides comfort. It can't be healthy, can it?  How come no one else seems adequate anymore?  Life has to keep moving doesn't it?  But why do things work out this way. What happens in the future?  Where does all of this lead?  questions, questions, questions  I feel like everything is falling a part right in front of me. College changes people, and some people grow, yet some people stay right where they were to begin with. Why don't people understand, or listen, or care?  Overwhelmed, just overwhelmed. Things haven't clicked" yet  Lonely very lonely, need someone to talk to, really talk to and not just over the phone every night, not someone who knows who you are, or someone who cares about you, just someone who will listen and then talk back. who doesn't care if you drink this weekend, and won't judge you by your mistakes or jealousy, or stupidity, or friends. Why do people always compare you to your friends can't you just be you, you don't have to have the same values as your friends, the same beliefs, or the same morals, yet people always seem to worry about you when it's one of your friends who screwed up. hate disgust disapproval attention  I need a hug, I just need to be held while I vent or cry, I need to cry to let everything out, but then I read that venting isn't proven to be healthy, but was it proven to be unhealthy?  And yet vitamins supposedly don't help you but they make you feel better, so can't I vent and cry just so I feel better?  Why don't people change? Do I have a one track mind/   why do I care so much. Maybe I'm the one who needs to change, maybe I need to try out what's bothering me so much, but maybe I don't. I want my own bed, I want my privacy,  is it too much to ask for her stuff not to be thrown on my bed all the time, can't she set it on hers so that I don't have to move it in order to go to sleep, and if you come in at one in the morning and the lights are off, don't leave them on when you leave five minutes later, especially when someone's sleeping. I'm hurt, I feel hurt, and betrayed and I question a lot now, because I used to think that I knew who she was, she used to be a really close friend that I could talk to about anything, yet now all I see is someone in need of constant attention. so how do I know who any of my friends are?  Or my boyfriend?  DO I really know who he is/?  I think I do. but what if something goes wrong?  And I lose him, my best friend, also. what if he gets tired of listening to me, and gets tired of my friends or finds someone else, or gets tired of having to support me?  I'm high maintenance but is that bad, and not in the fashion that I like gifts, I don't really, I just like being held and talked to and spoiled I guess you call it  I really don't know where it all comes from I just expect more in a best friend so that it's harder to live up to so that there's less a change of being hurt or quit on or left behind, or scared or in love, but what is love anyway? 
__label__label1 It is really bright in here. Maybe I should turn on of the lights off. I would except I'm writing a stream of consciousness. I really miss PROPNAME. I just talked to him about 00 minutes ago, but I need to talk to him again. Boy, is my cell phone bill going to be high this month. Haha. I still haven't paid mom for last months bill. I probably should have read chapter 0 before starting this, since it is due tomorrow and this isn't due until the 00th, but I would more than likely had waiting until the last minute if I hadn't gotten this over now. Whoops. My poster looks like it is about to fall down. Oh well, I'm to tired to go and put it back up. Yet, I am still awake enough to sit here and type for 00 minutes. I wonder how much people write for this if they are slow typers. And I wonder if they read every one of these. Especially since mine is going to be so long because of my typing speed. Man, if I were a slow typer this would be a lot less work. And if I wasn't so diligent about punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Haha. Instead of spelling I accidentally wrote sleeping and had to erase it. I wonder if that is my subconscious trying to tell me something. I'm so glad I finished that photo wall. It turned out really nice, but PROPNAME didn't seem to like it too much because she didn't have quite as many pictures as I did to put up. Oh well, that's her problem. Man, my DVD's are really out of order. I'm not sure why I think they need to be in any order at all, because in the grand scheme of things, that really doesn't matter quite that much. You know what would really suck would be if my computer, out of the blue caught a virus while I was in the middle of this, and I would have to start all over again. Then I would just wait until the last minute and probably not type quite so much. Oh well, this is for science I guess. Man I really really miss PROPNAME. I can't believe I got so upset today when I was driving home, but what can you do when you love somebody so much. I don't know how his brother is related to him, he is so strange. At least he is nice I guess. I wonder if his blindness was caused from his genes or from some other problem when he was born. I guess that really isn't my business, but I'm just so damn curious. PROPNAME didn't seem to know, so I guess I'll never find out unless I ask him, and I don't know him quite well enough to do that. Man, my pinky is really starting to cramp up. I don't think I've written for 0 minutes straight before without taking a break. I hope my Calculus quiz tomorrow isn't bad, I did the homework and everything and my professor swears that it is enough preparation for his quizzes, but yet I still remain cynical. I guess I'll just go over the homework problems again before I go to sleep. I can't wait until that ORGNAME's show comes on A and E. Wow, I was so lazy I didn't even bother to find the and symbol. Haha. I did it again. If I wasn't on this laptop I wouldn't have a problem finding it. I wish it came with a 00 key pad. PROPNAME. PROPNAME. I can't stop thinking about that boy. He is such a sweet heart, and I can't wait to finish college so I can spend all my time with him. I wonder where A & E is. Haha. I found the & symbol. I wonder if there is some way that I can find out the channels on the internet through ORGNAME's website. Man this is a hell of a lot of typing. Hey hey, I see my Monkees bobble heads. They are so strangely entertaining. That's the only reason why I'm going to watch the ORGNAME special, (davy jones is on it wahoo). That, and because PROPNAME said he was going to watch it. There's the picture I have of us!  I can't stop looking at it or thinking about him!  I'm sure whoever (if anyone) reads this will wonder who PROPNAME is (though it's pretty obvious). I hope PROPNAME allows him to stay over at his dorm so he can come visit next weekend, and I don't have to drive back to LOCNAME LOCNAME again. I don't mind driving down there, it might just be nice to have a change of scenery and have PROPNAME visit up here. I'm going to be so worried about him though because he has to wait until he gets off of work to drive up here. There are to many drunk people out on the street for him to be safe, even though I trust his driving abilities. I think I'll have him call periodically on his way up here, just so I know that he is alright. Ya, that's a good idea. I should probably go and put those batteries into my remote but I don't want to get up and find it, nor am I suppose to get up from this typing and do something else. Man, PROPNAME drank all my Hi-C. Or did I drink it all?  Naw. Steph did. I distinctly remember having at least 0 left in there when I left on Thursday. I don't drink her stuff. Oh wait, I did but she told me I could have some. Man, that whip cream I got on my face earlier from the Frappacino still hasn't come off after washing my face twice. I can still smell it. Eww. It smells like babies vomit. PROPNAME!  Why aren't you here with me right now!  I know why you aren't here, but I wish you were!  Someday I won't have to worry about where you are all the time, and wonder what you are doing, but for right now this is torture!  Especially since I am writing all my thoughts down, and these thoughts of you are more obvious to me than normal!  All the thought I have in-between are meaningless because I don't consciously notice them, but when I'm thinking about you it takes all my concentration and full attention!  I should probably try and not think about missing you during class, but I can't stop. IT isn't like I don't mind these ideas, I just know that I won't be paying attention to what I should be. Hurray I'm almost out of time. 00 minutes. and a few seconds. Steph needs to put her stuff away and keep it away from my side of room. What is up with this. I'm not going to clean up after her. I'm getting so annoyed with her sleeping habits, but what can I do. I love you Byron!  I want to drive up there right now but I can't because of class! 
__label__label1 I'm here in the computer lab doing this assignment and wondering how in the world are they going to get any information out of what I write. I think there is so much out there that we can't understand and this is one of them. last night I had a weird dream well no it wasn't last night it was the night before I was in a school but I don't recall which on and then someone shot me! yet no one cared. I was all alone and then my family shows up and they seem interested for a while and then they forget about the situation and wonder around without taking me in to and emergency room. I thought it was weird but then again I later on had another dream I don't remember what it was right now but I know that I had to do with lack of attention. I figure these dreams are happening because I'm far away from home and I don't receive the same attention, its just a matter of adapting to different environments. its weird how I'm here in the lab and everyone is in there own little world for instance the girl next to me  seem s to be having problems with the computer yet she never asks for help, why? and then there's a girl in front all into her study or research I don't know what she is doing and she looks so interested. I really don't know what else to write I mean those things came to the top of my mind once I started writing but now I don't know. I really hope arturo writes to me this coming week I mean he is in the army and I'm really scared for him specially since his last letter where he told me they were going to send him to iraq. that sucks because I got attached to him. specially at prom the night was so perfect everything was going great until it was time to leave to our houses. I mean why can't I find a guy who's like him I mean he is great he is sensitive, sweet, crazy, funny I don't know I could go on but why can't I find someone? he would be perfect but he is too slim we look like a 00 when were next to each other not that I'm fat but I'm fatter than he is. if he could only gain lets say maybe 00 pounds he would be dream guy material. ericka is changing a lot I don't know what her problem is I think it all turns out to be that she has no goal in life. she knows she wants to be a doctor because that's what everyone tells her but she doesn't really now what it is she want to do with the rest of her life. she is a lost child, all she cares for is FUN I mean its important to have fun but everyday? that's just not right. what does she want to have a boyfriend for only for sex? she is always talking about some other guy and this and that and what does she expects from this guy . she changed so much we use to be close friends but now since she is in mexico and has been there for the last year and will be there for the rest of her education I don't even know if I can still call her a friend. it really bothers me how I can get so excited for her when things are going good yet she doesn't care if I'm sad, mad , happy if I need to be hear . its all about her and just having fun talking to people when they're happy and be talking dirty and things of that matter? why!? I don't know if she is always been like that just that I hadn't noticed or she is just changed. her friends over there have great influence on her and I personally dislike them I don't think they will ever do anything with there life's because they're simply not able to work for their money they're so use to asking their dad for money. they don't appreciate the value of hard work or the having a do go to school because eventually that will put food on the table for your children. they are just plain stupid thinking their father will always be around to give them what they want. and now  ericka has become just like them and I hate that. this writing helps out . I've always thought this but not a soul new about it and now God knows who is reading this and wondering what the hell is she complaining about. or oh well . I don't know I just had to say it . and now I'm waiting for the 00 minutes to be over using up the rests of the seconds that . oh well they're over. 
__label__label0 Okay so I'm just going to start typing. Cough Cough I wonder how I got sick. Did I catch something from PROPNAME because he was sick last week but maybe it was from sleeping with the fan on high. Oh well I'm feeling better today than I was before. Wow it hasn't even been two minutes yet. How am I going to keep thins up for twenty?  Oh well at least it doesn't really matter what I type. I wish I knew how to type faster. I have to slow my brain down to get my fingers to keep up. Stupid geometry book. I hope that I did my homework proofs right. Thanks so much Mr. PROPNAME for not making me do proofs in high school geometry. I'm really not an orange juice fan, but I have to drink it so that I can tell PROPNAME that I did so he won't worry about me not getting enough vitamin C with my cold. Ooh I need to plug my cell phone in I think it's about to die. I'm really glad I called Mama today on the bus ride home. I miss her. I wonder what I should get her for her birthday. It seems like it was her birthday just yesterday. This year went by super fast. Six minutes down fourteen to go. I'm starting to get hungry. What do I want for dinner tonight?  I kind of want to order some chicken wings but I shouldn't they're to fattening and we have tons of food here. I should make something. maybe I'll just heat up some chicken and dumplings. That would feel good on my throat. That tomato soup I had the other day was really good too, even if it was hill country fair or whatever that crazy generic ORGNAME brand is. I miss PROPNAME's and good old Hi Top brand. Nobody here has even heard of LOCNAME's. I guess it's because their all from LOCNAME. Fuck LOCNAME. LOCNAME is not LOCNAME. People who say they've been to LOCNAME but have only been to LOCNAME haven't been to LOCNAME. Any way doo doo doo dooty doo. I'm seriously running out of thoughts to type. cough cough I need to go to PROPNAME's to get my Roubatusin. I'm fairly certain that's not how you spell that but oh well I never claimed to know how to spell anything. Today I saw this girl over near the MLK statue with food in her hands holding it out to the birds and she let pigeons and grackles land on her hand and eat out of it. Not only let them but wanted them to. I had to laugh because I realized that girl must not know shit about shit" to quote the Daily Show. Only five more minutes woo hoo. Let's see when I'm done here I should work on my Spanish homework but I think instead I'll fill in my new uncalandar. I was so excited when I found it at the co-op today. I had one last year and I loved it. Then I went back this year and I couldn't find them. When I saw them today I bought two in case they didn't have them again when I go to buy school supplies next August. Okay two and a half more minutes. I wonder if I should stop in mid sentence when tim is up or finish my thought. Did it say that in the instructions and I wasn't paying attention?  Oh well I'll cross that bridge when I get there. I can't believe I forgot to print the confirmation page for my pretesting  I hope I get that credit  That was one of the most boring experiences of my life I would hate to think it was all for nothing. Or naught as PROPNAME would say. 
__label__label1 Okay. this keyboard is weird. the buttons are all flat and wide and the mouse is part of the laptop. ergh this is going to be hard to get used to. why does ORGNAME make their E crooked? Does it make it look cool to them?  Ugh. I have to stop backspacing that's not the point of this thing. ooh. someone's on their I'M. I haven't talked to PROPNAME in about 0 days. I wonder if she is annoyed that I still call at least twice a week. I need to get out more . I've only made 0 friends since I've been here. well not really, I guess PROPNAME and that weird girl across the hall from PROPNAME count. I haven't started getting friendly with anyone in any of my classes and that's going to bad when, my foot is asleep. studying crap needs to get done. Why does PROPNAME always sleep. I have to walk on eggshells if she is constantly napping. isn't the 00 minutes up yet?  This is taking forever and my hands are colder I wonder if that saying about guys being turned on when their hands are cold is true. This chair's uncomfortable. At least I organized my junk some. I need to buy paper towels next time I go to the store. I'm kind of hungry but I've already had about 000 calories today. these keys are so weird. I keep missing letters because they're not where they're supposed to be. good I wrote the right type of they're and not their. I hate when people mix up their spellings. I probably did in this thing. I hope no one reads it. I have nothing of substance ever going on in my head. I like the clicky noises the laptop makes. I wonder if I'll be able to connect wirelessly now that I bought that card thing. I'll have to find those place things where wireless can be used. I bet the school lied about them being almost everywhere. wankers. ugh I keep hitting the mouse thing. it'll take forever to get used to this thing. 0 and a half minutes to go. come oonnnnn. I don't want to do this anymore. at least I won't have to do a research paper for this class. and the writing seems to be easy so far. My shoulders hurt and my fingers are still cold. Will these people please stop loitering in front of our door. so freaking rude. Now the pain's spreading to my neck. I need a break . wonder if I'm getting carpel tunnel Not again. Damn computer. why did I want a laptop so much. not worth it. stupid ORGNAME . need to stretch. 0 minutes. I have to do French after this. why is that class taking up so much of my time. I need more free time. why can't it be like it was the first week that was nice. Why does. oh crap this is showing up on-line. people are going to read this. What kind of loser would waste their time doing that. I sure as hell don't have time for anything much more than homework and trying to get in a nap somewhere. How can people sleep on the grass? Don't bugs fly in their ears and noses. don't they worry about the sun damage they're. am I the only one around here who uses sun block. why am I only writing in question form?  stop. stop. thinking about my fingers which are still cold and pretty dry looking. Now what was that? What are you doing computer don't disconnect my I'M! Damn you, I didn't tell you to do that. piece of crap. Still hungry maybe I can type and reach over for a granola bar at once. Do circus people ever get bored entertaining ungrateful idiots?  Do PeTA and those SpCA people check up on them to make sure they don't mistreat the tigers and elephants and stuff. Oh almost done thank you. woohooo!  Continue writing my butt! 
__label__label1 Wow, I really don't feel like typing for 00 minutes, especially because I can't type all that well. My foot really itches. It is so hot in here, my roommates keep the air up way to high. My hands are sweating, and it takes a lot fir me to sweat. I feel terrible. I really hope that I'm not getting sick. MY nose really itches. BAD! sniffle. I really miss PROPNAME. I wish he were here right now. Now my elbow itches. And my nose again. This commercial is so gross. I would run the other direction too. my legs are sweaty too. I wonder if the sweat will mess up my keyboard. I wonder where Ky is. gahh I really hope he doesn't like me. He is cool but I just don't want to go past friendship. My eyebrow itches too. man, stuff really itches when you are paying attention to yourself. My shoulder and nose both do. I have a lot of knots in my shoulders too. Maybe PROPNAME will I have me a massage when I go home this weekend. That hair is on my nerves. I have so much reading to do, I don't think I will ever get caught up. I am really worried about PROPNAME. I hope she can get everything figured out money wise and also with her math. I don't know what I would do if she weren't here. Man my hands are sweaty, it is so hot in here. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing. He is having that dumb study group at his house tonight so I probably won't be able to talk to him that much. I love him. I wish he would be able to come here and visit. His parents would never let that happen. He is coming to the LOCNAME game so maybe him and his dad can come see my place. My arm itches. Now the other one does, and my shoulder. I have a lot of knots. It felt great for them to be rubbed. My nose itches. I am so stopped up. There comes the air, maybe it will cool off. PROPNAME must keep her air on like 00. I cannot type at all! my legs are stuck to this leather couch. I really need to go to PROPNAME's to use her nair. My foot itches. I really need to go work out. I cannot gain weight this year. I need to shave too. I have so much that I need to do, but there's no way I can do it all. My hands are still sweating, but it feels better now that the air came on. Only 0 more minutes. This sweat better not mess up my computer. There goes PROPNAME's alarm. My eye itches but I can't scratch it because of my make-up. I have to change the TV. felicity just gets on my nerves. My ear itches. and my thigh. and my other ear. and my eye. wow! oooh Friends is on. but so is Trading Spaces. I love that show. Genevieve really gets on my nerves. Oh this is the kids version ugh I sneezed. I guess I will watch Friends now. Oh my 00 minutes is up! yay I can stop     
__label__label0 Wow, this is incredibly hard to follow my thoughts when I am focused on this. It is too hot outside, I really don't want to walk all the way over to PROPNAME today. My head hurts. College is so stressful, and I feel like I have a heavy weight on my chest. My roommate is annoying. She does not go to sleep until after 0 in the morning, and I can't sleep with the lights on. I am absolutely exhausted. I don't like NYPD Blue. Why aren't there any good shows on when I am actually in my room and able to watch TV?  My head is starting to hurt more. I am straining my eyes too much. My chair is in a really awkward position with my keyboard. I don't know how I am going to write for 00 minutes. It has only been 0 minutes and it seems like an eternity. Cherry coke is yummy. Stupid computer!  It keeps freezing up on me. I hate technology. Our room looks so unbalanced. My side is really decorated and my VI equipment takes up a lot of room, but my roommate's side is very bare. She isn't a very decorative person anyway. One of my friends is coming to visit on Saturday while her husband is at the UT vs. LOCNAME game. I am nervous about seeing her. She is worried about me and wants to spend time talking. I don't know what I am going to tell her, because I don't want her to be disappointed in me. I am such a horrible person. I don't know why I am the way I am. It really hurts. She wants me to go and see a secular psychologist if I get desperate enough, but I don't like psychologists. Especially if I don't know them. There is nothing wrong with me though. It is all a matter of learning to bury bad things inside of you. I miss my friend PROPNAME. I talked to her last night. Skittles are cute and yummy. They are so colorful. They cheer me up. My heel hurts from resting my feet on my hard drive. I am thirsty. I think I will take a sip of my cherry coke now. Wow, it has only been 00 minutes. My tummy hurts. When I get nervous my tummy gets upset. I really need to wash out my cereal bowl from last night. But I am too tired right now. Maybe later. The weather can't decide what it wants to do. It goes back and forth from being sunny and cloudy. I like it cloudy because the sun hurts my eyes and it is so very hot. Plus I am allergic to the sun, and I break out every time I am in it for any length of time. So not a good thing. I cut my finger on my soup can the other night. I have so much homework to do and I don't know how I am going to get it all done. The Psychology book is so boring. I can't get into it to read for any length of time. I miss my drill team. I won't get to see them until Christmas break. It was such a huge part of my life for the last 0 years that I am lost without it now. My friend PROPNAME has a bad cold. I took her a care package two days ago. I wonder how she is feeling. OUCH! I rolled my foot wrong. That hurt. When are my twenty minutes going to be up?  I am getting tired of writing. This is a very odd assignment. I hope I am doing it right. Oh well if I am not. My head itches. Hmmm. That's interesting. My lips are really chapped. They kinda hurt. I wonder where I put my carmez. Just another minute and a half. Hmmm. I hope it does not rain today since my class is all the way across campus. That would not be enjoyable. Especially since I carry my laptop with me. Well my time is almost up. Ten seconds. Yay I am almost through. 
__label__label1 Today is September 00th. I was reading some articles on ORGNAME. com about whether or not we should commemorate this. I had a class at 0:00--I wish I didn't have to wake up for this class. It seems like whenever I have to wake up for a class it drains me of energy. I'm glad that the only other class I have is in the afternoon today. Speaking of which I'm going home for the weekend--that makes me happy because I will get away from everything related to ORGNAME ORGNAME. My roommate was in the room, he just left. I am writing on my laptop--it's very hard to use this keyboard. I am tired right now. I don't know what to do. I have calculus homework to do. I feel like it has been looming over my head. I can't wait to go to home. I feel more comfortable here at LOCNAME now. I think I'm getting along with everyone. I don't feel stressed out anymore. I feel like there is nothing to be bummed out about. I will find what I like to do here. I might join the badminton club. That sounds like fun because I used to play badminton and now I don't anymore. I don't play it anymore because I don't feel like it. Being at ORGNAME is a lot of walking, I'm tired cause of it. I think a lot of my thoughts are being filtered when I'm typing. I am LOCNAMEn. My parents are from India. They are very nice people and they are at home. Sometimes I feel like they miss me and I miss them. I am going back to see them. I am getting tired of typing on the keyboard. I think I am a smart person. I wonder if other people think I try to act smart. I don't really care if they do. I'm just being myself. I get along with others. I don't think I will be completely satisfied in life thinking I have to be something when I grow up. I should just stay happy as I am right now. I think that would be a good life plan. Just take it easy. That's what I'm doing right now. My computer is a ORGNAME and it's a laptop--with a small keyboard. I got it new. My roommate just came in. He is doing the laundry. I feel like he feels that he has a lot to do. It seems to me he likes to work. I am going to keep my life simple here at college. I won't expect myself to be a superhero. I think waking up for class is good because then the day doesn't go by. In college you have a lot of free-time. I think I spend too much time studying ineffectively. I should set good goals and then spend time making friends. I am very happy right now. I feel kind of just like sitting here and not getting up. I have to get up to get the trash. Whenever I do work, I think of doing it in sequences. Sometimes I act smart. It's okay--I like to make intellectual jokes a lot. My parents used to take the trash from my room when I was young. They did a lot of things for me. Now I have to do a lot of things on my own. That's okay--we're almost out of milk. I'm going to get paper plates and paper cups so I can just throw them away after using it. I'm getting hungry. My roommate is eating Spaghetti from downstairs. That tastes good. Am I being artificial?  Am I talking as if I want people to hear what exactly I'm saying. I don't now. bye     
__label__label1 Ok so here I am sitting here writing what I am thinking. crap forgot to look at the clock. ook 0:00. kinda took me a while. analog clocks. hey what did the digital clock say to the analog clock?  look ma, no hands!  yea that is pretty lame but it just popped into my mind. hah I almost wrote pooped into my mind. that would been shitty. does anyone care if I write curse words?  because I think in curse words all the time. dammit my eye itches. alrighty that is a little better ok I'm still just writing not really thinking about what I'm writing or at least trying not too because I keep making all kinds of spelling errors. I can type fairly fast but when I do its fairly shitty. I keep making mistakes and having to go back and erase my mistakes so it kinda takes away from my train of thought. or stream of consciousness (sp?) as u call it. I'm not really a psychologist type person. I'm only taking this class because it sounded like the least boring of the 00 or so choices I had. plus I could tell my friends why they are so stupid. or, well, that was my original plan. I don't know now, but it still seems fairly interesting. I'm not trying to kiss ass there like I sometimes do, and am fairly good at by the way, I really think its interesting, for them most part. like the lie detector test. I found out how to beat on of those things. just lie a lot, then tell the truth occasionally and switch it up enough that it confuses the shit outta the machine. and also make sure that the investigator person does not know whether your lying or telling the truth, you know kinda play stupid. lie when you don't need to. tell the truth but make it sound like a lie. convince yourself its a lie even though you know its the truth. heh my foot itches. reminds me of that time in class you were talking about this assignment. whenever you mention this stream of consciousness writing my foot always itches because you had that stupid itch comment. it was not really stupid just annoying and it bugs me and it was annoying. and it still is. hey my typing has gotten somewhat better of the the last few minutes probably because I'm not concentration so much of fixing my mistakes. so you'll just have to live with all my shitty typos so there ha!  yoo can't stop me because you just said write what on your mind and what if there are a lot of rtypes in my mind?  hihn?  huh?  what u going to do about that?  this charis too low. there we go that is better but now it won't rock. htere fixed that too ok now this is linda wierd because my legds are pusing against the bottom of the desk which sucks because/ I can't lean bakc as much. and my wrists are stargting to get tired because they have nothing to lean on. I have no where for mu wrists theya re ruined! damn my desk for now havign a wrist rest. ok this chari is too high now. and mt arpmits are sweating and I have no idea why. thta happens a lot and I hate it. it makes me look like a nervous fool evcen if I am. ok chair lowered back to where it origicnlly was ok now I'm not even looking at the words I type I'm just staring at my fingers as they type the words and not relallyt thinking about what I'm typeing that sit be interesting to see wat kinda crasyt shit comes of out omy  head I know what kind of mistakes I'm makeing but I'm trying tnot tot chrorect thim and now I'm tryinf nor ro ecen hink just let my ifngers flow and let them do the talkjing not me oand now my eytes are closed that is not workingbla bla bla bla bla I'm still writing now how do u like that?  ur not even going to read therse are you?  I just know it your just doing this for some reason that no one knows yeet but it will be so obvious after u explain it that everyone or at least me will fdeel stupid. u know kinda like that lie detector tesxzt. if u had explained it before then it wouldnt have worked. if I knew how a lie detector test worked then it wouldnt really be that hard to beat. and since u said that they're so accurate, that is making us think that they work all the time so then if we ever get convicted of a crime, or at least on trieal then we'll think that the lie detector works and we won't be able to fool it but then you told ous how it worked and so now we know that is it is not har as accurate as u originally tol us that it would be ok maybe I should just randomyl type letters and see what comes out I'm fsitting here typeing words onto my computer screen and I really doint beel like isttint here typing words I really want to be sleeping of playing counterstaiek or fucking my girldfirend. ytes that last one idont know wny trs last but that sounds really good right now, don't u think. /  but you have a wife I'm sure that uve been doing for a long time so it kinda lost its spart me and meagan have been together 0 years and have been fucking for one yea she thot that she would wait till he was married but yea that is just jddidnt turn out and its not like I forced her we just did it one day without really thinking about it and it was good and I'm getting a little hard now just thinking aobut it myabe I shouldnt be tell ing u this shit but hey u asked its ur own fault if u don't like what I'm witing mmm yea that sex sessions sounds really gfood right now I wish she was here. shed kinda bubm tho so she is goin to acc but hopefully she will be smart enough to transger to a good skoo like ut next year and we can get an appartment together and fuck all the fuck we want. that wousld be fun I would like that. come home after a long day of school to come in my woman  yea, tat would be nice. are you still following me?  hey my roommate just walked in es in his air force unouiform hold on I'm going to explain to him what I'm doing ok no I'm not he didn't ask so he problably does not carel;  ill assume he does not care. aww I stopped thinking about meagan and my erection went away now I see what u mean about how himans can just think about a ember of the opposite sex ad get ariysed but then they can be in the same room as them an not be. let me tell u that does not happen that often. the second one that is. us being together and me not wanting to jumop on her. unless we;kre fighting or my friends are around. either of those. ok my roommate is talking on the phone and its kinda distracting me ookk he is done now well I think its beed 00 minutes I just looked at my watch and yteal I think tis 00 minutes, 0:00  ok cya in class oink 
__label__label1 Ah! 0secs! O no 00 sec! er. er. what am I supposed to type. this is kinda stupid. ah! phone! must not answer. must not answer! hi PROPNAME! er. talking to PROPNAME. typing with one hand. not thinking straight. can't multi-task. Ah! 0min 00 sec! hang up PROPNAME! hang up! eeek. panicking! Talking about tomorrow's chem Exam. Man, didn't even know until just a few minutes ago when PROPNAME called to remind me. Hm. I should start studying right after I finish this. I got to get more organized and responsible. I wonder what other peoples thoughts are like, I watched What Women Want not too long ago, that is a very interesting movie. it says a lot about how women think. I wonder if any of it is actually true. wouldn't it be nice to know what women are thinking. I would like that power, I can never really tell what they are thinking. my room mate is watching an anime with cute girl voices and drama. I think it's called LOCNAME LOCNAME or something like that. reminds me of Fruits basket. o well, hm. there never seems to be adiquet lighting around my work area. maybe I should get another light, my room mate is laughing. the anime sounds funny, making all those funny anime noises. I miss something. I don't know what. I should call An-Vi earlier today, I think she was kind of disappointed that I didn't call her the other day. I wonder how college is like for her in ORGNAME, she says it is nice and all, but I bet there are a lot of good looking guys there. heh, what am I talking. thinking about. shouldn't worry. hm. I wonder. don't know what I'm wondering, PROPNAME's thoughts were much better I think, mine are just not really relevant. ice cream. why? I don't know. being influenced by others thoughts :p o well. need more water, can't drink water from first few weeks of school. I miss hugging her. I feel lonely. don't know why, there are a lot of pretty girls in LOCNAME LOCNAME, a lot of asians. wonder why everyone likes to party so much. mom always says that there will be someone for me, there are tons of pretty girls in LOCNAME. guess she was right, but don't know if any of them will like me. :sigh: I would like a better hair style, mine seems too plane, I would like to spike it like PROPNAME but not as short as most guys nowadays. 00 min. I wonder how much I've written, I should learn to type faster. ice cream. food. hm. I've been eating less lately. pretty much only eating lunch. a late lunch at that, The hills are a live with the sound of music!" heh, don't know why I just thought of that, 00 min. hm. :looking at finish button: I wonder if I'll be able to print this out. I feel like I'm not thinking deep enough, I wonder why. should I go back this week or no? I want to because my parents probably miss me, and I want to tell them to be less stressed so their immune system won't become worse. there is a potluck party this weekend back home apparently. my roommate is going back, I'm not really thinking any of this I think. it's more like a cover of what my mind is really chaotically thinking about. I don't know, I can't explain it. I can't sleep well. never could. wish I could. then I could stay awake in class. :blank:. well, Merry x'mass for you is on my songs list. it's sung by PROPNAME PROPNAME. wouldn't it be nice to be friends with her, I wonder if I can ever become really important, eh, I think it's more important to know as much as possible and help more people, like superman or something. well, hm. about 00 sec left. I feel like I should type something more meaningful, I've pressed backspace a lot. I wonder how my sister is. I want to go to a party. and meet more people. I wonder how PROPNAME is, he was mad at me, don't know for sure now. PROPNAME is cool, she likes some things that I didn't know anyone else would like, interesting how life works out. didn't know my friend in high school's hobbies would make me interested in something that someone else would be interested in. funny how life is. I've coincidently met people I've not really known but just know on the streets of the campus lately. like Grace and PROPNAME and some other friends. I think I'm getting better at talking. I want to get smarter. I feel small for some reason. dreams are for the lazy. goals are for the ambitious. I like to dream. I'm ambitious. is that bad or good? I have no idea. 
__label__label0 What an odd assignment, write about anything for 00 minutes straight. I really like ORGNAME but it is so huge, sometimes I wished I had stayed in LOCNAME LOCNAME. My boyfriend and friends are still in College Station, I was so close to LOCNAME and that is were my family resides. Its only a hour and a half drive but from LOCNAME its an extra 00 minutes and you can definitely feel the difference when driving. My brother is nearby in LOCNAME LOCNAME and that is only spitting distance from here. While living at home this past summer I didn't like it that much, now I really miss those crazy people I call my family. There was always a fair share of fighting but in some weird way that is how we express our love. I really need to start working out again because living in Austin is making me chubby. You would think that walking around campus would be enough exercise but you are sadly mistaking. I have so much math homework which by the way is due tomorrow, I can't wait to see my boyfriend who is coming in tomorrow. Its our 0 month anniversary and most of the relationship has been a long distance one. I have known him for about 0 years now and its definitely better to be friends first. My family loves him except for my crazy step dad, he is pretty weird guy anyways. He is always grumpy about something especially when it comes to money. Money really is the root of all evil, but you can't live comfortably without it. Everything is so expensive now and days, the cost of gas is absolutely outrages. What is crazy is that me and my boyfriends anniversary is on such a tragic day in American history. So many innocent people lot their live for no apparent good reason, and it all happened instantly. Its very scary to think that today could be your last on this earth. Its hard to imagine what I would do if somebody close to me perished in such a horrific way. Its hard to think about without getting emotional. I would hate to grow old and have to watch my loved ones pass first, I would rather go before everyone even thought that sounds greedy. Its pouring down rain right now, and I hate living alone when the weather is nasty outside. I'm tired of being broke it seems to suck my spirit right out of me sometimes, I definitely feel I'm paying my dues though and hopefully I can do something positive with this college education. 
__label__label0 how to begin, I have started writing my stream of consciousness paper and now I'm trying to think its hard to think when your are asked to think about thought or your own thought why I feel this is a strange assignment o well I don't smell much right now but I hear the tv which I fixed last night I did a pretty good job even though I still have an extra screw left I'm watching scooby doo its very funny to watch now the commercials are on which I hate its 0 00 tonight I'm going out to eat and to the book store with my friends and maybe to an art museum I'm glad I get to get off campus the football game and weekend start tomorrow I'm excited to see the texas arkansas game as the season progresses the competition will become harder the band is a neat experience I have always liked marching and now I get to do it for a very widely known organization its a lot of fun I have only been typing for 0 minutes this is going to be a long 00 minutes there is nothing I can do to make it go by quicker even if I type slower, no I'm trying to find something else to think about, so I am disrupting my stream which is ironic that I have not really because I'm on a new one and recording it right now which is even more ironic and it will never end . until now. so her ei am looking for my new stream and hoping this assignment will be over soon so I can start my weekend and maybe get some food I'm very hungry now  I have not eaten all day and I'm hungry now I need to get some food, maybe ill get some chick fil a or taco cabana or some kind of fast food most likely seems like that and cafeteria food is all I eat lately its not a very good realization drew just walked in the door he is my roommate he just asked how I watch scooby doo its so mundane" he uses vocabulary to impress people and I just wrote it in my paper to impress people. very ironic as well john ridder died today he is the star on threes company and 0 simple rules and he died on set suddenly its a weird thing I would like to live a long life and maybe die suddenly tho and not have to know I'm dying although I'm not afraid to die I feel I have a place to go though, my afterlife is set many people here don't believe in God and I don't know why it seems to me to be the only answer we have not even figured out the human brain and we dare to declare that there is no being beyond our comprehension we can be a very proud society for a people that can't stop murdering and slaughtering each other anyways I have been trying to help people understand that PROPNAME came to give love and to break us away from sin not to tell us how to live I guess that makes me intolerant many people here feel that me showing what I believe is imposing my culture on them which I guess could be true but I'm not trying to break them from their traditions I'm just trying to . my roommate just started talking, "arafat refuses to leave, and the LOCNAME is blatantly pro-israel. "no, if the us was blatantly pro-israel world war three begins. I stopped following the conversation with california governors my roommates friend is here now and they are arguing politics, current affairs, the such, . scooby doo caught the bad guy, I'm satisfied now, man my fingers hurt and this writing is getting very tiring I wish I could be done now but I have to keep writing they are talking about proposition 00 now bla bla its very hard to concentrate on two things at once but I guess that is what college is about my physics homework is next to me I'm very glad I am understanding most of it I was proud of myself today because I finished most of my hw which is due next monday we have an exam in two weeks and I think I will do very well I also have an exam in this class and I'm very not prepared hopefully I can sit down and read through the text we will have to have read thus far and begin to see what this class will teach me I also remember that I have to do some experiment hours for this class hopefully I will have some free time in the weekend ahead to do some of them  I am beginning to smell food man I am so hungry I'm not thinking about much now because I am so focused on how hungry I am and what I would like to eat yet I'm thinking about thinking about what I want to eat and so forth. this assignment is very weird because you can't have people record what they think because now they are thinking about it so its in a way rigged and it will always be there is now way like this to have people understand how they think because whenever they think about it the point is gone, the twilight zone is on now I love that show me and drew are collecting the videos of them we have 00 episodes now and they are all classic ones the shows are not only always very ironic but they have social issues of the time in them which is very good, I like them, I have seen a lot of movies lately maybe because that is the easiest way to divert myself, its weird how humans always need diversion and now when I can't even write my thoughts I have to divert myself by talking about diversion man I can't wait to see what heaven has to offer, soon enough, only 00 seconds left now I can't wait till heaven its almost here three two one z         
__label__label1 I forgot that we were going to be timed, I wonder if we have to type well, I wonder if everything has to be in complete sentences or even have the correct use of grammar. This is kind of harder than I thought. So should I go back and re-write my first phrases in complete sentences? Oh well, I don't think I will. I'll just keep going. I need to keep typing about something. I need to type what I'm feeling. I'm feeling a little stressed because I have to keep typing all this time. I wonder how long this should be, especially if I have to keep typing for a whole twenty minutes. It's only been three minutes. Geez! I thought this was going to be an easy assignment. Well, it is relatively easy. It's just different from what I expected. I wonder if sarah and Christen have gone to bed yet. I never know how late they stay up because I'm always. oh my phone is ringing! But I can't pick it up because I have to keep typing. Oh well. They can wait. I bet it's PROPNAME. I still haven't met him. But PROPNAME said he wasn't even that cute. He is a sophomore though, so he has at least been interesting to talk to over the phone. I need to call PROPNAME and make sure we can all go out on Friday night. My shoulder is sore. I wish I was a professional athlete who received massages after working-out. That would be so nice. I can't believe I ate those ORGNAME's Treats cookies. I hate that. It takes so much energy for me to get motivated to walk all the way over to the gym and then run three miles. But then I just come home and waste all of the calories I burned off on cookies. I wonder why I get those cravings for sweets. I keep thinking that it would be so easy for me to just cut out all sweets from my diet. I'm running around the track in such pain. I really hate to run. Well, I guess I don't hate it. It does feel good at times, like after you're done and you've accomplished three miles. But while in the middle of the actual running it feels so hard! It takes a lot of mental strength as well as physical strength because you just keep thinking about how much nicer it would be to just stop. I wonder who is actually going to read this? I hope no one expects me to be a proliferated prowess. I don't know if that even makes sense. PROPNAME, my friend at ORGNAME wrote that today in her email. I have such respect for people with an abundant vocabulary. I feel that way mostly because I lack the. see I can't even think of the words. I lack the ability to think of the words. The bottom line is I need to work on my vocab because I just don't have that thirst for expanding my vocab unlike PROPNAME. However, I did pick up a pocket dictionary and a thesaurus while I was getting my school supplies. I realized that my spelling abilities were quite embarrassing. But then ironically when I finally took the time to look up certain words for their correct spelling, I couldn't find them in my dictionary! I never look words up because I just lacked the motivation and then when I finally tried to change my ways and be picky and start paying attention to details, like how words were spelled, they weren't in the dictionary! It just goes to show that I can try but I'm pretty sure that there will never be a drastic change in my abilities to spell or expand my vocabulary. Maybe I need to read more. I need to read the newspaper everyday. I hated hearing that I had to pick up and read a news paper for my government class. My neck still hurts. I need a massage. I would love to just get massages all the time. That would be so nice. I only have two minutes left. It feels like I haven't been typing for very long. I think typing messages to my friends on instant messenger has made me a better typer. I still can't type very fast. almost done. 00 seconds. wow this is a long 00 seconds. 
__label__label0 clear waters beckening - wow - this is not going to work - my mind is blank - or is it. - is it just blank because I have to write down what is going threw it. hmmmm its 00* degrees celcius right now. that does not even really matter, I prob. won't go outside unless I need to smoke a cigarette or something. spike tv. what kinda dumb sh** is this. this show sucks - why are they trying to advertise this show with some crazy exciting name like spike tv" - 00 minutes is a long time to be typing. I wonder if it matters how crude my thoughts are. better keep tha inappropriate thoughts out. is that possible. yeah. school takes up a lot of time - and I don't know if getting a degree will even matter, so what is the point. I should just stop typing right now, pack a bag, get in my car, and drive to mexico. I wonder what the point of that survey earlier was. where do all these "personal type surveys" going. is some little guy sitting behind a desk compiling information about me based on the questions I filled out about once a year since I was old enough to go to publicly funded schools. if there really is a guy that is comparing all my information right now - I wonder how much someone in that position would get paid. hahah - getting paid to make assumptions about a person out of a bunch of personal questions. I think that job would be pretty boring. I would have to get intoxicated or something before going to work everyday, that tedious paper work would drive me crazy. that is prob. why people go all postal and shoot people at work - cause they have to do tedious crap everyday that has no bearing. I hope nothing pushes me over the edge of insanity. that would suck. it might not be bad though - I imagine the government would provide a pretty comfortable living for someone who was "mentally handicapped". I bet a few people have thought they were insane and really been on the same wave as everybody else. its crazy to be alive and conscious. consciousness gets dull - nothing modern intoxicants can't handle though, in moderation. joe millionarie was a gay show I resent that guy. I think I'm going to go smoke a cigarette. I can't really think of what to say. I need a cigarette to calm me down. that is not even how you spell "cigarette" but spelling is not even that important. I mean - its like this - professors and anyone else in my life has ragged on me about spelling and grammar. but they know - and I know - that they knew what the meaning of the word I misspelled. that kinda shit pisses me off. need a smoke. 
__label__label1 Well, I am wondering if I had read the instructions as carefully as I could have. The timer at the stop was unexpected. Convenient though. Although, I had planned to just look at my roommateORGNAME clock radio. It is reading 00:00. I am working on my day planner trying to figure out where my free time is going. College is different from what I expected it to be. I'm not sure what is worse knowing no one or knowing 0 people out of 00,000 undergraduates and wondering if I will see someone I know today. It could be worse. I need to try to call my aunt today. I tried yesterday, but she was not there and I really didn't want to leave a message. I really don't know my family in LOCNAME as well as I should. I wish I could go up to LOCNAME and see how cousins are doing up there. I have no idea where my roommate is. This is the 0 day he has not returned from wherever he goes. It is funny when I think about it. I wake up try not to make any noise then I realize I am the only one in the room. It is exciting as it is lonely. Maybe I'll do laundry today or something. I can't believe I actually like going to my classes. Perhaps it is because I do not have anywhere else to go. Human contact is everywhere, but I just want to feel welcomed outside of a classroom atmosphere. ORGNAME ORGNAME's ORGNAME just finished playing on the radio. The Oh Baby song just came on. I am amazed at what passes for music sometimes. Hip hop is not music. Rap is a joke. They don't even make sense, they just try to rhyme their words with the next line. I liked PROPNAME PROPNAME as a rapper, but I don't think he does it anymore. Clean rap is a thing of the past. Once it stood for something now it has shifted to image and jewelry. Sad. I am feeling a little tired. I have been sleeping very well, but sometimes I forget where I am. A moment of panic surrounds me then I realize where I am. 0 walls, 0 plain walls can be intimidating to wake up to everyday. I can't wait until we get those message boards up. Maybe we can add some character to this room. I am getting thirsty know. This dormitory is secluded, but it is alright unless I need to get something to eat or drink. I am not going to use all my Bevo Bucks on vending machines. From what I heard, they go fast while dine in dollars linger on and on. At least I am not in Jester. Almost done. Now what should I write about? 
__label__label0 I guess I should begin by saying I'm pretty tired today. I woke up feeling sort of sick. My throat hurt a little bit, and my body ached as well. The dorm rooms are really cold. I went to the financial aid office for some information but I don't even remember how to access what the lady told me to. I've been thinking a lot lately and worrying about school. I'm worried about this college algebra class I'm supposed to be getting into through ORGNAME. They said they haven't received my transcript although I know it was sent from LOCNAME on August 00, I even have the receipt. It pisses me off that ACC's records department is screwed up. This class is really important to me so that I can take my core classes next semester or so. Besides that stress, I've been stressed about PROPNAME. It doesn't really feel like we've been broken up. I know it's only been a week, but it doesn't feel like it to me. I think he is really more upset about it than me. My cell phone bill should be coming in the mail soon and I know my dad is going to kill me because it's going to be super expensive. The guy sitting next to me in this computer lab is typing super fast! He reminds me of the part on Meet the Parents" where he is at the airport looking for a different flight and the clerk types really fast and finds nothing. Makes me smile. Tomorrow I think I'll go to ACC's records department. I mean, I have a receipt that says I sent the transcript, so I wonder what kind of run around they will give me this time. Last time they were extremely rude to me. I mean, I'm new to all this, especially to ACC. It's not like I knew they would lose my transcript. The computer lab down here in the basement of Jester is pretty hot. I don't feel an air-flow. Just still air, and the typing of the guy sitting next to me. He just left right now. I heard him talk on his cell phone a few minutes ago about getting something to eat, which sounds good to me right now. I had some oreo's while in class today, and my friend PROPNAME was talking about how fat she is gotten, the girl is super skinny, not to mention in great shape because she runs 0 miles a day! But she was saying that oh my gosh oreo's are so fattening, yet she would kill for one. I offered her one, but she declined. I thought to myself oh my god! What is this girl thinking. All she talks about is what she eats and doesn't eat. It was kinda getting on my nerves, but oh well. I enjoyed the oreos and that's all that matters. I didn't feel guilty about eating them since I am probably going to go to the gym later on tonight. I wish I would have had some milk with those oreos though! New guy sitting next to me in computer lab. I hope he doesn't glance over and wonder what I'm doing. I guess I am pretty focused on my computer screen. I feel relaxed though. The chair is comfortable and my gum still has flavor. Still too hot though. I guess basements are supposed to be a little hot. PROPNAME just left me a voice message that she was going to eat some dinner and if I wanted to go. I hope she doesn't find out I am writing about her! I know I've said nothing bad about her, but I think she could get her feelings hurt. She is a really sweet girl and I really don't have anything negative to write about her. Besides, I don't typically talk about people. I guess I always put myself in the other person's shoes. I wouldn't want people to talk about me! Don't know when I'm going to go home. I miss everyone, but I really like my freedom here. Coming and going as I please. Not having to be home at 00 and calling and checking in. I like being independent. Not that I resent anyone or anything from home, but I like being on my own and all. It feels cool and I feel all grown up! PROPNAME's phone just rang and she is trying to be real quiet! She is so cute! I'm glad she is up here with me because I really don't know what I would have done if she hadn't decided to come to school here. We're really close and I enjoy that. Whoa, I almost thought I lost all of my work because a window screen popped up about some debugging! Scary!         
__label__label1 Stream of consciousness, I can't even spell it right, in any case I'm sitting here its 00:00 in the morning and I do not feel like doing all this crap today. too many classes when I'd rather just sit here doing nothing whatever its stupid anyway I feel like sleeping or some nonsense. nose itched. anyway I wonder what I'm going to do tonight about all that homework good god its exhausting I should taken less hours or at least not calculus that class it kicking me in the butt, I don't know anything. tangents. velocity. who freaking cares I'm no physicist, but for some reason to be an economist I need to know how to calculate velocity of a ball and decide what dosage to give patients based on tangent and secant line. honestly I don't care  I just want to get out there and keep going. chris is probably at school right now, I wonder what he is doing. oh he is in government, he better be bringing that C up to a B right now on that test. if he just tried he could be so much smarter but I distracted him and made him get the c to begin with, but its still his fault. damn nose. whatever. I just want him to do well on this one. I like it when he is smart but I don't always because I begin to feel inferior. in any case, I love him no matter how he is I just wish he had help himself more. he is working tonight, so we can do something this weekend, I paid like 00 bucks last weekend because he had no money,  its not like I'm rich. I work for my money I took out loans. my dad has not had a job since he got out in 0 months. I'm not rich. he starts his job on october 0 so that is really good because my family will be a lot better off. its quite exciting for us since we've had such little money for a while now. I'm not going to get stuck up because of it either. I wish someone would send me some mail  I check that stupid box everyday and I don't get anything why can't someone just send something to be nice  beth got a box and I still have not gotten anything. just a fucking postcard or something would be nice. oh well. ill mail someone something first then they'll have to write back, or not. I like my penguin picture, he is waving but he looks sad. I'm sorry penguin. thirsty. yuck. that cherry coke is disgusting, it tastes like carbonated water. gross and I paid 00 cents for that shit. what is up with my face itching while I?m writing this stuff. ooo. I'd rather be playing my game right now, although I really should be working out ill never be ready for thr PFT like this. can't do all those pushups and I don't know how fast I run. ill run till I vomit I guess. nose ITCHES AGAIN. I love chris he is such a nice boyfriend. not like those other guys who didn't really treat me right. chris is not perfect but he has changed a lot since the beginning of our relationship and madison and all the shit that caused. in any case, we are happy now and madison can kiss my ass. he asked me to marry him in a sense that we aren't engaged but we will marry each other, we're moving in pretty soon together,  I wish he had stop being such a mama's boy and tell her to get over it. I'll probably be the one that convinces her to pay for it and be happy about it. saves a lot of money and chris and I can be together. we fight and stuff but its never big stuff. my parents will be fine with it. my dad will take a while to get used to it but my mom will support me if I really want it. it saves like 000 a month by doing it this way.

__label__label1 This must be the easiest and hardest writing assignment ever. There is nothing easier in a writing assignment when context and grammar doesn't matter, but there's nothing harder when one has nothing to write about. OK, how am I feeling? Hmm. I have a light headache and my contacts are bothering me. Right when I wrote "light" headache, it started to hurt even more.        Anyways, in class PROPNAME did this statistical project or what not between people who are afraid of death are more likely to support PROPNAME. Then, people who are more terrified of terrorists are more likely to support PROPNAME. Hmm. I on the other hand, am not terrified of terrorist because I support PROPNAME and feel safe with his leadership. That's how I would see it. If you are not afraid of terrorism, then you must think that PROPNAME is doing a fantastic job with keeping LOCNAME safe.        Oh man, it's only been five minutes and my wrists are already starting to hurt. hmm, maybe I'll just type slower.         My eyes are bothering me. Man this really sucks that I can't use the tab button to indent. I don't really want to keep pressing the space button because I am lazy and my wrist hurts. Ok forget any form of organization. I'll just babble about nothing. My eyes are watery. I bet it's due to my stupid contacts. My nose is runny too. Hehehe snot is gross. I wonder when anyone will ever read this. Never. Completion grade. Yay! Ok what am I thinking. I am thinking that I need to think of something so I can type whatever that thing is that I think ok. This is hurting my brain. I bet this is great for my headache. Wow, nine minutes already. This looks pretty lengthy. Ok I am positive that no one will ever read this. I mean who is going to read 000 plus random thoughts. Wow I just felt pressure to make mine interesting and jestful. What if mine is the most boring writing essay. No way, I bet that there's way more boring-er people than I am. I am just so cool like that. hehe no not really. Ok ::sigh:: 00 minutes. Wow. Time just slowed down. Ok I'm out of things to think once again. I rather be sleeping. It's in the afternoon and I just had lunch. I want to take a nap. Like pigs, they take a nap after they eat. I'm a pig. Only one minute has passed. What is this assignment suppose to prove. That class is composed of 000 hamsters in an experiment. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind. I'm in a fishbowl. Who's not a fishbowl? I am getting very sleepy. hehe I just thought of those guys who use a watch to hypnotize someone till they fall asleep and they say "you are getting very sleepy" in this creepy tone. well I feel like one of those guys being hypnotized. yayayaya! only 0 minutes to go! wow this is the best writing assignment ever. this should count for %00 of our grade. it's only fair. ok ok ok what am I thinking? I am thinking that I should be thinking of something to think of. ha that was gay. I'm hungry already and I just ate rice and steak. man I am a pig. I just have a big stomach capacity, I can't help it. headache. snot. itchy eyes. 0 minutes to go. I would be so mad if this whole thing got erased. hmm I wonder what everyone else is writing about. oh no, what if theirs is more articuling and witty. oh well I don't care. I hate competition. ha-ha ut's the best place for that. oh my gosh the count down begins. we have seconds left ladies and gentlemen. After much ado this fun is coming to an end. I must say it has been lots of fun. 
__label__label1 wow I just turned on my music a little too loud. that really scared me for a second. let's get this straightened out a bit I'm so glad I'm listening to this cd it reminds me of PROPNAME, who I miss terribly at the moment. I wonder why he didn't call me back last night well I guess it was really late and he probably had stuff to do, his chemistry homework and stuff like that. I think it's really funny that his roommate's name is hank and he's Chinese, that's just funny. my feet are really cold even though I have on socks and my slippers I guess it's just that I always get really cold in hardin house I don't know why they keep it like a refrigerator in here. everything's going to be alright, rockabye. I like this song a lot. all her friends tell her she's so pretty, she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while. so LOCNAME has a foam party planned for tomorrow night and I think that's going to be a lot of fun, except I don't know, the thought of being in a room of foam really freaks me out. I get really claustrophobic, especially when I feel like I can't breathe, kind of like when I go to sleep and I like to pull the covers up over me but I always have to make sure there's a way for a lot of air to get in and out because otherwise it just freaks me out. anyways, I think it'll be fun but I'm not sure if I'm going to get in the whole way. I've been in a whiteout once, that one in beaver creek or wait no it was park city and that was so scary, I kind of think this would be like that except a lot closer and like in your face, and hopefully not as cold. though part of what makes me claustrophobic is when you get all hot and everything as well as not being able to breathe, like you feel like you can't get any fresh air like a breeze or anything. but I still really want to go in just for a minute to say I've done it. but PROPNAME was telling me about how people like do stuff in the foam, and I don't know I'm worried because mark is a LOCNAME which makes me kind of not want to go over there I wonder why he's been telling his friends about me I really don't like that because I really don't like him and I know he likes me but he's kind of crazy and obsessive almost, though he's really nice, it just seems like he tries way too hard. like too hard to be so interested in your conversation and be listening and just making that "hmmmmmm. interesting. " like too pleasant psychologist kind of face that makes me think he's like analyzing everything I say, like I sound stupid but he's just not saying anything kind thing. I don't know I just really don't like that at all. and I think he's a little gay. well maybe not gay, but definitely metro. I think it's really funny that I've spelled definitely my whole life, and it's always been wrong but I just can't retrain myself to get it right. kind of like weird or weird. I still get them mixed up because I know I used to always write it one way and it was wrong, but now I don't know which way is right because I can never remember if I ever actually fixed it or not. I think it's weird. weird. whatever. weird. that looks a lot more right than the other way so hey we're going to go with that. I don't know what I think about will. he's also a LOCNAME, so if I go to foam I get to see him but I also have to deal with mark, so that's kind of like a double-edged-sword-damned if you do damned if you don't situation. I got sick of the hyphens. anyways, I think he's a really sweet guy and all, but he's just so quiet! but at the same time it's like I'm drawn to him almost because he's a dry pledge and he's cute but not all at the same time, I'm sick of this song and I'm changing it this one is happier but back to will I just don't know what I think of him. or that. whatever. I am leaving cause I love you, I am leaving cause I don't and I'm hoping you will follow and I'm praying that you won't let me go. I want to know who sings this song, PROPNAME never told me. I still can't believe he made me all those cds on the night he left it was really fun to talk to bo yesterday, I really liked talking to him he seemed so lonely and desperate to talk to someone his own age. I miss bo. I could never tell if he really liked me or not, kind of like PROPNAME, because it always seemed like we had the same kind of conversation every time, like hey bo how you doing I'm good ok talk to you later awkwardness kind of thing. I don't know. scratch my neck. anyways I never really knew about that but I've always liked him, 0ven after he insulted the cake at my 00th birthday party, I can't believe he didn't remember that at all and I thought it was so funny that he was just completely horrified at himself. I love that story, it's almost as classic as the cookie analogy from homecoming my sophomore year when he and PROPNAME both wanted to ask me, and then after that when bo liked me and I liked PROPNAME and they were fighting over me. I wonder if it was right that I brought it up that last night we were all together that was so much fun I can't believe I actually stayed there until 0 in the morning and I'm glad PROPNAME never lit his cigar up around me that really would have made me mad even though I know bo really wanted him to, I'm glad bo didn't force the issue too much though because I would have felt bad but I didn't want him to do that around me I hate smoking so much I hope PROPNAME quits it'll kill him I think it's so funny that PROPNAME figured out that he was the guy that was making out with marry at the LOCNAME island party, I'm glad I wasn't there because I think I would have been really embarrassed. I guess that's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places. it's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea what they're doing. but I like not drinking, and I like feeling like I don't have to and people accept that. it's really kind of nice wow I only have like 0 and a half minutes left that's pretty cool. but I sure am getting there. two dimes in the telephone alright, no it's not easy tonight. good song I really do love this cd I wonder if PROPNAME is ever going to get me that nello cd, I really would love that. or maybe if PROPNAME could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it I loved that. he first played that for me outside of casey's house. what were we doing over there? were we going to a concert or something. maybe? I don't remember. ha-ha PROPNAME used to always say we went over there to see casey's brothers. they're so hot. but PROPNAME's married now. I don't like how I just sounded like a bimbo there I really am smart I promise. I feel really stupid in my world lit class though because I've never taken Latin and I haven't studied Greek, and I don't know I just feel like I'm behind the ball here on PROPNAME's inferno. I like the book a lot but I'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks. starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far. so don't make the wrong impression I don't want raffa to think I'm like stupid it's like in hagood's class though I guess I just have to learn when to speak up, it's like I'm wow that just interrupted me and I had no idea where I was going. . I guess I just get writing and I have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode. I guess that's what I have to do when I start writing a paper because instinctively I start editing myself before I even begin and then I just end up never really getting anywhere. well I'm done here. goodbye. 
__label__label1 Hello, my name is PROPNAME. I felt like I needed to introduce myself since someone will be reading this assignment, and I am not familiar with that person. Anyhow, lets talk about some stuff. Hmm, where should I begin? I was born in PROPNAME. If your thinking this is like a biography, then I think that you will be wrong. However, back to what I was saying. I don't really like traveling to PROPNAME, LOCNAME. I find it kind of boring because I don't have anyone over there that is my age. All of my relatives are much older than I. These people don't tend to interest me because they are always bogged down with the problems that they create. Lets talk about my uncle for instance. I will not mention his name, however, he was. I mean is a drug addict and is constantly in and out of jail. Why would I be interested in going and visiting him unless I wanted some crack or something? He is a liar anyways, and I don't like affiliating myself with those kinds of people. Speaking of the kind of people I affiliate (if that's even how u spell the word) myself with, I think that I accidentally roomed with a gay person this semester. Had to look over my shoulder to make sure he's not behind me or something. However, he makes a lot of homosexual remarks, and although he says he is just playing, I think he does it all too frequently to be playing around. Anyways, I'm sick of talking about him because that guy is more and more annoying everyday. Lets talk about my big brother. Now this guy is someone who has his crap cut out. This is the reason that I look up to him. He knows how to manage his time, talk to his gf on the telephone for hours at a time, go out on the weekends, and still get all A's! I have to admit that I am somewhat jealous. However, he does help me out and gives really great advice. When he tutors me, I feel like he teaches better than a lot of professors. Maybe this is because he has known me for so long and knows how I retain material. He is two years older than me, but I am tired of talking about him because he always hogs the damn spotlight. Lets talk about my boxing, because that always gets me the respect and acknowledgement that I feel is so precious to a person. I hated not being respected. It made me sick to my stomach when someone would cut me in line or throw a pencil or whatnot at me and I couldn't do anything about it because that person had a physical strength advantage over me. However, I put an end to all that crap when I joined the boxing team in the summer of my freshman year in high school. I learned how to fight the hard way though. My coach sucked and didn't teach me a thing, so I just kept fighting and watching fights and picked up on different styles and tricks of the trade. I adopted a slugger's style of fighting. The reason is because my foot movement was never all that great. My strength began to get developed when I began lifting weights in my freshman year, and it suited my fighting style great. That year, a couple of kids decided to mess with me, so I took them to the mat room (part of the gym in my high school), and floored them one by one. Man it was great, the respect that those fights generated was awesome. From then on out, word of mouth about those fights got me my respect. I didn't even have to fight anymore! But I kept on because I got too competitive and I kind of liked it. Currently, I'm undefeated in my hometown. However, I was just an average fighter when it came to the Golden Gloves. I stopped when I started college. That's enough of that. My father is the next person I want to discuss. He has worked his way from rock bottom, and I admire that. He slept in a car for 0 months and bathed in a nearby river when he was working in maintenance away (for a railroad company called ORGNAME ORGNAME). He helps us out so much and he's funding my tuition for college all by himself (cause my mom divorced him a couple of years ago). I still love her and all, I just don't agree with anything she does. She seems to have tunnel vision, u know what I mean? Let me explain because my time here is almost up. She is one of those people who will see something she wants, and direct all of her attention to acquiring that one thing, no matter who she hurts. Today she seems more like a stranger, cause I don't see her all that much. She didn't invite me to her wedding. My time is up. Talk to u later. Bye 
__label__label0 I'm thinking I don't know what I'm thinking. its like my mind is still working although I don't know what to write. I wonder how the keyboard  came into invention and why the letters on the board are the way they are. my history class will be more difficult than I anticipated, my instructor really seems to know what he is talking about. I wonder if he's married, I think if he is married he probably has a very attractive wife. I knew a guy at my high school like that, he was sort of feminine but attractive girls were attracted to him, I never understood it. he was friends with the craziest people. PROPNAME had a death wish. he never understood the value of life or he understood it completely and wanted to live it at the very edge. I wonder why the timer isn't working. I thought a timer was counting down when PROPNAME did this site as an example in class. I'll just stop the timer when 00 minutes have elapsed and count it myself since this fucking site is obviously not working. I hate computers. I hate computing. computing is going to be a bad class that I am not looking forward too. LOCNAME is a beautiful campus. I like the way all the sidewalks are shady and all the buildings are very rustic looking. I want to get a bike so I can ride to psychology quickly on Mondays because its a pain in the ass walking all the way there and all the way back with nothing to go to before or after. I'm worried about kaitlin. I think she will be fine and not get hurt or killed but I think war might change her in some way. she says she is ready to die for her country but she still has doubts about the validity of the war which could wear down on her morale as she is in a foreign place with strangers. I hope she can find something over there to keep her interest or just keep her going. Iraqi sandspiders are the scariest fucking things I've ever seen in my life. if a sandspider attacked me I would probably try to kill it and then be traumatized for the rest of my life. rishi is making a weird ass noise. like breathing when you are lifting weights or something. brian is my best friend and he almost died. it is very scary to think that someone my age and so close in all aspects of life to me can die. I am 00 and invincible or so I thought. this must change the entire way he views life. don't treat it as something to take for granted. it is definitely a gift and some people just don't understand that. they either die young or never appreciate what they have which is almost worse. I need to get a rug our room is dirty. I'm looking around to spur my thoughts when something goes on for too long. I like the way the window faces north. I can see almost the whole campus and its pretty in the morning. I want to buy a hang glider really really bad. what is my fascination with flight, it must be something deep in my past or the fact that my dad was a pilot I don't know. I hope I didn't choose the wrong career path with the one I have chosen not really offering me much of a chance to fly unless I become moderately rich. I hate that the common man cannot fly his own vessel, even though the commercialization of flight is just about the coolest thing ever. I wonder what sort of experience it takes to becomes someone who works at the airport. that might be a fun job. maybe even just working in the fucking coffee shop would be cool because you get to meet lots of people from all over the world. Austin is a cool city. I think if my job permits me, I would like to stay here for a good portion of my life. I also want to live outside the LOCNAME for a while. in a country that has ancient cultural significance. maybe LOCNAME or LOCNAME or LOCNAME. that would be the shit. I feel like stretching. my back always needs to be stretched after I wake up. I wonder why that is. ok so the timer should have reached 00 minutes by now so I will hit submit. 
__label__label1 The crotheres computer lab is perhaps one of the worst on campus, but I don't really know since I have been to only three. I'm real glad that I got into the college of communications. Its unfortunate, however, that I can't spell worth anything. Jeez, I hope this writing assignment is not graded on spelling or grammar or any of that sort of nonsense. Why is it oh so hot in here? honestly, every other building on campus is freezing, but in here, I just want to wear beach clothes. I remember when I went to the beach for the first time in my life. It was this past summer. LOCNAME LOCNAME. Oh family vacations. I hope my mom and pop are doing ok at home. Since I'm gone they only have each other to yell at. no more marjon for yell fest 0000 at the rostami household. Good people. They just need to get out more. This keyboard kind of sucks too. Some of the keys get suck and it is oh so inconvenient. There we go with the spelling again. In the eighth grade my English teacher once told me that spelling is not a sign of a gifted student. At the end of the year she gave me the award for best student. Yep. English has always been a good one. I hope I make the staff of the daily Texan. They emailed me today and told me that I had to write another column. Can't they tell just how amazing I am from only one column? I guess not. I need to be more creative. Creative like all those communication kids. I'm ONE TOO!!! YAYAYAY! Yes sir, all the cool kids are communications majors. AT orientation a radio station person told me I was a cool kid. This city makes my face break out big time. My skin is horrible, and I hate having to scratch  my skin when my fingers have been typing and I most obviously have contracted all sorts of bacteria that I am now rubbing on my face. OH my face. The communications kids I interviewed with today (the Texan) had bad skin too. I think I'll fit in swell with them. If I just get in. OH man oh man oh manoh man. I really hope I make the staff. I find out on Thursday. I also have to submit another column by Thursday. I had a teacher once who had really long nasty nails and a nose ring (those weren't common until a few years ago. then everyone started getting them, including white kids. I am white. My people are from the caucus mountains and you just don't get any more caucasion than and Iranian. again with the spelling. and again with the messed up keys. I should have just gone to use the computers in the ugl or the cma or cmc, whichever one has computers. I thought not having a computer would be a major hassle, but it is pretty decent so far. knock on wood! My hands are dry. That's another think about this city, it makes my skin dry. Maybe that's why my skin is breaking out so hardcore-because it is so dry that it is producing more oils to balance out my skin tone but it just proves to be detrimental to my skin. Oh shoot. I never cared about my appearance. I was the homecoming queen. Me. not some "popular slut. " Man, there are so many sorority girls in this school. At the beginning of school I mistakenly walked through the area in front of the ugl and walked through a mass of girls who all looked the exact same!! WHERE IS YOUR IDENTITY LITTLE GIRL? they have none. My phone just vibrated. It could be my mom. she calls a lot now that my sister and I are out of the house all she has to talk to is my pop, and well, he is not one to talk. LAME. Or it could be some fool from my high school warning me of the fat pagan. I hate her, if it is one person who I hate it is jenny pagan: my theatre teacher for 0 years and I had her twice a day. YUCK! PROPNAME I hate her. I'm going back home on the 00th to crown the new queen and I might have to see her and a whole lot of people I don't want to see for the rest of my life. Including PROPNAME, the king. My ex best friend, and my ex boy friend. (again with the spelling, I do realize all that is one word, but I am hesitant to go back an change it because I am at 00 minutes and 0 seconds right now. I love this kind of writing, we should do it all the time, always. PROPNAME used to always say that. A good man, that PROPNAME PROPNAME. Too bad some girl named PROPNAME had to go and taint such a good man. I had a lot of friends who were boys in high school, but not in college. Maybe that is because I live in PROPNAME. Ladybugs! oh man, I like to steal the doormat and put it in front of other peoples doors. ha jokes on you 
__label__label0 this is raechal collins. my feelings are good right now. I think I am going home this weekend for the first time since I've been up here. I don't know if it is for sure yet, but I'm excited to see everyone that I haven't seen in a while. my roommate is in a bad mood because she found out her ex boyfriend is dating a junior in high school which is just gross. also, one of my best friends from high school isn't very happy. I don't know why but she just doesn't seem happy. my absolute best friend in the world is coming down this weekend though so I might be staying in LOCNAME for that. I just want to go home to see my boyfriend, or whatever it could be considered. I'm waiting for him to write me back right now. even though I can't really write him back because I'm writing on this thing for twenty minutes. I'm excited about this class. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. it's by far my most interesting one, next to swimming. I'm excited for that one cause it will be a good form of exercise and I need a way to get some exercise up here. since all I seem to be doing is eating. I wonder how everything is back home. it's really hard to do the long distance thing, but its weird how they say time apart can make the heart grow fonder, when all it has done to me is make me grow more detached. in a way, I guess it is good, but at the same time, it's kind of sad, because if I was home right now, everything would be the same, and we would be together. except now I'm here and I need to branch out and meet new people. I'm also doing this sorority business and I really don't know if it's meant for me. I like it, but I mean it seems like its just girls who join a group to get "sisters for life" and I don't know if it is something I want to spend all my time and parent's money doing. I never realized how much things coasted until I came here. it is absolutely insane. now I have to actually keep track of my money and its so hard. I had no idea how much I spent a month. I hate my anthropology class. it's hard and I don't understand what's going on in there. also my teacher is blind which is really cool and respectable but its almost distracting because I find myself staring at his guide dog or wondering what he's feeling since he is standing in front of a class of 000 plus and he can't see them. for all he knows we could be throwing stuff leaving class eating drinking and being absent. my friend is being shady and trying to rub in getting her third choice sorority when my other friend got first. it is weird. we have to figure out where I am living next year. it is kind of stressful because every body knows where they are living and I don't have a clue cause I haven't thought about it once. tomorrow night I am going to the ato pledge line. it should be fun a lot of my guy friends went ato so I like hanging out with them. I like my roommate jen. she is a badass and we all have fun. I also like PROPNAME, my other roommate. actually they are both my suite mates my roommate is PROPNAME from high school. it made it easier moving in and stuff with a roommate I already knew. I would have hated moving in a finding that my roommate was someone who didn't speak English or like hated life or something like that. this twenty minutes is lasting longer than I thought. I didn't expect to write this much. PROPNAME and PROPNAME is playing in my room right now, and I love this movie. I haven't seen it in forever either. I remember when it first game out I was obsessed with PROPNAME deception. now in real life, he is not at hot as he used to be. he just killed himself in the movie. the ending of the movie/play is very depressing, and my arms and wrists are starting to hurt with all this typing. I need to pick out an outfit to wear to the ato thing tomorrow night. I guess I'm supposed to wear a cocktail dress. I don't want to get all dressed up. I've done enough dressing up for the past week during rush. welp, the twenty minutes is over, it was nice talking to you computer. 
__label__label0 well I'm sitting in the library doing the writing assignment for psychology class. This is really fun. I just finished writing down my notes for astronomy class because I have a quiz in there on Thursday. I went home this past weekend. Nothing really exciting happened. I visited with my family for memorial day. My cousin was nominated for homecoming queen. Wow. Not. Anyway yeah. I'm back now. It was weird having to pack to go home. I saw a movie over the weekend, wicker park was the name of it. It was really good. I thought that it wasn't going to be that good but I really liked it, it was a love story and I'm always a sucker for those. well the time is going by really slowly. I want to get back to my room so I can watch my favorite TV show of all time. Big brother. it's almost over so it's getting exciting. I don't think I spelled that right. O well. This is the easiest assignment I think that I've ever been assigned. Wow. 00 min is a really long time. I still have 00 more minutes to go. ummm. I've been in the library a really long time. And I still need to finish the pre-screening survey for this class so I can get experiment credit. I'm really tired. My friend PROPNAME is sitting next to me. She already did the assignment. I wish I was in my bed right now. I'm always tired these days. I'm liking college so far. I miss home sometimes and it seems like I miss it at the weirdest times but I think I'm adjusting pretty well. At least I think so. I left my medicine at home so I'm having trouble breathing. But my mom is sending it to me so I can feel better soon. I have to go to a ORGNAME football game for an assignment in my freshman seminar class but I didn't buy a sports package which by the way I think is the stupidest think I've ever heard of. I think if you're a student then you should be able to get into the game for free but what do I know. Anyway so I need to find somebody with an extra ticket that they want to give me. um I like all my professors except my freshman seminar prof. He picks on me because I'm quiet and I don't talk much. I hate when teachers do that. It really bugs me . I like listening to people talk. O man I still have 0 min to go. Blah blah. um a little while ago this guy was sitting next to me and he kept farting. It smelt so bad. Luckily he left because I don't think I would have been able to take it much longer. well now I can't think of anything to write so maybe I'll sing a song. "on Monday I'm waiting, Tuesday I'm fading and by Wednesday I can't sleep. Then the phone rings I hear you and the darkness is a clear view because you've come to rescue me". That was PROPNAME PROPNAME. I like her because she has the same name as me even though she doesn't spell it the right way. That's ok I guess I can forgive her. I like her sister, PROPNAME, too even if she is a dumb blond sometimes but at least she's herself unlike so many other people I know that try to copy what other people do and they can't come up with a unique thought if their live depended on it. Well I only have 0 minutes left. Thank goodness. It seems like I've been typing forever. Well my hand are getting tired of typing and I keep misspelling stuff so I have to keep on pressing the backspace button and I'm really tired. I've already said that but that's all I can think of right now. My eyes keep wanting to close. Good only one more minute and then I'm going to go and take a nap. O wait I can't. I have too much reading to do. That's all I do these days is read, read, read, and then I read some more. bye         
__label__label0   Okay I was asked to write about the way that I'm thinking this is an pretty easy assignment, but then comes what am I suppose to write about and is it really that easy to put thoughts to paper. I know one thing is I sure do really want to go back to houston where life was much easier and fun. Here people are to damn concieted and full of them selves, theis mainly means the females, maybe its cause I'm hispanic or something. Either way I never had diffulty meeting girls. Well its probably cause I miss my gurl my lil china back in h-town. PROPNAME what else mann I'm bored and tired and I wonder why my led hurts. Its been doing that all week. I'm not as athletic as I use to be that makes me sound like an old person. But foreal though its so boring out here parties are bunk. Who the called me today have no idea who was that girl I wish I knew who she was thought she sounded reallly good though. Lets see what else is there to say I don't really feel like college has got hard yet but I feel it coming. I hope I'm ready when all the hard works hits me BAAaMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!  Just like that. I realize that I do think of gurls a lot that's crazy even right now I'm talking about gurls haaaa. Hmmmmm will I meet a girl out here who will at least be my friend. Maannn this stupid computer is slow and these dum pop ups keep coming up man I didn't realize that 00 min was this long man I forgot how to type fast so ill just use this as practice I guess. Soooooooo lets see Wow there sure is a lot of porn online stupid popups trying to distract me all the time just leave me alone like micheal jackson mann that guys weird I feel srry for those kids lol. no but really that's sick I'm on 00 min and 00 sec. hmm doesn't seem like I said a lot so man I really not liking austin if this continues I'm going back home. I don't kjnow though I got freedom here like I would have in houston there I got a person watching me which is goood but how willl I ever grow without learning on my own. I actually learned how to wash clothes out here that's a big accomplish ment seein that I never did that. Yep I can a lot if I put my mind to it those white kids won't know what hit them when I get all my grades up and start knowing more people imma take there gurls lol. Then every body willl be on my swangers foreal  mann those cookies smell good but if I take my hands off the keyboard then ill stop typing and that's no good screw it let me get a cookie.

I need some music its so boring and what kind of crap do they jamm down hurrr its so weak and so is the dancing. yup good old h-town inned to go back and chill with my friends and especially PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME man forreal though I miss her most of all its like when I say I miss houston I mean her cause she's the only thing worth going back for. maybe in the future if it was meant to be ill meet here again and well fall in love all over agian!  I wish but she's beatiful she wouldn't be single and she's just perfect. I heart her. 
__label__label1 It seems like everyone has gone home for Labor Day weekend. Lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good. We had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. I really don't normally like mashed potatoes but I always just get them anyway. A couple people started playing Coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key. Procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class. The more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be. This dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us. At night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance. They tend to yell and be extremely loud. Our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow. It would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off. There are so many more months before the semester is over!  I'm sure it will go quickly though. Twenty minutes seems like a long time right now. I still have to go to ORGNAME today because we're completely out of snacks in the room. I'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me. Our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch. I've been watching way too much of "The Real World" in the past two days. They've been playing reruns nonstop since like Wednesday. This week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because Monday and Wednesday are my busy days. I want to get out of the city next weekend. Maybe I'll go visit some friends at LOCNAME LOCNAME or go to the lake. I haven't been swimming in really long time. I remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than I remember swimming in my own pool. Maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time. Our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make. The trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but I never once got stung. The lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out. Well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because I'm over half way done. The game on Saturday was really fun. Once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable. ORGNAME didn't do very well. I almost went there instead of LOCNAME just because its close to home and my sisters went there. On the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home. I don't know why I bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when I have a computer sitting right in front of me. Its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book. I hear a lawnmower outside. I feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on Labor Day. My neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long. I should trim my fingernails. They keep getting in the way while I'm typing. I haven't seem a movie since I came to Austin. I don't even know where a movie theater is around here. Better yet, I don't know what is playing right now. I haven't seen any previews either. Someone must be sick because I keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway. People go out way too much. I can't go out on a school night without feeling badly. I always want to wait for the weekend. I'm sure that will change shortly though. This has been a very long weekend. I  think I'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.      
__label__label1      Right now I am realli thinkingabout buying a soccerball so that I can starttraining because I really want to join a soccer team. I did not go to the gyn todayso I thing I'l go tomorrow. My CD of the soundtrack of Queen of the Damn is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. I need to get a laptop ecause everyday I have more and more homework like whatI am doing right now and my chemistry homework which I also have to do online. I do not knw why I feel so tired. I think its because I am having too much homework. I really do not like the hot weather. I prefer winter over any other season in the year only because I like the gloomy and quiet weather. I am already getting tired of writing and I think I am going to go to sleep early today so that tomrrow I can go to the Gym and still not be so tired as today so that I can do more homework. I really miss all my family. I am so used to a lot of noise and laughter since I have two brothers and two sisters. I miss playing with my baby sister who is only three years old. I want to finish this so that I can start playing my favorite game, "The king of fighters. " Oh I almost forgot I need to call my family because I told my dad I was going to call them yesterday but I didn't. I am hungry. I need to go to sleep. I realy do believe there exists other civilizations in our galaxy. I don't gethow so many people can go to church every sunday and even n otherdays of the week. I'm tired of sittinglike this. I need to get a chair or my back is going to start hurting. The lyrics from the CD "Jaguares" are so amazing. It really helps me to listen to these lyrics because they talk about different aspects of life and the mind. If I was to chance my major I would change it to Aerospace Enineering because  love everything that has to do with airplanes. I think I am. 
__label__label1     The first thing that coems to mind is how much I hate the stupid popups that are getting in the way of my writing and slowing down my laptop. The man that invented those should be shot. Now I'm starting to remember what was said in class about this assignment. It seemed like a really dumb assignment to do, but I prefer writing for only twenty minutes versus actually drafting up some essay and spending hours writing and rewriting and losing sleep over it. There really isn't much too this, which should've been fairly obvious to everyone in class. Why is it that no matter where you go there's always someone really really stupid that'll ask the same question that someone else asked only a few seconds before them. If I was a teacher that would really annoy me. It would be fun to put those dog shock collars on those types of people, you know the ones that everyone growns inwardly (and sometimes outwardly) at as soon as they open their mouth because nothing good will come out. I actually really do like the psych class. The assignment is aggravating because I know that odds are no one will ever read this and I'm doing it just for my own amusement. I know if I cheat and just copy and paste something or bang on the keyboards for 00 mins, then I'll feel bad about it. Oh well, 00 minutes isn't that big of a deal anyways. I'm killing time until my boyfriend gets done with his project so I can talk to him again. My mind is trying to go into thinking about my bf, but I'm not going to let that happen. I know that most people have a hard time making a "long distance" relationship work when the distance really isn't that far. All the girls I've met left a bf in LOCNAME or LOCNAME. I wish that's how far away he was because I could go and see him on the weekends. Actually, if he was anywhere in the LOCNAME, then it would really help, but I knew what I was getting into when we decided to stay together. No more boyfriend talk. I start looking around the room to think of something else, but the first thing that catches my eye is my roommate's vase of big yellow flowers that her bf just sent her. That's really not helping. I keep thinking about something in Spanish, but I'm guesssing whoever might read this (I doubt anyone ever will) won't know Spanish so I guess I should write it in english. La ausencia para el amor es como el viento para el fuego: extingue lo pequeno  y the fuerza a lo grande. That would translate to, Absence for love is like wind for fire: it extinguishes the small and gives strength to the large. Sounds much better in Spanish though. Now I'm starting to remember that anytime Spanish comes up, everyone asks how I know it and when I tell them I lived in LOCNAME LOCNAME they always ask if that's where I'm from. That has to be THE single most annoying question. I've been asked so many times, too many times. And no matter how many times I explain I'm from LOCNAME, and my parents are 000% American, people still assume that my family must be Mexican. It's like asking an oriental person if their family is originally from LOCNAME. It's just stupid. I don't look hispanic at all. Everyone assumes too much. When I say I lived in South American, they all assume LOCNAME. And when I say no, then they think I must have lived in a hut in the middle of the jungle. But its not only the Americans. Now I'm remembering all the dumb questions I got when I moved to LOCNAME. When I said I'm from LOCNAME, they all said no you're not, you're not wearing any boots and a gallon hat. Or they'd ask where my horse was, or what happend if my horse got sick and how would I get to school if that happened. Plus I got all the dumb PROPNAME jokes. PROPNAME used to call me Bushwa instead of LOCNAME, my last name. Pretty creative though. I'm glad he's happy at ORGNAME 
__label__label0 Let's see. I'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone. This is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back. Not that she's not a cool person or anything, I just can concentrate better when I'm alone and when it is quiet. But that is almost impossibe here in Jester. There are always people roaming the halls making loud noises. Like right now!  Oh well, it is something I must get used to. Or I can do what I did last night. Wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done. I stayed there until 0:00 a. M. I guess I can do my work better at night. My fingers are freezing!  This room is so cold!  I haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane. I'm cold even when I go to bed at night with my blanket. I have to constantly keep a sweater on and I cannot wear shorts like I used to back at home. Aw, home!  I think I am starting to miss being at home. I called the house the other day and my 00-year old brother told me he misses me. This, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs. I do go back home on Thursday night, but only so that I can get to the LOCNAME airport Friday morning for my flight to LOCNAME. I am competing in a sports tournament for my church. I am playing flag football and running track. Another cool thing about this weekend get away is that I get to see the guy I've been dating for less than a month. Well, I've known him for about 0 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together. It's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 00. I went to a dance with him after that, but only because I didn't want to be mean. He is exactly a year and 00 days younger than me. That was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, I really don't care anymore. He is the sweetest and funniest guy I have ever met. I actually just got out of a 0 year and 0 month relationship a month ago. Me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend. A week after we broke things off, this new guy I'm dating told me he had feelings for me. I was so confused and didn't know what to do because I had just got out of a relationship and I was going to be moving to LOCNAME in a few weeks. But I'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself. Because of that, I decided that I'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy. We decided we'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves. My ex found out and was extremely jealous. It just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy. But oh well, that's life I guess. I am really glad I continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say. I spent every day with him until the day I left. I have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much. He is amazing. The only thing I'm worried about is that I'll fall too hard and too quickly for him. I mean I did just get out of a serious relationship and I don't think I'm quite ready for another one. That's the only problem I'm having right now. The fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to. But the distance might become an issue. It was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so I do feel a tad bit guilty that I'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex. But my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me. But yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ORGNAME. But I am definitely loving it here in LOCNAME. I enjoy all of my professors and classes. Having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough. In addition I am taking this psychology class, which I dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting. Other than that I have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations. I just finished the reading for that class right before I started this assignment. Ah, my hands are still so cold. What do I do?!  My ears are feeling very cold too. Must I wear gloves in the summer in my DORM ROOM?!  Or my bad, it is the fall now. Same thing. Today is the day for my mile run. Ever since I moved to LOCNAME, I have been running a mile every other day at the Gregory Gym. I absolutely love that place!  And it is so convenient because it is right next to Jester. Freshman 00 can kiss my booty because I am staying in shape!  I find that I've been working out more here than I was doing at home in the summer. I really love this lifestyle I have at LOCNAME. The whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming, but I do not feel like I am abusing it. I did party a lot this weekend, but I didn't drink or anything. People keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset. I don't want people to view me as a party girl because I'm not out of control or anything. Oh well. I see that this writing is almost up. That wasn't too bad! 
__label__label1  Wow this is actually a cool writing assignment. I would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what I am thinking for a 00 minute period. I have just gotten back from a meeting about the ORGNAME ORGNAME organization and LOVED it!  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing. I am kind of stressed out (but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes) just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved. Getting involved, however has never been a problem for me. I love to be involved in everything. Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue. I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions. I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I am beginning to get nervous just because I haven't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I've been away from home. I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience. I know that I am here to get an education, but it's obvious to everyone that college doesn't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career, but it's also a learning experience for life lessons. I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined.      It has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new, huge city, but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of "yey school is over" to "wow, my life is just beginning, along with lots of studying that I don't really want to do. "  My life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway. I know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has. The fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like I don't belong. Yet, the funny thing is that I don't really care or maybe it's that I don't know how to make the effort to fit in again. My first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that I've lived in for the past four years (even though I lived there when I was younger) and I feel like it will just be weird to see how my family's lives have just king of carried on without me. I won't really understand my mom's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school. My dad is perhaps the only one that I will probably still feel just about the same with because I am use to not seeing him all the time. My time is almost up and as of right now I am just really hoping that, even though I may not be showing my priority to God right now, he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction. 
__label__label1 I am sitting in my room watching the sandlot. PROPNAME, my roommate is here too. She's getting ready to go home for the weekend. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are both going home to. They offered me a ride, but I'm not going to go because I went home last weekend, and I don't want to go home two weekends in a row. Although I would really like to see PROPNAME, my boyfriend. He's at work right now and I'm waiting for him to call. The sandlot is on the part where PROPNAME decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard. I've seen this movie a thousand times, the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town. This is probably one of my favorite baseball movies. My favorite of all time is definitely Field of Dreams. I always cry in the end where PROPNAME PROPNAME's character plays catch with his dad. They didn't get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died. My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been, I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it, so I'm glad we are at least trying to work things out. He apologized to LOCNAME this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer. PROPNAME came over and they had a talk on the back porch. I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing. But apparently it went alright. I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that. I forgot to before. Actually, I just realized now that that's something I need to do. Probably should have said it earlier. I hope I didn't hurt his feelings. Oh well, like I said, I felt awkward about the whole thing in general. Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today. I was at the Union with PROPNAME, and I went to the bathroom. Another girl was going in just as I was, and this made my shy bladder act up. She went into one stall, I went into the other, and I just couldn't go. Well, she wasn't going either, apparently, so we both just sat there for about a minute. I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little, but then it stopped. So the girl pees a little, and I pee a little more, but I still can't go all the way. I guess she gave up, because I heard the toilet flush and she left, so I was finally able to go. I went back to PROPNAME and told her the story. We were cracking up in the quietness of the Union 0rd floor. We started talking about PROPNAME's engagement (again), which I feel guilty about because I am usually not the type to gossip, but it's hard to avoid talking about it. Before I saw PROPNAME's ring (which is her grandmothers, PROPNAME did not buy it), PROPNAME told me that it was 0. 0 carats, which is pretty impressive, but then I saw it, and looked at it closely, and it's not that great. Its color isn't that good, and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which I suppose PROPNAME either hasn't seen or is just pretending that she can't see it. PROPNAME just called and I told him I need to call him back in eight minutes. Anyway, PROPNAME is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement, wedding thing. She wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring, and she's looking at dresses that are 00,000 dollar, designer dresses, and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding. She doesn't seem to realize that the average middle class family can't afford something like that. But who knows, maybe her parents have more money than I think. Also, I don't know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement. She's only been with PROPNAME for about two months. I can hardly think about my future with PROPNAME now, and I definitely couldn't have thought about it after two months. The only thing I can say is that if we're still together when I graduate, I'll probably marry him. But I find myself thinking a lot that I want to be single, and I want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in LOCNAME LOCNAME, and if someone is going to hold me back from those things, then I have to wonder if that's the person from me. I love him so much, but I also feel like I might be holding on to him because he's my first love and all that. He's such a great person though, I hope no matter what happens, that he will always be in my life. I just don't want to break his heart, or have my heart broken. I hope when it stops working, it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends. Well, I have ten seconds left, so I think I'm going to call him now.   
__label__label1      I am thinking about how to write this paper. I can't think of what to write. PROPNAME is putting papers in her notebook I am typing the ring around te logo is blue. the ring around the logo is blue. someone just entered I would rather be playing music. PROPNAME says goodnight 0 minute 00 seconds. I'm sort of hungry. I think writing this makes me more hungry. I have so much homework to do and other responsibilities. I wish I had no responsibility at this point in time. I'm worried about psychology because the content seems too easy to take a test on, suggesting I'm understanding the full realm of the content or the full realm of my responsibilities in this class although philosophy is worse. I cannot imagine being tested over anything in that class. Astronomy is just about the most difficult class I've ever taken because it's pure physics and not really learning about the general properties of celestial bodies. I've got a block. I need to write more songs, I haven't been able to write fully in over a year. but I could never be nearly as good as the ORGNAME so it seems frivolous to even try. water I'm beginning to drift off. I really need to do my homework more often I have way too much. I need a cellphone. I think I'm the only person in LOCNAME with no cell phone. everyone assumes I have a cell phone. I can't even get long distance jessica just stuck her finger in my mouth. she didn't think I'd write that. or that. I'm almost halfway through. I'm sleepy. my girlfriend is sexy. PROPNAME offered to be her tutor. I'm running out of things to write about. the ORGNAME are the best band ever. bar none. they incorporate obscure time signatures and lyrics into the most influential sound ever, the only quesionable exception being the Velvet Underground. they were copied by many bands yet don't get credit for it. listen to PROPNAME's "The Sweater Song" and the ORGNAME "I Bleed". PROPNAME was even on their tribute CD. No coincidence. listen to any Nirvana song compared to any ORGNAME song. Nirvana usually gets the credit for creating the modern alternative genre, but it was the Pixies. the liars are pretty awesome too. same with fugazi. and the desaparecidos, even though bright eyes is conor oberst's creative offspring. but the best up-and-coming band is the unicorns. they're neat. 00 00. it's already nearly 00 o'clock. I don't want to go back to my room because my roommate is boring and I'll miss PROPNAME. and he'll want to go sleep when I come in, like he was waiting up for me. this is hurting my wrists. Party on the Plaza was a little dull. I realize that I can't truly ever write what I'm thinking because that requires me to give a physical aspect to something that isn't physical and the true meaning of what is being said is restricted to restraining par  
__label__label0 Today was a long day. I have been going none stop on about four hours of sleep. Chemistry 000, I have found, is really kicking my butt. I made a seventy on the quiz, but I think I could have done a lot better. Tonight I'm going to go see Shrek 0 with PROPNAME and the guys. I can't remember if it is any good or not, but I guess I'm going as an excuse not to do my homework. One day I will get around to reading chapter three in psychology. This weekend I'm taking PROPNAME to LOCNAME to go see PROPNAME and PROPNAME for PROPNAME's birthday party. LOCNAME LOCNAME is such a far drive from here. I think that it will take me about seven hours to get there but then I have to drive another thirty or so minutes to PROPNAME for the actual party. I'm going to meet Mom Sunday afternoon on the way home for a nice home cooked meal. I haven't had one of those for so long. Well, actually PROPNAME's mother cooked us fajitas and lasagne last weekend when we went to LOCNAME, but that is not the same as my mom's cooking. After the ORGNAME vs. UT game on Saturday, which might I add we kicked their butt, about eight of us loaded up and decided to go to LOCNAME spur of the moment. PROPNAME's parents have a house in LOCNAME. His dad works for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME as an athletic director. Hmmm. I am running out of things to talk about now. October 0th, is the Aubrey homecoming football game and my friend PROPNAME has to crown this year's queen so I'm going home for the weekend to see everyone. I miss everyone a lot but I don't as much as I thought that I would. High school was great but college is so much better. Although, I would have to say that even though I was the valedictorian and I didn't have to study that much in high school, college is so much more difficult. I think I'll probably change my major a few times too. I know for sure that I want to do something in the medical field with children but I have no idea what I want to major in before I get there. And would my phone quit freaking beeping at me so I can finish this assignment!  Ok its just PROPNAME wanting to know if I am going to watch Shrek 0 at Jester tonight at 0. I wish that I could have went to party on the plaza today but I had so much to do it was nearly impossible. I had a TIP mentor meeting at 0, which is when my last class ended but I had to cut that an hour in a half short to go to a TIP seminar that was about notetaking. Now how boring is taking notes about notetaking. That is almost as bad as the seminar I have to go to three times a week. Critical thinking is thinking about thinking. YUCK!  Couldn't the writers of the book think of something just a little more creative than that. I mean who wants to sit in lecture first thing in the morning and listen to a speech about what it means to be a critical thinker. Anyways, then I left the notetaking seminar early to go to Women in Medicine. The speaker there talked about how she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired. I couldn't imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see. I have 00/00 vision right now but that doesn't mean that I'm a good driver. I have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks. Two weeks ago I went to LOCNAME to go see my friends in a band and I ended up staying in LOCNAME until 0 in the morning. When I was coming home the next day I stopped and got coffee before I headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later I dozed off. I had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile. I can't believe I keep doing that. It is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree. My Dad called this weekend, which is odd considering he just decided to flee last Christmas and not tell anyone where he was going. He said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure I was ok. I'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream. The reason why I wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird. If he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too?  Maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future. . just kidding. Ok well here is the countdown. I only have about 00 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me. Ok my time should be about up now. Yeah ok I'm done. . The End! 
__label__label0 go back back back to the disaster . I can't get that song out of my head. It was so weird on PROPNAME's board I couldn't understands what it meant till I read it out loud I wonder if spelling counts on this and if you can go back and correct mis spelled words  like they care. I am so bored but so excite about the job I have essentially been doing the same thing for the past three years and I think that I can handle the work load but this is college and its suppose TO BE HARDER BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T BEEN I STILL NEED TO read some of the info in the art history book that girl pre adviser said it would be fun but so far it has been a snooze feast. what else to write about I though that I would have bad dreams after watching train spotting with the dead baby in the cradle but I really having been dreaming much probably because I stay up half the night hanging out with the hall everybody seems pretty nice and all the guy are hot especially matt oh baby but I think that he likes PROPNAME everybody likes PROPNAME she has that LOCNAME accent and she pretty and nice I couldn't even get drunk guys to dance with me on Saturday the only guy I danced with was p and then when PROPNAME said sorry to interrupt while we were dancing he said there was nothing to interrupt what a jerky think to say I mean I was standing right there it wasn't like he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying pritvi is funny but quite the little gossiper I really like my floor when they offer me a spot out side of supplemental housing I probably won't take I because I know so many people here and hopeful we can become good friends I haven't had any real friends for the past few years I been so involved in school but the weekends were so boring with out a school activity to do I seen a movie with a group of kids  twice one was after a school event and the other was after a church h think. I saw movies that I didn't want to see and it was pretty much like any other movie I've seen by myself but I remember them better I only have ten more minutes left I like to count I'm always counting things like yesterday I counted lance Armstrong bracelets 0 on the way to the theater building and seven on the was back PROPNAME's doesn't count could I didn't see it on the walk I am so bored right now but I am going to be so busy with soccer, broccoli project, circle k, and hopefully crew or rowing which sound the same to me but apparently with rowing you only have one ore and with crew you have two I don't know what else to right where is PROPNAME I so think that he forgot to knock on my door and just went off to lunch with PROPNAME. I can't believe he slept with jo I mean they had just met and a hour ago she had been kissing PROPNAME I mean if I was PROPNAME I would have been pissed what if all my thought were filled with profanity since I don't cuss I just thought about it constantly but I think cussing is stupid and you have to be a certain type of person to say certain words I sound so stupid when I cuss  
__label__label1  Hi. My nPROPNAMEe is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. Usually when PROPNAME have to write something I like to introduce myself first. I did not prewrite this I promise. I was born November 00, 0000 (PROPNAME day before Thanksgiving). I am now 00 years old and am excited about being in the college ORGNAME engineering ORGNAME the ORGNAME PROPNAME ORGNAME at ORGNAME as a Biomedical engineering major. I love to play sports (volleyball, softball, and track), write poetry, praise dance! and enjoy nature. Some things that I would like to do before I leave LOCNAME or before I graduate college are to go horseback riding again (preferably, to take horseback riding lessons), to go kyacking ( I don't have a clue right now as to how to spell this word), to go parasailing with a friend of mine and to visit the capitol and some of the musuems in the city. I would also like to get involved in a good service organization. I love service and helping other people. Oh!  About my family. I am the PROPNAME of PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME of LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. I have one older sister, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. My father works for a nuclear plant, my mother is a teachers aide, and my sister is in the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. She (my sister) has been overseas twice (yes, to LOCNAME as well--she said that where she was wasn't that bad at all). She has now been restationed to florida. This makes me really nervous sometimes because we are predicted to have a pretty bad hurricane season this year and many of them hit florida. She picked a bad state to go to. Anyway, I told my sister that she could go wherever she wanted as long as I could come and visit at least once (ha! Like I could really decide where she would go. I just thought I'd try it). She would have flown me to LOCNAME to go see the sites and to go see the pyramids in LOCNAME but my mom wouldn't let me go. She didn't want the both of us over there. However, I plan to go visit in LOCNAME either during Christmas break or Spring Break. My thoughts have now shifted to the PROPNAME family. This is a family or couple that I meet on a plane my eighth grade summer. I had gone to National Baptist Conference in LOCNAME and was flying back to houston by myself. They told my god-mother, who was with me before the flight, that they would keep an eye on me. When we got to houston we exchanged info and said we would keep in touch. Now, usually when this happens, people don't really keep in touch but in this case we have kept in touch for over 0 years now. We send each other cards, call each other and all that good stuff. I think that that is just amazing. What esle to talk about???? OK I am just getting words now. (Friends, other homework, love,Oh) Let me tell you about the home I would like. I was raised in a somewhat country area and I came seem to get awat from that. I would like to build a big country house with a large bay area window, sunlight roof in the kitchen or some area of the house, maybe a lake, and I know that I want horses, dogs, and cats. I don't know why but this picture always comes into my head when I think of what I want my future home to look like. Also I have to have a porch that goes all the way around with at least one swing on it and most definitely atleast one walk in closet. I don't know exactly where I would like this house but I think I would like it to be somewhere in LOCNAME. Time is almost up and this is about all that I can think of right now anyway so bye and I will see you next time. The one and only.   
__label__label0 Hello, I don't know why I feel that I have to greet you, but I do. and I don't know who "you" are, because I have never tried to communicate with myself. that is so strange to me because I should know me well, because I am me. So. a stream of conciousness, eh? lets begin with the first thing I  look at: the keyboard. it is black, and the lettering is in white, capital letters. I know each of these letters by sound, and sight. how did I learn these? with out them I wouldn't even be here doing this. now I am hearing things. people all around me logging onto their computers just typing away, researching away. now a man is asking a question to one of the information people here. I don't know who they are, like how to adress them, that is. but they are here to help. and for some reason that makes me feel at ease. at ease from  what? I don't know . I guess the world is enough to make my being feel uneasy. my existence in this world makes me feel like I need to be recognized, sensed, felt, heard, or loved. isn't that strange? why do I need to feel this way? I don't know. but that's how I feel. moving on- what is another sense? I've gone over what I am looking at, what I am hearing and what I am feeling. but feeling in an emotional sense, not physical. I could have said I am feeling the contact between my fingers and the keyboard, but instead I chose to elaborate on my internal emotions, and that is not one of the five senses. isn't that strange? so that covers three out of five. what am I tasting right now? well, I don't know how to answer that. I don't know how to describe the taste of my mouth. and even if I was still eating, how could I explain the taste of a hot dog or fries or a banana? the only thing I could say is that "my mouth tastes like hot dog, fries and banana. " but that isn't necessarily what it really does taste like right now. now it tastes like nothingness, I suppose. what does nothingness taste like? I could ramble off synonyms, such as void or empty space even. but that doesn't mean anything untill a person consciously experiences it. right? like when a person learns what strawberry tastes like. there is no possible way to explain exactly the flavor of a strawberry. mmmm strawberries are delicious. that's all I would be able to say. and now I am actually CRAVING a strwberry! even me typing the word, and the big capital way that I spelled "craving" makes me want it even more. I am now trying to take my mind off of the mouthwatering fruit so that I can finish the last three minutes or so of this paper before I leave to go get some strawberries. it is a pretty strong urge for me to leave now but I have discipline. and that is what makes me different from everyone else. I have discipline. I won't leave now because my grade is so important to me. and its paying off, you know why? because I only have 00 more seconds to go!!! I am very happy now at the hought that I don't have to type any         
__label__label1      Today is the first football game, I'm pretty excited. Idon't really know the drill so  hopefully my friend willcall. I wonder if there is a parade, that'd be cool I could go  listen to the band, I miss band band was fun if I don't make the dance team I'm  definately going to try  out for band, although my lips are so fat  I can't believe PROPNAME  said that about my lips sometimes I really wonder about that kid, he sure does tell  a lot of stories, I mean seriously he couldn't have gotten kicked out of new orleans  theyll take anyone over there, youd have to do a whole hell of a lot to get kicked  out of there I wonder how megans doing in alabama she found a new male friend I  wonder about her and jason if they are going to stay together they are one of  those couples that are going to stay together forever save a nuclear winter. I wish I  could be like that but at the same time I'm having fun I guess, I really miss griff, he  always made me smile even if it was something stupid, I need to go visit him at  atm I wonder how much different it is over there if it really is a bunch of cowboys  like I picture it I wonder if erin likes it since she's not into the whole spirit cowboy  thing, I think she would do so much better here with me! plus I mjust miss erin. she  was so cool I loved our no pants parties, they were fun bonding time. man 00 min  is longer than I thought suck town usa, I think this assignment is kind of cool to track  your htoughts for 00 min, it just proves further how random I am, I'm hungry, I think  I'm going to have a pb&j when I'm done, that's the stuff with strawberry jelly. strawberries whiten your teeth that is so cool I need to start using my crest white  strips again, I need to take a shower, man I forgot how far away kirby lane isthat  power walk made me all nappy. that's ok I'm sure ill get even nappier at the f-ball  game amin is so hot, man did I luck out on getting a counselor, nate was so cool  too! I'd totally date nate. that's the kind of guy I'm looking for, random funnyness  facial expressions everything someone that canjust make me laugh up a storm. OTherwhise ill get bored. I kind of want someone like griff though too. Although if I  dated griff I'd be really scared. Idon't know why, idon't htink he'd ever cheat on  anyone but he never wants a girlfriend. manhes good. really strong. he can bench  press me that's amazing I need to work out I don't want that nasty freshman 00. I  don't think ill get it I walk around campus like hardcore. its a big campus I like it  though I like getting lsot in it all its definately puts me in my place. which is nice. no  more trying to be something imnot. I hope I can find an organization to be in. the  wrangler darlins would be pretty awesome and pals would be pretty cool. I  wouldlove to get a really hot italian boy. man that would be cool. like hardcore  awesome. like paolo or davide or vincente that would be awesome this takes a  long time I'm having trouble trying to fill up the time I wonder when my roommate is  going to wake up its like 0:00 in the afternoon. PROPNAME take a nap I think I will. naps  are the greatest. I didn't used to like them but man are they awesome. especially  after reading philosophy, stupid philosophy its so boring but the lectures are cool. I  don't know I usually don't like to discuss abortion and stuff like that because your  not going to change anyones mind so what's the point in fighting because that's all  your doing is fighting I don't like to fight I think its stupid because your hurting other  people and not gaining anything from it so its useless hurt thatno one needs ihate  pain I hate to make other people sad I hate to be sad. good thing I like it here or I  might be misreable almost done 00  min and 00 seconds. sweet this has taken  forever I should be reading something or studying or something like that I want to  do well in colllege grade wise ireally want to make a 0. 0 at least my mom made a  0. 0 in really hard classes last semester now granted that's my mom and she isn't  doing as much socially as I am so she has more time to study, well actually she  workds all the time. I never really realized how hard she must have worked. its  college that makes you realize stuff like that 
__label__label0 I do not feel well at all, I wonder if it was the tequila from last night or worrying about a girl. Sometimes I don't know why I am still with her. Can you still have feelings for someone that you find annoying? Why am I doing this Writing Assignment now my stomach and head are killing me. I should have tried to pawn it off on one of my roommates for ten dollars or something because who wants to right about what "they" think, I'm more interested in what other people think about. I mean I alrdy know what I think about, its boring to me, what about the people I don't know, what do they think about, that's what I want to know. I know that girl down there is thinking about something, some psycologist needs to figure out how to read girls, that's what they should be working on, why learn about depression, figure out what girls think about. Honestly, I don't think a single man can tell me what a girl is thinking at any given time, half the time they hate you other half they love you and it can switch just as fast. What's the deal with that!  I am still feeling bad my stomach won't stop hurting, I think I need to get something to eat. I need to get feeling better cause I already have plans for tonight, and it sucks going out when you don't feel well. When I go out and I don't feel well, I get extremely annoyed with everyone that I am with. It's probably because they are having more fun then I am. I have noticed that school is obsessed with talking about politics, in every class I go to we talk about PROPNAME and PROPNAME. YES, 0 more minutes to go on the assignment, but too much politics in my opinion half the time it has no correlation with the subject at hand. In my Spanish class we had a 00 minute discussion about economic poilices, how does that help me with Hola Como estas? This assignment isn't bad, its like the people that have journals, who put there mind on paper.      
__label__label1      Well, I woke up this morning scared because I was dreaming! I think I was dreaming that I was being chased by somebody and I was running like hell!  My roommate PROPNAME woke me up because we were a little bit late to school and I jumped out of bed like I was on fire! I scared her just getting out of bed!! hahahaha! It was pretty funny, I guess!! Wow, it is a BEAORGNAMEIFUL day outside!  It's all cloudy and I hope it rains all weekend. The news said it would but I really hope they are right!! So, there's this guy that just got up and left. He looked maybe familiar but maybe not! He was wearing a red shirt and he looked kind of silly! Hahahahaha!!  Now this other girl just sat down to use the computer and she looks a little bit irritated!  I might be wrong but she's hitting the keys like she wants to kill!! I don't know. maybe she just type's hard. or something!! OH Yeah!  I had a good time in my math class today. I actually learned something!! It was pretty cool! You know, I come from a really tiny place outside of LOCNAME LOCNAME called LOCNAME. This place is huge for me!! It's like this whole library is the size of my town. All the people in it too. My town is tiny and there are a thousand people here!!! It's so crazy to come from a town that the population is the size of a full library! That's tiny compared to this place!  Along with all this walking in and out, I've never seen so many people get together at once and if I have, it was at my 000 student high school!! These 000 students were all four grades put together!  That makes me laugh because I feel like an ant here!! But that's ok. I will grow to be a big UT Longhorn!! Woo! Hoo!!  So,  I miss my little sister. She's 0 years old and I was like her second mommy. My older sister attends UT and she's been here for a while now! Back at home, It was only both my parents and my little sister and I !  When my parents went out I would have to take care of her and I practically did that all nine years of her life. practically!!! haahhahaha!! We all went out a lot so we left her with my grandmother or my aunt at times!! She was who I always came home to to play with!! She always wanted me to play with her and most of the time I did!! I would try to take her to all of my games in sports and all of my track meets!  She really loved to see me play!! She always wanted to play with my team and after every game . "PROPNAME, When I grow up, I'm going to play Basketball too, or volleyball and I'm also going to run track and throw the discus. Just like you!" Awwww. My baby wants to be just like me!! I think she's the one I miss the most because I grew up with her and she grew up with me!! WoW! She's so big now!! I can still remember when she was just a little baby!! Awww. my little baby! Oh yeah. and her name is PROPNAME PROPNAME just in case you wanted to know!  She's a very smart girl and I can't wait until she grows up!! She already knows what she wants to be. a Marine Biologist!! Can you believe it?!! She told me that!!! :-) 
__label__label0   When I got online tonight I was prompted with an instant message from an unknown person. The person, aka MuffinCheeseqn, asked me if they remembered me from last night. Last night! Last night I was with PROPNAME, my roomie, watching Shrek! I was totally freaking out. I was telling PROPNAME that I had a stalker! This "MuffinCheeseqn" kept telling me that they were beginging to get to know me better so they wanted me to keep talking to them. Talk about freaky! Well finally a message box came up stating that it was one of my friends that had played a joke on me. What a friend! It ended up being my roomie's cousin! 'Lil punk! Anyhoo, that made my night though. I've been over at my friend PROPNAME's dorm working on a computer science program that is due tomorrow. I've been there since 0! I don't like the first program and I'm majoring in CS! What was I thinking! They should have a major in learning the ABCs! Oh man its only been 0 minutes. Man, I think PROPNAME needs to be quiet so I can concentrate on this writing assignment! lol! So PROPNAME has some pretty cute guys in her classes! I've seen some although she has failed to introduce me to them! OO I just remembered that I need to finish the pre-screening for the experiment requirements cause I really don't want to write a five page paper! I'm not very good at writing papers. Obviously! I'm not very good at calculus either. Although, today I actually understood something in my calculus discussion class! I probably will have trouble applying it to my homework problems though. Oh my gosh. I have a calculus midterm on FRIDAY! well next Friday. I have to do some major studying this weekend. This weekend my parents will be out of town. It will be the last time my parents can take a vacation for a year. My mom just got a new job! Yeah for my mom! She's been really therefore leaving my mom was out of a job. So we were living off of my dad's salary which isn't enough to pay all the bills. Thankfully my parents savings saved up but still taking a little every month will eventually end in 0. My mom looked for a job for almost 0 months before she just got hired last week. She doesn't have a college degree so that made it hard for her to find a job. That's why she wants me to get an education. She doesn't want me to. PROPNAME needs to shut up! She just walked into my room. OH MY GOSH she's singing the Fresh Prince of Bel Air Song! lol She just read what I wrote. OH MY GOSH now she's playing her mello. She's in the longhorn band. She's a big band nerd. I was once a band nerd. I played the sax! Wow I have like two minutes left! Well right now I'm feeling. Hungry! Obviously my thoughts are everywhere! Good-bye! 
__label__label1 I am sitting here thinking about what I am going to eat . I am very hungry. for lunch i had a sala, some pasta and some soup, oh that guy was really hot . when I work out today those guys are going to be really hot too. oh god something stinks. i wonder what it is . I hope its not the person sitting next tome. what is that girl wearing she looks very tacky. when I go to my dorm later I am going to fall out. First I have to call my parents or they will get mad . this is a library why are people walking around and talking so much. I wonder why my roommate does the stuff she does, and why is this person talking so what is wrong with his hear okay it is really starting to stink. oh crap I'm supposed to meet my roommate for lunch but oh well it doesn't matter, this is much more important. Last night the ORGNAME music wards were so crazy, there were a lot of crazy things happening everywhere, I thought I was going to flip. I absolutely loved what PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME were wearing. I wonder when will Destiny's child get back together hopefully soon. Man I hope I did good on my Spanish quiz it was fairly easy I think. What classes do I have tomorrow hopefully easy ones because I can't stand some of my classes. i wonder what my roommate is doing right now. I wonder if my exboyfriend has a girlfriend right now. man when will this be over 00 minutes is a long time to just write about anything. ooh another hot boy oh and there is his girlfriend. That's okay I look better than her anyways. I wonder what my friends are doing in LOCNAME LOCNAME maybe I'll give them  a call when I have time. I'm so excited the first football game is this week what am i going to wear who am I going to go with Hopefully we will beat north LOCNAME. oh my god games mean after parties and after parties mean really hot football players too bad I'm only 00 I can probably still get into some clubs. the ones that allow babies. Man it seems like I have been on here for years when is this crap going to end. wow my stomach just growled really loud, hopefully no one heard me but if they did ohg well I know they are probably having the same problem. I wonder what my brother is doing I wonder if he quit the football team yet I told him he should just do track but he didn't believe me so that is his fault, but he'll learn they always do. I wonder did my mom send my money for my ATM because I know I could still use it Oh crap the time is almost up I thought my brain would explode 
__label__label0 I am sitting here in my dorm room trying to organize my time for the rest of the day and night. I have a lot of reading to catch up on. I have trouble sitting down reading for a long period of time. I would rather sit in a lecture and listen to a professor. That is, if he/she is interesting. I want to read and understand my psychology book, but for some reason I haven't been able to concentrate on it. I feel like I am behind in this class for some reason. My mom graduated with a degree in psychology. She loved it. My biology class is my favorite. My professor is interesting and the book is interesting to me too. I wish I knew what I wanted to be. I have so many different ideas and I can't decide right now. I talked to my mom today and she suggested marine biology because she knew I used to be interested in that. She also suggested being a doctor. I don't know if I can go to school for 0 more years though. Four more years seems like a lot to me. But I know I will do it. I just feel weird right now I guess because I am just starting. I am 0 and a half hours away from home. I like it here but I miss it there. I always have a lot on my mind and I think that is why it has been hard to concentrate on reading lately. Eight months ago, 0 days before Christmas, my boyfriend of 0 years, PROPNAME, was killed in a car accident. I almost didn't come to LOCNAME because he was supposed to follow me here and live in LOCNAME too so we could be together. I thought about that a lot the first week I was here. It is just really hard. This is one of the reasons I am being in my reading for philosophy and psychology. I've been doing homework all week making up for last week. When it comes to school work I love being ahead. Which is why I am doing this writing assignment a week in advance. I'm hoping that I will feel better when I finish this and I will be able to read 0 chapters and comprehend it. When I stay ahead in school I always feel so much better. I like to read the sections before lectures rather than after. I am the type of person that takes on big load and I tend to get stressed out easy that way. I decided that when I came here I was strictly going to concentrate on school. In high school I had a full schedule of ap classes, a job, and participated in athletics. I loved all of it but I decided I need a break from every thing else which is why I'm not working this semester. I worked 0 days a week this past summer to save up for spending money this year so that I would not have to worry about working. My parents are paying for my school and all my bills, even my gas so I don't ever want to ask them for spending money. I received some scholarship money from PROPNAME, UT from my home town. We have community scholarship that they give out every year. There was a scholarship made in LOCNAME name this year. I got that one. That made me feel good I guess. I like being here but it is just really weird. I hope I adjust to LOCNAME soon. I already like it a lot better than when I first move here 0 weeks ago. My best friend PROPNAME helped me move down here and it was hard when she had to go back home, but I am going to see here this weekend so that makes me happy 
__label__label1 well since I have this assignment in front of me it is obviously the first thing I am thinking about. I wonder if the fact that I have been thinking about doing this assignment will affect what I write down. it probably will. like, I knew this would happen. I was thinking as soon as we got the assignment that sex is always on my mind and since this is college, I think it will be ok to mention it. my back itches. I got a sunburn yesterday at the beach. I knew I probably should have put sunscreen on, but I am a procrastinator, so I never got around to it. I kept asking my girlfriend if my back was burning yet, and she kept saying "no", but I guess she couldn't really tell how bad it was. my roommate just asked me what we had to read for this class. I haven't really been keeping up with my reading lately. I skipped class today also just because I didn't feel like waking up on time. my girlfriend probably is not as smart as me, but most of the time she seems like she works harder than me. when we first started going out she never used to get mad at me for anything. now she is always getting mad at me for everything. she used to laugh when ever I would get lost driving around because I have a bad sense of directions, but now she just always yells at me and says "where the fuck are you going". I never get mad at her for things she does to me though. I have infinite almost patience with her. she lost a piece to a puzzle I have had since I was like 0 and all I did was tell her not to worry about it but when ever I do something small like step on her sandal at the mall she gets really pissed off and says "fuck PROPNAME, watch where the fuck your going, that fucking the second time you've done that shit". I wish she was not always like that but I still love her very much. we've been together for nearly a year now so I am pretty sure we can last if we want to. I have economics to do. 
__label__label0 I am currently thinking about how ready I am to go home this weekend. I didn't go home for labor day weekend because my girlfriend came here to visit me. I can't wait to see her and see if she is feeling better. She has been sick for the last four days. I also can't wait to drive my new car. I just got it this summer but I haven't been able to drive it because I don't want to bring it to LOCNAME. I wonder what we are going to do in Psychology today? I wonder if he is going to do another demonstration like he did last class? I just drew a blank and can't think of what to say next. I really want to go watch a movie this weekend because I haven't went to the movies in a really long time. I wonder what I will buy PROPNAME for her birthday in December? Probably some flowers and some chocolate and maybe buy her a gift certificate to get a massage. I wonder what she will buy me for Christmas? She said it was something I have been wanting but I didn't know I have been wanting anything. I hope the camera I bought on Saturday is going to be here this week. I bought the new ORGNAME DSC-T0 which is the credit card size digital camera sony makes. I can't wait to get it I have been wanting the camera now for six months. I miss my 0000 Camaro. I restored it this year and during the summer I went to LOCNAME and traded it in for a 0000 SS Camaro. Wow what a change that car hauls butt and is nice because it has air conditioning which the 00 didn't. I still have my 00 Camaro and I will probably be wanting to restore that one pretty soon. My dream is to be a Orthodontist and I can't stop thinking about if and when I will realize if this dream could be a reality. I know I have to wait 0 more years to apply to dental school but I can't tell if I will have high enough grades to get accepted. I really hope my ORGNAME class isn't as hard as I am making it out to be. I took Chemistry ORGNAME last year in high school so I would be prepared but I feel a little discouraged. I wonder what experiments I will sign up for in Psychology. I have been looking but I haven't found one with my interest? I wonder if my dad is really going to help me get a racecar because I have always wanted to race and two weeks ago we went to the track to see if we were interested and my dad said we probably will race next year. My father raced when he was my age and I have always wanted to follow in his footsteps. He was very good and I have seen proof from the programs that he was in. I am starting to smell the food I just recently cooked. It smells like pizza. Maybe because that's what I fixed. DUH. My eyes are starting to hurt from looking at the screen without looking away. I am getting really annoyed by the people living on the top floor. They keep making noise. It sounds like an elephant is walking on top of me. It is disrupting my train of thought. I am really hoping that tonight I can take a break and not have to do any homework.
