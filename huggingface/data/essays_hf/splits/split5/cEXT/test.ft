__label__label1 Well, I figured I should write this right now while I have time. I am really busy lately. It kind of seems like I have no time for myself anymore. I am trying out for crew. There are a lot of people trying out though. I think like 000 people are going for 00 spots. I hope I make it though because I don't deal well with failure. I tried out for the soccer team and did not make it, but that was a little unfair because I did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did. So now everyone probably thinks I just wasn't good enough when that really was not the reason. I was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill. Oh well. I guess it taught me how to cope with failure. But it really hurts every time I fail. I tried to get into the business school and was denied. That got me so mad. There are all of these total morons in the business school. I know because I take classes with them and always make better grades than them. But alas, they can do what they want with their lives they entered right out of high school. Oh well. I am still going pre-law so it doesn't matter. Unfortunately my roommate and a lot of my friends are in it, so it is a constant reminder that I did not get in. But I think that all of this just makes me a stronger person. I am trying to be really involved this year. I am lifeguarding for the rec center. It is kind of fun, but I kind of dread going to work all the time. I just seem to have a lot of things on my plate. I had a fight with my boyfriend the other day. I am not sure if it was his fault or if I caused it because of all the stress I am under. Oh well. I think that things have really changed between me and my roommate too. Last year we used to be like best friends, but now things are different. She seems to be really distant. I am not sure what is wrong with her. Maybe it is my fault. I am not around as much as I used to be, so maybe she just wants more attention and is finding it elsewhere. She also has a boyfriend, so she spends a lot of time with him, which is fine with me. I just feel like things have totally changed. She went to a party last night and didn't invite me. Weird. I think I am really different from most people. I always seem to put everyone else's feelings before mine. I just don't understand why people don't do that. Or maybe I don't understand why I do that. Like, I would invite everyone to come with me if I was doing something cool. But all the people around me just I think are selfish. Maybe I just need to find a whole new group of friends. I mean, I had my first day of tryouts for crew, which was a pretty big deal to me. And when I see my boyfriend, he doesn't even ask how I did. He totally forgot about it. That gets me so mad. He seems to forget about everything. He then says how he is a bad boyfriend. Unfortunately, I have to agree with him. But don't get the wrong impression of me. I am actually a very happy person. I am just going through a lull right now. Once I get into a normal routine in my life I think I will be a lot happier. I just wish that my family was here. My parents live in LOCNAME, and it is hard with them so far away. At least my brother is here with me. That makes it a lot easier. I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here. I never realized how dependent I was on other people. I always thought of myself as a kind of loner, but I guess I really am not. I like being around people, and maybe I do get jealous when they do not choose to be with me. I think I really need to work on the jealousy thing. That is probably why I am having problems with my boyfriend. He finally made some friends here, so he hangs out with them. I think I also don't really trust him. I don't want him sharing intimate things about us to them. He was asking me the other day why I back away from intimacy and am afraid to talk about it. I just don't like talking about it. I consider it a private thing, and should just be shared between two people. It is nobody else's business. But I guess since we are in college, that is the way things are. Sex is on everyone's mind. But it just doesn't really seem to be on my mind very much. I would much rather just cuddle that have sex. Maybe I am weird, I don't know. But that drives my boyfriend crazy. He want's to have sex all the time. I think that is a major problem in our relationship. Oh well. Well, I guess my time is about up. I now have to go to crew again. I should do good today because it is strength training. I am pretty confident about that. Well, I guess I only have one more of these to write. That relieves some of my stress. Actually this was pretty cool doing this. I could just write down what I have been keeping inside. Pretty neat. 
__label__label0   There is this chomping sound coming from my brothers mouth. He's eating cereal. Sometimes I am jealous of this, because he  has his own place with a kitchen and food and everything. Even  PROPNAME has his own place with a kitchen and everything. Someday  I will have these things for myself. My own life, with my own things. Like in Days of Our Lives. There will be days of my life when I  do what I want, with whomever I choose. Until then I must continue  doing things their way . Everyone else’s way, like my mom. My nose  itches. It is a very natural thing to scratch an itch, or itch a  scratch?  It is very annoying to itch. When I got sunburned, I  itched extremely badly. PROPNAME laughed at me because I was jumping  around in discomfort. I never want to feel like that again. Sunburns suck. I miss PROPNAME though. Even though I did not see her  much, I always knew she was just down the street. But things are  different now. That made it sad for me to leave. The fact that  she isn't down the street anymore. That was like a security for me. Just knowing. I am in a hurry to finish this assignment. I have to be in class in about half an hour, and I am nowhere close to where I need to be. Life can make you feel like that. Like you are never at the right point, where you need to be. Everything in never alright. That's and oxy-moron. Things don't  work that way. But things do tend to work themselves out. You just  have to keep moving to get through the bad stuff. I always want  something better. I feel like I am always in transit. It's had for  me to be happy with the present. At least I can let go of the past, now. That was an accomplishment for me, not to dwell on memories anymore. Still, I look forward to, and fear the future. I do know things are good  now. I am on my own, a little bit. I don't want to rush things. I am in no hurry to grow up. Well, not a big hurry at least. I do want the rest of my life to come. I want to marry PROPNAME, have  a house, and pets. I am going to have a rabbit. Maybe two. Kids  eventually, but not for a long while. The television is such a distraction!  I can get side tracked forever. I like how it takes me out of this life. It is definitely  an escape. 
__label__label1 WORGNAMEL, I PROPNAME'T LNOW WHAT ALL TO TYPE ABOUT, SINCE WE CAN TYPE ABOUT ANYTHINPROPNAME MY BOYFRIEND THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE I MOVED DOWN HERE THREE WEEKS AGO CAME DOWN TODAY FROM DALLAS, SO I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I WISH HE DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE ON MONDAY, BUT HE HAS SCHOO, ASLO. MY ROOMMATE IS ON THE COMPUTER NEXT TO ME, READING ABOUT EL ORGNAME, AND HER BOYFRIEND IS WATCHING ME TYPE. THIS COMPUTER LAB STINKS. MY BOYFRIEND IS BORED OUT OF HIS MIND, BECALOCNAMEE HE WANTS TO PLAYS GAMES BUT CAN'T GET ON A COMPUTER. I THINK THIS PSYCHOLOGY COURSE IS GOING TO BE HARD, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CLASS. FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLR IS A BIT TOO MANY PEOPLE TO HAVE IN ONE CLASS--HOW WILL ANYONE LEARN ANYTHING?  ALSO, THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT THING IS VERY STRANGE. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO STUDY ABOUT US?  I SURE AS HECK AM NOT GOING TO WRITE A RESEARCH PAPER, THOUGH. I HATE WRITING PAPERS!  I'M GLAD THAT WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL IN OUR CLASS. BUT I HAVE A FINAL IN MY PHILOSOPHY CLASS, AND IT'S ALSO ON THE LAST DAY. THAT SUCKS. I WAS HOPING I COULD GO HOME AND WORK DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, BUT SINCE I WON'T LEAVE UNTIL DECEMBER 00, THAT'S NOT GOOD. AT LEAST WE DON'T HAVE TO BE BACK UNTIL JANUARY 00, THOUGH!!  THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. PROPNAME AND I ARE BOTH GROWING IMPATIENT. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN TYPING FOR AN HOUR, BUT IT HAS ON;Y BEEN TEN MINUTES. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TONIGHT. ME, PROPNAME, LOCNAME, AND PROPNAME ARE GOING OUT TO EAT AND TO SEE G. PROPNAME PROPNAME. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO SEE THAT MOVIE FOREVER. IF PROPNAME DOESN'T SHUT UP, I'M GOING TO BACK HAND HIM. PROPNAME IS PLAYING WITH THE MOUSE AND IT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. NOW HE'S LAUGHING UP A STORM, AND IT IS ALSO DRIVING ME CRAZY. PROPNAME IS A PERVERT. O, EXCUSE ME, HE THINKS HE'S ROMANTIC. NOW WE'RE ALL LAUGHING AND TALKING ABOUT DON PROPNAME PROPNAME, WHOEVER HE IS. I AM SO HUNGRY. I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY, AND MY STOMACH FEELS LIKE IT'S GONNA CAVE IN. NOW PROPNAME IS TALKING ABOUT TACO BELL, AND I'M GOING TO VOMIT. I HATE TACO BELL, AS WELL AS ALMOST ALL FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS. NOW PROPNAME IS READING WHAT I AM TYPING, AND IT IS ANNOYING ME. NOT REALLY, ALMOST EVERYTHING HE DOES I THINK IS CUTE. I MISS HIM A LOT, I'M REALLY GLAD HE'S HERE THIS WEEKEND. HE'S FIXING TO MOVE DOWN HERE IN A MONTH, BECAUSE HE'S GRADUATING FROM THE ART INSTITUTE OF DALLAS ON SEPTEMBER 00, THE SAME DAY AS OUR FIRST EXAM. NOW THEY ARE TALKING TALKING ABOUT HOW NASTY UNDERSHIRTS LOOK. IF PROPNAME PICKS AT HIS FOOT ONE MORE TIME I'M GONNA SLAP HIM. NOW MY TIME IS UP, I'M REALLY GLAD. 
__label__label0 Well I finally got into this computer. I have been waiting in line for a while and I'm really not sure what to say on this assignment. My mind is going crazy because I really don't know how to use these computers but I did figure it out. I think I might have sent an empty page or two to you because I wasn't sure that I didn't have to press enter when I was through typing my name and social security number. I shouldn't have left this to be done for the last minute. This assignment is due today by 0 p. m. and I hope that they go through to you. I really don't know that much about computers but they sure are smart. Well the person who programmed these computers are smart. I hope I do well in this class because I would like to have a good grade point average when I finish school. There are only three people in my family that have gone to college and this includes me. I really want to show my parents that I can do well on my own and be ( I just forgot what I was going to say sorry!) I can't think of the word right at this moment but it will eventually come to me. I'm not really sure if this is what you want me to be writing but I will try my best to tell you what I am thinking. I am confused right now because I am thinking of many things that I have to do. I am behind in one class and that is philosophy. I can't really comprehend what philosophers are saying. To me, I think some of the things they say are pointless, but hey that's just what I think. Last night I was trying to catch up on my reading but I can't really understand things when I can barely read what they have to say. I guess I have to read it a few times before I really understand what they are trying to say. It's like they never come to a point until a few hours later. My back hurts, not that you wanted to know that but that's what I'm thinking. I am trying my hardest this year trying not to procrastinate as much as I used to in highschool but highschool is different. I am running out of things to say and I am just typing empty words on the screen because my time is going so slow. I have about ten more minutes. I will tell you what I am doing this weekend and about my apartment complex. When my roommate and I moved into our apartments we had a few problems with management and our "home". First we were supposed to get our apartment fully furnished but some things were missing and management decided not to tell us until we had to ask them. We were missing a couch and a few chairs. I really didn’t mind about that because as long as I had a bed to sleep in I was fine. But my roommate finds any little thing to gripe about. It's like she has to have something to argue about and someone to argue with, which is usually with me because I am the only one there. I do not know how her boyfriend can put up with her. I think I am going to live alone next year if things keep going the way they are going. Anyway, back to the apartment, our water was not working we had no telephone and a few things were wrong also but now that they are working I could care less about them. I am so tired, I haven't been awake this early in a long time. Well my twenty minutes are up and I hope this is what you wanted. I should of asked questions but I am too shy or maybe embarrassed to go up to one of you to ask. I think it's shyness more than embarrassment. Good-bye!! 
__label__label1 This is a stream of consciousness paper for my psych. class. That is the only class I actually enjoy going to. They have about a katrillion people in that class and it is freezing cold, but that's okay. Almost all my classes except for English have 000,000,000,000 people in it. There is a cute guy in almost every single one of my classes, or if not in class, on the way to it. That's what college is all about. That's why I came from LOCNAME to LOCNAME. New people. It's so different out here. I love my roommates. They are so cute, and have really cute friends. I have one that is my favorite though. That's PROPNAME. He's so cute. anyway PROPNAME is so mad that the damn computer won't work. I believe that is a direct quote. She want to go call PROPNAME, her lifeguard lover. Sometimes I think she's jealous because I found my little PROPNAME within 0 days of coming to the great state of LOCNAME. At first I didn't like it here, but now I love it. I know 000,000,000,000 guys, and about 0 girls. Today I got to go with PROPNAME, our fine neighbor to go wash his Rodeo. I got to vacuum. It was great. I love him. But not as much as I (secretly) love room 0000.  The bus rides have been hell, but we ride with the neighbors. I hate to stand up. I hate that almost as much as I hate not sitting on the end of a row in class. I think it's the extra elbow room that I get. I hate those desks too. I am used to having about 000 sq. feet of desk area. Oh well. Anyway, yesterday, I bought PROPNAME some boxer shorts. I gave the salesman a hard time because I didn't know any of his sizes. oh, well. I don't want  to limit myself so soon after coming to LOCNAME. I want someone to play with, but I also want some time to explore the great wide dating field. There is a nasty rumor going around the apartment saying that PROPNAME likes me. I think PROPNAME is an awesome guy, but I don't know how willing I am to give PROPNAME up. It has gotten to the point where everyone asks me where PROPNAME is, and what he's doing. Okay, I may talk to the boy but I don't know every single blessed move he makes. Now as for Dark LOCNAME across the street I would like to know. He is so cute and artsy and he is an avid fan of party girl. okay I think my time is up, so Ill say good bye till tomorrow. Thank you, PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label0 I am going to take 00 minutes to do this psychology assignment. It's the end of the first week, and I already have tons of homework. I am getting a little homesick. It's ridiculous. I miss LOCNAME LOCNAME, even though it is soooo boring. The phone is ringing, but I am not going to answer it. I need to go to a store and buy a calculator. If I keep busy, I won't get as homesick. I am watching tennis on TV at the same time that I am writing this. I have such compassion for PROPNAME PROPNAME with everything that she has been through. Oops, miss-hit. I miss playing tennis at home. I am doing laundry, so I probably need to get the clothes out of the dryer, but I don't want to yet. Bad call on the PROPNAME match. I am going to have to shower before I go to PROPNAME tonight. I've got a real bad headache. I need to figure out how to send and receive mail on my new internet service. Maybe I'll just unplug my phone, and use the existing ORGNAME just for mail. Great Shot!!  I'll go through the internet for everything else, but since everyone already knows my ORGNAME screen name, I'll keep it for the mail. My parents would be paying for it anyway, since it's on their account. Before I am done typing this, I need to get the unique number and professor's name and everything. I'll have to find it. This assignment is actually kind of fun. I'm really homesick, but I'll get over it sometime (hopefully). It's really hot in this room. Grandma and Grandpa are coming in, but I forgot when. I have so much that I need to do, that I forgot what it all is. My twenty minutes is up, I need to check my laundry. 
__label__label1 Today is the Friday before labor Day. My boyfriend is picking me up and we are going to drive back to LOCNAME. I am excited about going home. My suite mate is also going home this weekend. That is fun. Her parents don't want her to come back so soon. In one way I don't really want to go home either. I am going because I will get to spend time with my boyfriend. His name is PROPNAME-by the way. My room mate is sleeping. I kinda feel bad about typing while she is sleeping, but I have things I need to get done. One of those things involves typing. She has been really mood lately as far as people being quite. She needs to understand that living with three people is hard. I have PROPNAME from PROPNAME on my desk. I got her from my boyfriend. I collected all of the ORGNAME's toys. I had all the characters from LOCNAME except PROPNAME. I don't remember why I mentioned that to him, but he went to an Antique store and found PROPNAME!  It was really sweet. He gave it to me when I was sick. We have a really good relationship. It is really hard being away from him. We have only been dating for three months, but we have spent every hour of every day of those three months together. There was only one day we spent apart. He went to his dad's house. He went there early in the morning. I was really tired that day. I don't remember what I did but I was tired after. It was a long day with out him. I think my friends started to feel neglected because I was spending so much time with PROPNAME. Most of them understood. I did make time for them-but just not as much time as  I was spending with them before PROPNAME and I were together. My friend PROPNAME and I got into a big fight because I was spending so much time with PROPNAME. That was part of the problem. The other part of it was that she stopped taking her Prozac. Bad move. She really upset me. We going in a fight at 0rd period and I was crying at 0th. I went to talk to a friend of both mine and PROPNAME's about the situation. PROPNAME showed up and started yelling at me even more. I was none too happy. PROPNAME told me that PROPNAME was under alot of stress because of family problems and other things. I didn't understand why she couldn't be happy for me. Jonathan was my first real boyfriend. PROPNAME has gone through many. I am always happy and supportive of them and her relationships. For once I wish she could do the same for me. It has all worked out now and PROPNAME and I have talked. We are friends again. That is good. I hate it when people are mad at me. I do not do well with enemies. My mommy always taught me to never make enemies. I still call my mom mommy. I don't know why. It is just one of those things. One of PROPNAME's friends would tease me about that. That's OK. I'm well over that!  I have my next class at 0-0. I don't know what I will do until then. I think I might do some of my work-but that is not likely. I think I will return some e-mail and stare at the walls. I'm good at that!  It's my hobby, next to sleeping!  Until next time I have to type-I think I will go now!   
__label__label1 I’m in my apartment with my new desk, everything is finally getting organized. I feel like this year will be a good one, I am not the same person that I used to be. I feel so much more secure. sure there were times when I would see people gathered in a huge group and think to myself that I wanted to join and be a part of it but when it comes right down to it, I am the kind of person who likes to have a couple of really close friends and then a lot of friends who I can say hi to and visit with on occasion. I really believe that that is okay. my boyfriend and I are great, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I don't need to be with him all the time so we enjoy each other's company a lot when we are together because it is not so often. he sees me in a totally different light this year and I feel the same way about him. I wonder if PROPNAME is having a good time tonight with Ira. I think that she is trying to convince herself that she doesn't want any relationships with guys. I wonder if it bothers her that PROPNAME is here. I hope not but I am not going to ban my boyfriend from coming to the apartment just because she doesn't have someone to come see her. I hope that isn't horrible. PROPNAME is going really well. it's going to be a really busy year I can already tell but I think that I can definitely handle it this year, I have the right mind set. the meeting last night was way to long though. who wants to sit in a chair for three hours discussing what seems like today as absolutely nothing!!! it was crazy. so many times I wanted to jump out of my chair and leave the room but I sat there and listened to all of the nonsense. this sorority thing is driving me crazy. on the one hand, it has the potential to be a lot of fun, on the other hand it is a huge time commitment and I am not sure if I want to put myself into something that leaves little time for anything else, on the other hand the old PROPNAME wouldn't get involved at all because she would be too nervous. I don't want to be that PROPNAME anymore. I never realized how hard it would be to write for twenty minutes. I feel like I have said a lot and it has only been ten minutes maybe. my boyfriend is in the other room studying, ha he has to go next. my classes are good this semester. history is going to be boring not because I hate the subject but because I am more interested in a discussion class and 0000 to the Civil War is so long ago and I feel like I studied it to satisfaction in high school. last year at LOCNAME I remember thinking it would be fun to study history again and I was irritated that as a freshman I couldn't take the class, look how times change. I think I am more organized this year than ever before in my life. my walls need paintings though or at least posters, I wonder where I can get cheap ones. I want to buy those glow in the dark stars and planets for my walls too. I think those are great. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. I hope he does better at school this year than he did last year. I am sure he will. he seems to have more control over himself this year. I can't believe he is taking drivers ed. how weird. I am so tired right now. I have so much reading to do. I am not going to sleep until it is all done, I must be prepared this year. I can stop thinking about some song where it says that the hardest to learn is the least complicated. it's hard to learn to study but once you do your life is so easy. I am going to learn that this year. that was an indigo girls song. what a fun concert. I wish they would come back to town. how great it was seeing PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I can't believe I didn't see PROPNAME there. I missed her this summer. she and PROPNAME will work well together I am sure. I am glad he is working at PROPNAME it will be nice spending time with him in that setting. 
__label__label0 Okay, so we're supposed to write for twenty minutes about nothing really. It's a show about nothing-Seinfeld. That is an episode for all you non-Seinfeld watchers out there. You really should watch it though. It is really funny. I like funny. Funny is good. I am trying to type fast without looking at the keys and it is not working. PROPNAME thinks she's so cool cause she typed faster than me in micro computer applications last year. I wasn’t a very fast typer. I am stupid because I forgot to look to see what time I started writing. I am going to assume that I've only been writing for about three to five minutes. At least I am getting this done though. I have to go to psychology class in forty five minutes. Last class we took these tedious surveys for eligibility  in experiments. It wasn’t fair because there were like 0-0 surveys for just girls. So all the guys got finished and left to go take naps or eat. Speaking of eating, we ordered Poky Sticks from LOCNAME's pizza last night. I hope the roommates pay me back for that. But I don’t want to be rude and ask for the money. I am really cheap. But it is all coming out of my spending money. My friends are all getting money from their parents. My dad is being annoying though. He wants me to learn to budget my own money. He would have given me so much a month if my older sister hadn’t told him that she didn’t get any money her first year in college. Those older siblings cant just be happy for the younger ones can they. Everything has to be fair, doesn’t it. Oh well. I shouldn’t be complaining I guess. I am getting to go to the school I wanted to go to. I am getting the feeling that people around me are trying to read what I am writing. I know they're not though. They have better things to do I'm sure. I’m just paranoid I guess. Today is Thursday. We have a floor meeting tonight. A chance to meet our neighbors. Warning !!! When you log out all your files will be erased!! That is what the sticker on this computer says. I think they are over-using  exclamation marks there. But that is just my opinion. I am not really one to use exclamation marks very freely. I think it is raining. I had to walk back from the library yesterday in the pouring rain with my roommate. She is pretty cool. She smokes too much though. I am trying to break her of that horrible habit. I think she is just getting annoyed with me though. She has bad posture. We've bonded already. I m glad I didn’t get some kinda weirdo for a roommate. She says she is getting a haircut today. Then again she has been saying that for the past two days. I really need to spit this gum out. I've been chewing it for almost two hours. Some random guy gave it to me when I was waiting to go to my boring English class. I need a computer in my room. My mom says she bought me a lava lamp for my room. I really want her to come down and drop it off, but I don’t want her to stay for the weekend. I am getting very sleepy. This staying up until 0am every night cant keep up for much longer. I have about five more minutes to write. What else should I write about. I feel like a lab rat. Are people going to read this later on and analyze me. Will they get in contact with me if they find out that I have some kind of mental illness? Or will they just forget about it and write a book about Me? My shoes are stiff from the rain yesterday. and I have to go to the bathroom really bad. Gotta spit this gum out. I am getting antsy. I think its been twenty minutes. This was fun. 
__label__label1 I do not know what to write about for twenty minutes. It took me so long to get a computer at this place, and I would like to E-mail my best friend in LOCNAME since I never get to see her. Well, I guess this is the coolest assignment that I have had so far since it doesn't require any thinking- well, it actually does. in fact, that's all this assignment is about. But, I mean it is not hard. I am really worried about my classes this semester. I feel like I have been going to school here for a while, but it has only been a week. I have a lot of reading to do. I think my classes are not too hard, but I KNOW THAT THEY WILL GET HARDER, I JUST HOPE THAT I DO WELL. Oops, I just turned the caps lock key, sorry!  Well, I am now thinking about what I should eat for dinner. I am also thinking that I don't want to gain the freshman-00. I eat pretty healthy food in the cafeteria, but I eat a lot more than I did at home. but I guess since all of my classes are miles away from each other, I will be OK. My boyfriend is coming to see me sometime soon, I wish that he was here right now. I hope that he is doing OK because I wonder about him. He's always changing his mind about our whole relationship- whether he thinks it will work out or not. One minute, he is all for it, and another, he thinks it will never work because we are too far away from each other. Anyway, all I know is that I really care about him, and that I have to leave the rest up to God to figure out. I feel really exhausted right now because I only got 0 hours of sleep last night, and then I woke up and went to class after a cup of coffee, something I think I'll have to get used to drinking now that I am here. that's one thing I really miss about College Station, though (even though there can't possibly be that much to miss in a town like that except for the people)  I miss the Java shakes I used to get at Sweet PROPNAME's, this coffee house I love so much. I thought that by coming to LOCNAME, I would surely find a replacement for the Java shake, with all of the many coffee houses here, but I have yet to find something to beat it. Although I did find this shake called a "Skinny Banana Espresso Shake" at a coffee house on the drag called LOCNAME. My really good friend PROPNAME and I go there every Friday now to get one- it's like one of our new little Austin rituals, so we can make sure to stay close by seeing each other once in a while, and making an outing of it. It's really weird though how people you least expect to get so close to, you end up not being able to live without seeing!  PROPNAME and I haven't ever been this close, but lately, we have so much in common. I just hope this isn't one of those "since you're from my hometown, let's be best friends until I meet some other people" kind of thing. Ok I have about six minutes left,  this is actually pretty cool, getting to know how my mind works and all. I already realize how many different topics my mind changes to in just 00 short minutes. I wish my mind did not wander off so many times, because that's really not good for my grades. Like sometimes in class, I will sit there thinking of my boyfriend instead of listening. But, then I go back to paying attention until I start wondering how my dog is doing all alone at home. Well, actually, I haven't thought about my dog during a class yet, but it could happen. Besides, I wanted to bring her up in some way in this little writing experiment, and that was the best way that I could think of. Anyway, as I was saying, I really hope that my dog does not die early since it is do lonely right now. My mom says she just sits on the staircase waiting for somebody to come home- that would be me or my brother. Ok, now I am thinking about me brother, who is the sweetest guy on earth. I hope that he is doing Ok right now. I thought that now that we live in the same city and all, we would actually get to see each other more, but we are so busy, I really don't get to see him until the weekends. Anyway, I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here to help me out. For example, I wouldn't have even known about this big computer lab. well, I am sure that I would have found out somehow, but I didn't have to find out myself. I mean, I don't want to be all dependent on him or anything, but I learn a lot from him, and I learn a lot on my own, too. Well, I think that my twenty minutes are up now. So maybe I will submit this and E-mail my friend PROPNAME. Or, maybe I won't. 
__label__label0 I am so down in the dumps right now because I have just broken off  a two year relationship. I seriously  hope I didn't just throw away the best relationship I ever had or will have. I can't help but feel slightly unattractive right now because PROPNAME has already started to get over me quite well and PROPNAME and PROPNAME don't treat me the way they used to. I don’t understand why people can't simply be honest about the way they feel. I probably have spent half of my life wondering what everyone else was thinking. I t is such a waste of time. If I saw a girl and she seemed really nice, I don't see why I couldn’t just go up to her and be like, "hi"  And  guys won't ever meet a girl with the intention of gaining a friend. The whole process is so much more exasperating than it seems worth at times. The friends I have now are my good friends. I just instantly clicked with them. There wasn't any of this trying not to seem overly eager to hang out with you bullshit that usually goes along with the turf of making new  friends. That's sort of why I resent LOCNAME I guess. The stupid system and expectations they have totally just messed me up in the head. I don't have nay self-confidence. It is hard to feel like you are somebody in a class of 0000. I wasn't good at any sports, or at least not good enough to play there. so why did I come to a school with 00000 people full of clicks just like it was in high school?  I will probably be perpetually putting on the front of self-confidence and self-assuredness. that’s what sucks about the world. Everybody just bullshits everyone else. People are so insincere and self-serving. I know I am. there are so many rules that govern the group that you belong to. You can't wear what you want or anything. I am not saying that I don't like the way that I look but every now and then it would be cool to go out in what I want to wear  or whatever and I could know that people weren't  talking about  it behind my back. Looking at my thoughts on screen makes me so ashamed of them. I'm nit a bad person. I just kive up to every part of the whole Greek system that ever gave it a bad name. rush is such a load of crap. everyone acts like they know or care who you are. it all turns out to be the same people in the same crowds that they ran around with in high school. I wish the rest of the work wasn't like this too. But I guess is doesn’t matter where you go because it will always be the same old bullshit. pretty girls date the cutest boys who have the good luck to bring home the big bucks to raise their kids in an upper middle class lifestyle. so it goes. Kurt vonnegut really knew what was up. That's why I like him because he doesn't preach all this "the sun will come up tomorrow crap"  he knows that if the sun comes up tomorrow you will probably get a really bad sunburn and die of skin cancer in the end. I hope mark doesn’t meet any girls at this party I just don't want it to be too late to have him back once I get this whole lifestyle change thing out of my system. 
__label__label0 0  Freestyle- trying to write down thoughts that are moving so slowly now-- after spending LOCNAME day walking up and down the Drag so many times (seems like millions!) in the hot sun. then waiting in line for this computer for ages. I wonder if this is right because its only making one long line instead of lots of lines Maybe I was supposed to press RETURN! Cant think right now except about going home to my new apartment, which is the first apartment that I've ever had. Very big, clean, airy, light, very TEXAS. I wish I had an apartment that was more original, as if there were only one like it in the whole world. With hardwood floors  and pets allowed. So I could get a PROPNAME PROPNAME. But I’m going to sneak a ferret into my place because they are the CUTEST!!! You can bend them in half and twist them around everywhere and they are so playful. Anyway if I had a ferret I would name it PROPNAME cuz we used to have a kitten named PROPNAME but we had to give it  away. If I had two children I always thought I would name them PROPNAME and PROPNAME, but now I’m not sure because PROPNAME sounds like a name for a psychopath--- like in the Shining. These are the ultimate boring thoughts but my brain is in slow motion so oh well. I’m absolutely starving right now I could eat yum pasta and artichokes and sushi and olives and steak (not all together!) I have weird taste in food because of growing up overseas I can remember being so little and my parents would take us out for Asian food-- me and PROPNAME only four and five and eating spicy kimchi (MMMM) or fighting over what was the best piece of sushi. And when we only babies our favorite treat was FISH EYES, which I wouldn’t be able to stomach now. That was in the LOCNAME, where we left when I was two, and my only memory of it is a grayish image of lizards on the window above my crib. Some memories are suspicious- like I wonder if they are really mine-- maybe at a young age (like 0 or 0), somebody told me how I loved the lizards outside my window and my mind just fashioned a blurry picture of the view from my crib. Its hard to believe that a person can remember things that happened such a long time ago, especially when you cant remember what you had for lunch the day before yesterday or the name of your high school Physical Science teacher (Mr. PROPNAME??) My minutes are nearly up, thank God cuz I need FOOD! Which will probably be Capn Crunch or a tuna sandwich since we need to go grocery shopping. Interesting exercise, too bad my thoughts are nowhere near as beautiful as the stream of con. in LOCNAME. Right now food is the main thing on my mind, thank you for reading this. 
__label__label1 I woke up this morning and I'm thinking. "Where am I?"  And then I realize that I'm at ORGNAME. I was so upset last night because I left after class got out at  0:00. Then everything went wrong. The trolley cart fell off the steps and all of my stuff went crashing to the ground. I got in my car and the needle was  practically buried to the red empty sign so I stop to get gas, then I decide that I had better eat something because as soon as I get there everyone will be ready to go out and I will be starving as usual and afterward no one will want to stop and get poor little old me anything to eat. And boy was I right. PROPNAME says it will only take and hour to an hour and a half to get here. Yeah right. Try two and a half. Someone goes off and gives me the wrong directions that takes me all the way to LOCNAME!  I was so mad at myself because I finally make it here, but I don't have directions to PROPNAME's or PROPNAME's or their phone numbers. I found PROPNAME's and ORGNAME answered which was exactly what I didn't  want to happen. She bothers me. We used to be friends, but then I don't know what happened, it's like all of a sudden, the only thing that she  cared about was who she was around and how much she could be seen doing thins with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But now that she's up here all by herself she sure decided that ORGNAME and PROPNAME and I were perfect people to be her friends AGAIN. I just don't know I mean that I don't like that I feel that way as far as the fact that she just gets on my nerves, but I don't like being mean. I will tell her how I feel, now, because she doesn't seem to have a problem being rude and snotty to me. I went to Audrey's and I wish I had a house like PROPNAME or an apartment like Audrey ORGNAME Ginger. It's nice and filled with a lot more space than my dorm, but then again I kind of like The Woo. LOCNAME and Raya are so  nice. They take care to notice if I'm upset about something and they talk to  me about it. It just doesn't make me feel any better to know that their mothers don't call them EVERY NIGHT AFTER NINE O'CLOCK JUST BECAUSE THEY JUST HAPPENED TO  GET ONE THOUSAND FREE MINUTES ON THEIR PORTABLE PHONE. It's not that I don't like my mother calling, but she calls all the time and tells me to go to bed of all things. Little did she know that I have stayed up until 0:oo every night since Monday, and last night we got home at 0:00 but didn't go to bed  until 0:00. I don't know what she is thinking because she actually could not believe that people stay up until all hours of the night studying. I had to  let her in on a little secret. All of those nights she thought I was asleep, I wasn't. 
__label__label0 I will now try to track my cluttered and random thoughts. as they occur. I am thinking of the love of my life; my girlfriend. We have been together for quite a while and I am truly excited to be a part of her life. I wonder how much longer we will stay together, because I am hoping that my neurotic and almost unbearable tantrums won't strip us apart from each other. Anyway, I try desperately not to think of such negative possibilities, yet they plague my mind sometimes. I have just taken a glimpse of my surroundings. I have a gorgeous view to my right. two large windows forming a 00 degree angle provide a soothing sight. Everything seems tranquil outside, since I am not part of it right now. Everyone looks pleasant and kind, although once I leave this room I know very well that those same serene faces I saw from my fourth story view are far from angelic creatures waiting to befriend someone like me. I like having the security of this window quite a lot. It isn't as if I seclude myself from the rest  of the world at all times, or even want to for that matter, but when life is overwhelming in its abusive tendencies, a break from the constant interactions of it can be appreciated. I am more of a solitary person in these respects. I like to be alone. I like to have the opportunity to just think and think until my mind swells with confusion, questions and lack of answers. I can only speculate why things are the way they are, but this is what I am good at. I like to think without anyone pestering me with questions or remarks of disapproval. I play along with the narrow-minded each and every day and the jeers and taunting that accompanies such individuals. My privacy keeps me sane and feeds my need to vent any emotional clogging. These people who seem so distant from people like me are the same people I am left to befriend, because unfortunately, like any other human being of this world, I need friendship, companionship. It is a necessity. I hate to admit it, simply because I want to view myself as some sort of rebel or ultra independent, yet I know this to not be true. Yet, time after time I find that it is terribly difficult to maintain friends because I am left with people in college(the most convenient to meet) and I have had so little in common with such people. The cycle repeats and repeats. I am late for a class now because I wrote this damn thing, but this is my fault for not watching the time more closely. When I start to ramble about my life I REALLY RAMBLE about my life. Advantage or disadvantage????  I don't know yet. At least I can listen to others. good reason to be a psychology major, right?   
__label__label0 As I sit here trying to think of something to say, my mind is completely blank. This kind of thing always happens when I am trying to write. I guess the only thing on my mind right now is whether or not I am going to make it at such a big school like ORGNAME. I have to walk a lot and the studying is sometimes hard. I am a music major a the time, but I really hate it. I think it is a worthless major. It's too much work for nothing. Music majors don't make ANY money. I think that a big part of going to college is learning how to make money. I guess if I was really devoted to playing the piano money really wouldn't matter to me, but I couldn't see myself sitting on my ass playing the piano the rest of my life. I really want to do something exciting. Another thing that is bothering me right now is the fact that I go to school 00 hours a week and I am only getting credit for 00. That's four hours I am not getting credit for. All of which are of course music classes. I only get 0 hours for a 0 hour Musicianship class and I only get 0 hour for a 0 hour ensemble class. I really like it here, but I miss my friends back home. I think it is going to be weird seeing them again during thanksgiving and Christmas. I want to know how their schools are and if they have been to any good parities or if they have made many friends. One thing about going to ORGNAME is that it is hard to make friends here because there are so many people. I  have, though, made friends with many people that I live with along with some people in my classes. I went to a pretty cool concert this weekend. I went with some of my friends that are still in high school. I miss hanging out with them. It was like old times again. I went with my old boyfriend and all of his friends. I was the only girl as always but that's what I'm used to. I guess I have to keep my attention on what I am doing here though. So that I can survive through college. I think my mom is going to be mad because I may have maxed out my phone card, but that is kinda off the subject. My mind wanders like that sometimes. Tamesha is beating up her CD player. She is sitting next to my cursing at her portable CD player. Now she is blowing the dust out of it because she thinks that it might work better if she does that. well my time is up, and just in time too because my mind just went blank again. 
__label__label1 I want to start with a simple color. Let's say blue. When I think of blue I think of the ocean and where I live. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. It's "on the border by the sea"  That's like the LOCNAME saying. I also think of baby blankets, actually my baby blanket. This leads me to thinking about a LOCNAME LOCNAME song entitled "Baby Blue". It's a song about his daughter that passed away in a car accident. He's describing her eyes and what he thinks about every day. That has to be hard to deal with. A death in the family is such a detrimental thing to cope with. Fortunately my family has never had an immediate family member pass away. The closest I've been to a loved one that has died, was my great-grandmother. I've also had my girlfriend lose her great-grandmother and her grandmother right after each other. I went to those funerals. I really don't like them very much, It's extremely sad for all the loved ones mourning the death. I guess this leads me to thinking about the color black. It's weird that people usually associate things or ideas to color. I guess it's because we're such a vivid creature. Our vision capabilities are quite advanced when compared to those of other animals. We, humans, are able to see most of the spectrum, all we cant see is the ultra-violet end and the, oh I forgot, I think it's the infer red side as well. We might excel in vision, but are still very primitive in the sense of smell. When we compare our smelling to that of canines, all I can say is that they are able to smell around 000-0000 times better than us. Back to black. Jet Black is favorite color, or at least it used to be. I really enjoy viewing the colors of nature. I have found myself buying shirts the colors of nature. Like a dirt/green or pale/orange, light/yellow or sky/blue, the color of soil. I love the smell of the earth after it rains, it smells so pure, rich, I guess I associate that smell to nature. Imagine what a dog smells after it rains. Now that's something I wish I could take a whiff of. That's around 00 min. of writing. I want to say that this has been a great experience for me. It calmed me down from this hurried morning. I feel more at ease with myself, but I can't explain why. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this little talk with me. I know I'm not supposed to use "you" when writing a paper, but the instructions say that it's alright to fib a little in my grammar. Sorry for any misunderstandings. "Good-bye and Good-luck. " 
__label__label1 I'm feeling jealous right now. I got an email from one of my friends. She informed me that my x-girlfriend is now dating a new person. It makes me mad. I don't know why. I don't like her anymore. Oh, well, just forget it. I'm hot. maybe it has something to do with the recent news. I guess I just need to "cool off". I really like it here at LOCNAME. everybody is very nice. I’m trying to think of what to type. I’ve got this particular song in my head, and I can't get rid of it. it's aggravating. I’m tired. I wish I could take a nap, but the dorms are to loud. wow, she's pretty. I wonder if she'll be my future wife. maybe, maybe not. I wonder if I should ask PROPNAME to dinner tonight. I can't think of a way to ask her without making it sound like a date. I fear being rejected. I guess that's what pisses me off about my x. she "just friended" me, but I think the real reason was never mentioned. I hope she rots in hell. Emily’s really nice. she seems really mature. I almost consider her a big sister, but not really. she just acts like she could be. I’m getting sick of jester food. it all tastes the same. like shit. she's attractive. every girl here is really pretty, with some exceptions of course. so far, it seems like college has been all play and no work, except for this of course. there's so many people here. sometimes it's overwhelming. so much diversity. and yet, so much organization. I really like the atmosphere. the game last night was a blast. I’ve never had so much fun at a game. so much spirit and energy running through the air. being in the band is the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. it's taught me a lot. I think I’ve grown up so to speak. the idea of a computer lab strikes me as funny. all these people here, right next to each other, but there's still a sense of privacy. no one ever seems to look at other people's work. so much organization in so much chaos. I like Macs better than PC’s. I don't know why. they just appeal to me more. I wish I had a girlfriend. it's been a long time since I’ve been with someone. I miss it. I like the fact that my parents live here. we don't always get along, but I think that if they lived in another state, or even another city, I wouldn't be doing half as well here. I like the security. it's nice not having to miss them. and to not be homesick. I wish I could stay here forever. I don't want to have to get a job. but, at the same time, I often feel bad that my parents have to pay for my education. I’ve always been that way. I really love my family, I just don't know how to show it very well. I’m ready to start doing more work in classes. they're starting to get boring. I wonder what's to become of PROPNAME. I’ve always liked her, ever since high school. she lives so far away, LOCNAME. I’d love to date her. maybe because while I was with her, I never got the chance. damn, I wish I had the opportunity now. girls are so pretty. why?  sometimes, they get in the way of more important things. sometimes I like the distraction, but sometimes it hurts me. I think I’m going to do well here. no problem. I’m very good at adaptation. I think my time's about up. 
__label__label1 Okay, I just started writing or well I guess typing. I am still kind of emotionless because I just woke up. You know how when you first wake up and you just need to go to the bathroom but after that you don't know what to do. I'm not hungry or thirsty or anything. I am kind of cold though, because the fan is right over my head. I have a pretty good feeling because I got to this page alot easier than I thought I would. Right now the only thing I really think about is a situation I am in. I am dating this guy and he's really great, but he keeps asking where our relationship is going and I don't really know. The big problem is that this guy I dated off and on for over a year is about to be transferred (he's in the ORGNAME) to PROPNAME which is pretty close to here and he calls and writes but never asks if I am seeing anyone new. I don't know if this is because he doesn't care and just wants to be friends or if he just assumes that I am waiting for him. Knowing him he will probably expect me to drop anyone I happen to be involved with as soon as he moves down here. This is something I normally would not mind doing, but I really like this guy I am dating so I don't know what to do. My bathroom is making the weirdest noise right now. I probably need to have that checked out. I am having to shift positions right now because I am not very comfortable and my neck is starting to hurt. Now my nose itches so I have to rub it. My room is a huge mess because they just set up my computer and won't let me throw away any of the boxes so they are piled up in my room until I have the chance to take them home. My hands are starting to shake a little so I must be getting hungry. My roommate should be getting back from class pretty soon and maybe she will make me something to eat. I kind of don't like it when she is in the kitchen though because she tends to make a pretty large mess and it tends to take her a few days to clean it up. You can't really say anything to her because she gets real defensive and it starts a fight. I really miss my cat, PROPNAME PROPNAME, I have had her since I was two and she is BEAUTIFUL!!!  I think my twenty minutes are about up and I am really hungry, so I'm going to end this. BYE!!   
__label__label0   I like the idea of doing class assignments over the WWW. it's much easier. I think someday all assignments and teaching will be done through a web of interlinked computers. Students will sit at home in the same spot every day and fulfill their college requirements without ever seeing a professor or fellow student. I wouldn't like that however. Something would be lost without the direct personal lectures. A person telling me something with a unique style and delivery leaves a greater impression on me than any computer text ever could. I feel like I'm sticking with this subject too long, I'm thinking with too much structure. But I think that is the way I am. Before I communicate, whether by typing on a computer or talking to someone, I usually have a solid idea of what I'm going to say. I don't usually have spontaneous outbursts or a direct communication of a free flowing consciousness. I hear someone whistling in the hall, he's probably an active who will make me clean some mess up. oh well. Wow I reached the second line, I just figured this entire submission would be one never ending line of text; like some huge sentence that rambles on and on and says nothing. Isn't that ironic. I have something in the back of my head that says all this writing is just meaningless rambling. But if this is an exercise to allow my free flowing mind to be translated onto paper, that would mean that what I'm thinking is just meaningless rambling. It's always like that. My mind just jumps from random thought to random sensation (this chair isn't too comfortable) at light speed. No matter how fast I write, I don't think I could ever capture the zany, random, chaotic, and highly elusive thoughts that tickle my neurons for a millisecond then become forgotten in the same instant. But if they become forgotten how do I know about them?  I wonder what I'll do tonight. I'm not sure at all. It's one of those times when I could have fun doing anything. I might. I don't know. it doesn't even matter. I don't know what else to write. I'm at a loss. Maybe by brain just hopped down a frequency. I just went from the imaginative (sort of) colorful thought chord (you know the kind you get when you read a good sci-fi book), to a superficial lethargic tone. I feel like a cave man, the only thing my mind says right now is "food. "  Thank you. 
__label__label0 After spending almost an hour trying to get my computer at home to work on-line, I finally got here. So what do I say?  Well, I guess everybody says that the first time that they do this assignment. I guess all that is going through my head right now is the advancement of the classroom. I am actually fulfilling an assignment by typing on the internet. I think it is pretty cool, though I am a little worried about what the future has to offer. The future is probably a real uncertain thing for me. I do not know where I will be in ten years or even ten months from now. Will college work out for me?  Will I change my major from Advertising to Design and back again or will I totally steer from the graphic arts which I so dearly love and take up a new love or hidden talent. Well, I do not know. I guess that it is all the future really is to me, just a bunch of questions with unclear and vague answers. It is probably the same way for everyone else, at least I hope. What else do I want to type on my new fancy ORGNAME laptop?  I don't know? As I ponder this a song I heard today keeps coming out and no matter what I do I cannot get it out of my head. And as the case always is I can only remember a few lines, while I try to hum the rest. "Blue skies -- all of them gone -- nothing but blue skies from now on" and that is all I can remember. When I come to think of it I really never heard this song today or anything, it just popped into my head. It is from With Honors, my most favorite movie of all time. I don't no whether it is the actors I like, the music, or the emphasis on PROPNAME PROPNAME, one of my favorite poets, along with everybody else. Everytime I take a pause the song starts coming into my head again. When I really listen to the words of the song it is talking about your future, pretty coincidental, I might add. It is almost scary!  But that is what I am going to have in my future, nothing but "blue skies". I think that that is too optimistic for my blood. I am usually the glass-is-half-empty-kind-of-guy. And I do not know -- DARNIT I HIT THAT CAPS LOCK BUTTON FOR THE MILLIONTH TIEM AGAIN. I hat that when I am typing really fast and the ideas are flowing and then -WAM- you hit the caps lock button or some other button  that makes you take time and fix what is in caps or something else. To totally get off the subject or anything, but it is a really beautiful day out, today. If it wasn't so hot outside I probably would be outside right now, instead of in here typing this - whatever it is?  Speaking of being hot. It just me or does it just keep getting hotter as you walk all the way across campus for a class. Well I guess it is better than rain. I always want the grass on the other side of the fence -- my mother says to me all the time. I informed her the other day that I was going to have a better life when I become rich and famous. As I soon found out that I shouldn't have brought up this subject to my mother, because she spouted for the millionth time that the "Grass is not always greener on the other side. "  I totally do not agree with that. I just told her that I want things to be better and that you always need to strive for the best and I think that there is nothing wrong with that. My hands are starting to hurt!  I think I am going to stop. I feel sorry for the person who has to sit down and read this. Well I bid you farewell. And may all your skies be blue! 
__label__label0 OK. I don't know much about this computer stuff. I was lucky  to even get on to this homepage. Well I just got disconnected and I think my tension level just went up a few notches. I am felling really sick  already and I went this day to end. I was planning to go work out tonight but it is too late. I still have math and history work left to do. I  really hate math, I can't understand anything that is being said. It really makes me feel like an idiot. I look at my friends here and they all understand everything that is being said . I wish my math class in high school had taught me more. I guess tomorrow I will get up to go run. Ok. I just hit another wrong button , now I really feel worthless. I am going to have so much trouble this semester, when am I going to get to the classes that I really want. It is looking like I'm going to graduate college in another twenty years. As long as I do my best then I guess everything will work out. I miss my family and my friends back in LOCNAME. I wish that I could go back sometimes. If there was anything to go back to. I don't think that they really care that I am so far away. It is like I think to myself that things might be so much better there. Like if I  went back then my life would all make since. I think that I would be confused anywhere I go. Well my typing is starting to slow down now. My hands are getting tired. God, I should have taking a typing class in High school. My sweet mate is  watching late night and it is starting to get on my nerves. It is so loud. please let my twenty minutes be up. I need to get my act together if I don't then I will just be wasting my parents money. Maybe I should give my parents a call. But I think that I will wait for them to call me. I need to prepare for school. I need to try to socialize more. If I could manage more time. Maybe I should be an actor and work as a waiter in LOCNAME LOCNAME in the mean time. But there I go again with my fantasies. I'm probably stuck with a boring life like most people. Well my twenty minutes is up, I hope that my slow typing  has ruined this survey.  
__label__label1 Ok so here I am at my computer lab and I am supposed to be typing about what is going on in my head. well nothing really, just waiting for the weekend to come and  what I am going to do . I have no idea on what I am going to do maybe I’ll go  out with my roommate or my friends PROPNAME and tiffany, I don't know. I wish I could see PROPNAME, I miss him so much, but he is coming down the weekend of his  birthday so I’ll just wait. am I falling in love, oh well too late, I am already in love but I can't be cause I’m here and he is there and I just can't do this to myself. but am I going to find somebody here. I don't want to throw myself on guys but I don't want to be just some face in the crowd. how can you meet people if  you just don’t want to talk??  I don’t know I don’t care I do love PROPNAME and I wish he would get his act together so my mom and dad will like him a lot more and we can have a serious relationship. It's been three years now and I can't stop  going back to him, do I just want the feeling of knowing that I have somebody or  what?  I have been a lot happier since we started talking. I don't know, I'm so  confused. I don't want to turn out like my sisters that married someone that is somewhat worthless and have no money for half of my life. I am better than that. I don’t know. am I saying that too much. I am so glad that you are not reading  this because you would think I was a complete psycho. I hate English class, I ] hate to write. It sucks sooooo much. My hands are starting to hurt. I don't  practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball.

__label__label1 In the eighteen years of my life I've realized that man is either born without a conscience or with one. I was born with one. In my heart I bleed at the injustices of the world, of the rights taken from humans because they had not the power. What is more distressing comes not from the fact that the injustice is so evident but because of the powerlessness of the victim. I believe that education can free a man. An educated society becomes more aware. It can offer self-esteem, knowledge, influence, and the voice to speak out. It has become my belief that I or anyone else who is willing can make a difference. The conscience in me longs to make a difference. To scream at the top of my lungs, "This is wrong! You are wrong! Give back his rights! Give back what does not belong to you!" but I know in the bottom of my heart that humans, no matter how hard they may try will never rid the earth of its total harshness, because some men were born with feeling and some without. This gives no excuse for not trying to make a change for the better because with every change, an initiation must begin. Though my eyes see the sorrow of the world, I am a person who strives to look for the positive in people. My first encounter with an individual has me searching and finding his good qualities. More likely I am opt to say something good about a person rather than bad. Within me I feel no intimidation toward others strengths and I take pleasure in finding and praising someone else's gifts. Determination is the driving force of my soul. Being perceptive of other's nature has allowed me to see that it takes more than intelligence to reach a goal. I know only if I want it can be done and within my veins is a spirit that keeps me aiming to reach the top. It seems forever that I have expected highly of myself. With every aspect of my life I feel a certain pull to be the best I can be. Rarely do I accept being less. My love of knowledge and natural curiosity arrives from my need to grasp my world to better understand it. I cannot accept just reading new knowledge. It is utterly important for me to comprehend it as well. This allows me to know the unknown, to conquer all the earth's secrets for I do not like being put in the dark. I must see all things with my eyes, my heart, and my brain. This gives me confidence and strength. Hopefully, I will conquer all my fears, build my character, and use it to make a difference in the world. 
__label__label0 I wanted to write about something traumatic that happened to me because, apparently, traumatic experiences and how to deal with ORGNAMEm is a pretty big fandango in this class. Something just happened, though, so I want to write about that and see where it takes me in the next nineteen minutes or so. The computer assistant in the theatre department (where I am right now, being a theatre major and all) just complimented me on my hat, a black fedora I bought in LOCNAME LOCNAME about a year and a half ago. I was visiting for about a week over spring break and auditioning for the elusive Experimental Theatre wing ORGNAME ORGNAME's ORGNAME ORGNAME of the ORGNAME. After a fairly successful audition I concentrated all of my efforts of exploring, something I had done about seven or eight months earlier the first time I visited. This time I was alone, though. The time before I had my brother, eighteen months my junior and my closest friend, at my side and all was well. This time I had to w0ait a couple of days for his arrival, since he couldn't get off school and I could, being a senior and having a few excused absence "college days" on my hands. So I set out to explore and found a bar in the mob district of LOCNAME LOCNAME that didn't ID and I found myself drunkenly wandering the streets of LOCNAME LOCNAME, stumbling upon Strawberry Fields in a haze and not realizing the significance until about a week later. After three days of being lost in my drugged little haze my brother joined me. When I picked him up at the airport I noticed that I had taken to thinking of myself as a LOCNAME LOCNAMEer. I had adopted the city and there was a definite change in the way my brother and I related to each other. This changed over the next four days, though, as he assimilated into New York the way I had and we set out to LOCNAME LOCNAME to begin our evenings with a little pasta, a Nat King Cole impersonator, a jug of white wine every night, and a restaurant owned by the mob.  After taking in as much of the culture and the underbelly of the city we found ourselves down to our last (having just dropped twenty bucks on some Thai food that smelled like sewer filth). It was our second to last day in the city and we decided to thrift store shop and try to extend our dollars as far as they would go. Then we saw them. In a small shop in the Village (not that there aren't a billion of them) we both saw fedoras that just said "you". We ended up dropping our last fifty dollars on our new hats and had to pay for our ride to the airport ( a limo, surprisingly cheaper than a taxi because it had a set fare) with a handful of quarters. We hadn't eaten for two days and there wasn't a meal of any kind on the plane (not even peanuts) so we wound up in LOCNAME on a two hour layover with nothing to do, empty stomachs, and no money. I ended up begging, trying to sell a stack of demo tapes I had cut for two bucks a pop. I ended up selling two, and we ate the best ORGNAME ORGNAME that has ever been eaten by a human. I remember that the only people who bought the tapes were other musicians. Maybe it's a karma thing ("Wow, that guy looks pathetic. Better buy his tape because that could be me someday. ")  One way or the other they understood. I was upset just because my plan was to randomly hand out this stack of tapes to people as they departed for different corners of the country, hoping that they would like it and that underground distribution would abound. Maybe it worked: I still don't know. I know it was passed around quite a bit in south LOCNAME, but not much further than that. Oh, well. By the by, I'm really tired right now because my band played a two hour show last night. We haven't played that long in about a year, since clubs usually limit you to an hour or less. We used to go two hours without even trying when we were playing for our friend's parties, but now we've gotten lazy. Last night really woke us up. I was so drenched in sweat that I actually had to wring out my shirt after the show. We didn't even get a decent crowd until the last thirty minutes or so. That's ok. Better things will come along soon enough. We play every Thursday at ORGNAME ORGNAME, which has no cover and is all ages. For some reason, this alone does not attract a crowd. It's really upsetting. I know we're not a bad band, so it's really frustrating when you can't talk people out of disco dancing at PROPNAME PROPNAME to enjoy a free show that accepts all ages and doesn't involve a DJ. Someday. About that traumatic experience. About five months ago I was hit by a car while I was crossing the street into PROPNAME's off LOCNAME. It was late and I was wearing all black and the guy didn't see me. I was looking the other way because I saw the car that hit me but he seemed too far away to reach me. I was more concerned about cars coming from the other direction, which is a curving road that is hard to see down. When he hit me his fender shattered my leg and I was thrown onto his windshield. He didn't brake until then and the force of him braking as I hit the windshield sent me flying into the road about twenty feet out. I never lost consciousness and never really felt all that dazed or affected by it. I just calmly looked up, announced that my "fucking leg was broken" and asked one of my friends to call 000. Then I just lay down in the road waiting for the ambulance. It started to rain. That night I was taken to LOCNAME and left alone for about an hour at a time in the ER. Only one of my friends cam to visit me. She held my hand while they pieced my leg back together and set it into a cast. They had already pumped me with morphine and I heard them mumble about amputation a time or two, but eventually they settled on inserting a rod from my knee to my ankle. The morphine did nothing to me, though, because they gave it in light doses and after years of recreational drug use I wasn't really affected. That and the pain was coming from the one part of my body where intravenous drugs couldn't possibly go. I ended up just biting down on a folded-up blanket, not wanted my screams to disturb others in the ER. Over the next three days I was observed and recovered quicker than anyone imagined. My family came to be with me from LOCNAME LOCNAME, except for my dad who was in LOCNAME on business. He wanted to rush to LOCNAME to be with me but I didn't want him to see me tied up to machines and weak. I knew he couldn't handle it. After about a half hour of coaxing he stayed in LOCNAME. He hasn't had a drop of alcohol in twenty years after getting a kidney removed before I was born. That night he drank himself into submission. Slowly my friends from the theatre department began creeping in until I had a steady stream of visitors and a room full of flowers, candy, and porn (don't ask). The faculty came to make sure that I was alright, something I never would've expected, and one night my nurse ( a PROPNAME PROPNAME sort of woman) turned my bed so that I could see the tower lit up in orange. I've never had school spirit or pride in any organization whatsoever, but for some reason I cried. For some reason I loved the sight of the tower at that moment. I've recovered completely. I was angry for a while and spent a lot of time screaming and damning anyone who could walk while I made my way around in a wheelchair. I marveled at the fact that, even when I was on crutches, nice families at the Arboretum would still pull their children closer and hold their purses tighter. I began to keep a journal, but by the time I had written five entries my anger was gone. My depression was gone. I couldn't even dwell of death, which I know I had cheated. I was just glad to be alive and to put it all behind me. Now I'm physically and emotionally recovered. I don't have nightmares and I don't fear cars. I don't know why. Maybe I'll learn that this semester. For some reason I recovered very nicely in all aspects from this whole awful little episode.  The good thing is that I'm happy and sober now. I had attempted suicide twice this past year, once just two weeks before the accident. Then I was put in a situation where I didn't try and death actually came for me, and I fought to stay alive. That's always struck me as odd. Oh well. For whatever reason I am a happier, if quieter person. Things are good. I'm looking forward to psychological experiments this year. Now I'm off. I've written for about thirty minutes and I think it's time for a cigarette. Bye bye now.   
__label__label0 Stream of Consciousness  Well here I am. I wonder why the professor asked us to do this? I had to do this once before. I can't remember what class it was for. I think it was for English class. I liked my English teacher. I think her name is Mrs. PROPNAME. She was a good teacher. She sounded when she read to us. I'm glad I took that dual credit English class, now I don't have to take English in college. That is one less thing to worry about. I wonder if I turned off the oven? Oh yeah, I did. I can't believe I left the refrigerator open all night. I'm just glad my milk didn't spoil. I just bought it. At least I don't think it spoiled, it tasted pretty good in my cereal this morning. I need to buy more cereal. That new cereal is pretty good. I think those fish sticks upset my stomach. I think next time I'll buy fish fillets. I like fish and fishing. I wonder if there is any place to fish around here. I think lake PROPNAME is close but I'm not sure. Then again it be far. I don't know what to get my girlfriend for her birthday. I think I'll get her a card, some flowers, and take her out to dinner. I really miss her. I hope she goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME next year so she will be closer and I can see her more often. I can't believe I have to go to ACC next semester to take college Algebra. I must have skipped a question and didn't skip it on the answer sheet. I've already taken calculus in high school and I made an A. I can't believe I scored so low on the SAT 0 math part. I wonder if there is any more Kool-Aid left? I think there is grape, get some when I'm done. I'm real thirsty but he said not to stop once you've started. My hand is cramping. I think this callous on my finger is getting bigger. I hope I can figure out how to get my computer to work on the internet. I guess I'll just ask somebody. I hate to ask people things, especially directions. I think I'm done. 
__label__label1 it has been raining for the past 0 days and I guess that has  a lot to do with everyone's attitudes. I feel a little relieved and tired though I had my first test of the semester this morning. I feel tired because I spent the majority part of the weekend partying rather then studying like I should have. now I was forced to cram study this morning just because of my laziness and inability to control my desires to go out with my friends. I should recover with a good nights sleep tonight. I called my father today. I'm trying to get on his good side now because he has been very disappointed in me. for some reason I seem to keep getting myself in situations that are to his beliefs not appropriate. the bad part about it is that I know that I am doing wrong but I still continue to do other things that make feel that he has failed as a parent. I guess he think is that if I am not perfect then he has failed as a parent. I'm trying to get it to him that I still have a lot of things going for me. I guess as a parent you want what's best for your child. so any little flaw on my part makes him feel that he did not do a good job raising me. I feel totally different though. I believe that I have thee best parents in the world because they have provided me with al the possible things to help me better myself in every way possible. in other matters work is going pretty well I will probably be getting a raise soon. my performance has been really well so maybe it will be a substantial raise            
__label__label1 I'm curious to know whether or not there is or isn't a timer in this program and if it were possible to just quit typing and claim that 00 minutes have passed. My thoughts and emotions concern my future and what I'm going to do. Do I really want to be a psychology major or am I just saying that because it sounds cool. I want to counsel, but id really like to make a ton of money. Maybe everyone is right, I should be a business major, that's what everyone else is doing. But I don't want to deal with  that crap for the rest of my life. I think its boring and stupid. The future is such a difficult concept to ponder. Sometimes I have different goals for it. should I try to satisfy myself, friends or family?  I mean it when I tell my friends that I want to be a professional wrestler, it looks so stinking fun. Just jumping around and bad acting. Well, an acting career would be nice too, but I'm to shy and insecure for that. I think I could do it, but I wouldn't want to associate myself with the thespian weirdoes. I don't think id be able to be my best if I had a problem fitting in with  weirdoes. Maybe I'm the weirdo. nah. probably not. I may be stereotyping them, but, hey, they're weird man. I've seen the way they act. They put the stereotype on themselves. I'm sure there's a couple nice ones though. I wonder if all the famous actors were at one time like that. My mind just drifted to PROPNAME. She sent me a message saying that she had a couple of dates this past weekend. I wonder how true that is. Of course its true, but its weird how she never dated in high school and then all of a sudden at ORGNAME she's a hot item. I still think about that monster crush I had on her my sophomore yr. I wonder if she liked me too. Everyone thought she did. But I never had the balls to find out for myself. I'm going to regret that for the rest of my life. I'm such a fucking pussy. The same thing last yr. If I had the balls, I think I could have got something started with  PROPNAME at ORGNAME. Instead, now, we're just good friends. I could have used some support too. But that fucking PROPNAME would have been too jealous if PROPNAME and I got something started. That prick, I think he could've hooked me up with  PROPNAME too. But he needed her, if not, who would he use to cheat on his girlfriend???  Then her roommate, PROPNAME, man, she's such a little bitch. The thing is, she's not even pretty man. Its okay to be snobby and bitchy if your hot, but she was an ugly little girl, with  nothing to show for herself. Amazing how she was dating all the time. Then her fucking attitude about how she has the perfect mate in mind, but wants to date, because its part of the  college experience. PROPNAME thought like that too. That's such a fucking crock man. As Christians they shouldn't be thinking like that. if this almighty god already picked out the perfect mate for them, there is no reason for them to date around to have fun. They love justifying things. There is something wrong with  what your doing fi you have to justify it man. And then ray went to that LOCNAME trip to witness to a bunch of poverty stricken Mexicans. Its funny how he couldn't convert me to Christianity in 0 months, but he thinks he can do a whole Mexican community within a couple of weeks. I guess its easier when you feed them and shit. talk about taking advantage of people. Why don't these gung-ho Christians go witness to the people who really "need Jesus"  They should make mission trips to LOCNAME D. C. and talk to the politicians. they're the fucking sinners man. and the business people too. they're the ones fucking this world up. working for Satan. They don't want to witness to them because they're smarter than them, and they can't find a way to take advantage of them. Christianity is fucked up sometimes. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite for going to ORGNAME, but if I didn't I wouldn't know anyone. They're nice and I enjoy being there. But most people there have less of a commitment to god than I do, so oh well. I'm glad I'm at LOCNAME though. its way better than ORGNAME, god, I used to get so depressed there. but I'm proud of myself, I toughed out that bullshit. I miss a lot of the guys though. It was a different sort of friendship, but it was cool. I still wonder if I would've stayed if my 0st semester was like the 0nd. but then again I was about to go crazy towards the end. PROPNAME and PROPNAME. and big PROPNAME almost killed me!!  I hope I date here. I think that's all I need to be happy. a good woman. I'd like to have what lijay has, or anything really. I think I'm the only one in our click rite now without someone to "talk to". times up. . 
__label__label0 I just always feel like I am better off when I get things done. I have found that I have been procrastinating a lot lately and I just want to get things back into order so I can do more fun things. I was happy about passing by the LOCNAME tennis club booth on my way back from class, I am hoping to have time to do that. I really wish I talked to the UT tennis coach abt playing on the team but ihope the players in this club are competetive and have fun personalities at the same time. not only do I like tennis, but I am happy bec it will give me a workout. I don't have much time to go to the gym  now and I really want to work out more often. I picked up an aerobics schedule today so maybe I will have time for some classes. but all of this reading and studying I have to do takes up more time than expected, I just feel like I don't have enough hours in my day to accomplish all of my goals. tonight I had a sorority meeting to go to which was so boring and I just wanted to leave so I could do more imprt things with my time. but I know in the long run this sorority thing will pay off bec I will get to meet a lot of people and it is an easier way to make friends whenyou already have this sort of group formed and you just have to actually meet the people already selected. ok, that was a really long and complicated sentence. another worry that is on my mind is regarding that experimental thing we have the option of doing. when I went to sign up today, all of the experiments were full so now I am worried I wont get a spot in a study and I will have to do the research paper. not that that is terrible, but iw ould just prefer not writing the paper, especially since I already took my time to fill out the pre testing form last night. whatever. I will have to just get used to everything and all the new changes, since I am a freshman and everything. when that happens, then I will be better able to organize my time and not stress so much. speaking of stress, I should have signed up for that reducing stress freshman seminar, it would have been really helpful abt now. actually, all the seminars were full by the time I got to register, since I was at the last orientation session - terrible mistake. I should have come to an earlier one but I didn't decide to come to school here until it was too late to get into the earlier sessions. so I had to go to the later one, oh well. at least I got classes that are required, I can't get everything I suppose. going to the university of florida was my other option but everyone I know, from  my high school and every other part of florida, goes there and I kind of wanted to get away from everything. even though I do miss pewople a lot, I think I am better of here. and, the good business school was a main consideration. since I was accepted, I felt like it was a good opportunity and I shouldn't give it up. everyone always asks me why I came all the way from LOCNAME, florida to texas and I always say bec of th ebusiness school. and that's true and all but ir eally like other thinga abrt it too. I was just admiring today the fountains - I love the nvironment. except for the people hanging around on guadeloupe that I have to pass by on my way back to the castilian everyday - where I live. those people scare me, and I know I have nothing to be scared of I just don't like seeing them there. anyway, I am looking at a picture of me and my mother now and thinking about how my parents are leaving on a trip to europe tomorrow morning - that will be fun. I hope they have a great trip an safe. I am always worried abt them, I just don't want anything to happen to them. I know my mom is scared of flying and I just hope everything is ok for them. they have wanted to go to france and england for a long time. actuakly, they wanted to got o italy too - they were all jealous that I got ot go there with my friends a couple of spring breaks ago. whenever I think abt that trip I think abt how I wrote abt it - the uffizi museum to be more specific - in my application to the university of virginia. even knowing that you souldnt write abt trips I still did it, I guess I thought they wouldnt care if I did it. that's funny. I guess I am still bitter I didn't get into there, it was my top choice of schools. but I am happy at UT. I hope it doesn't get as cold as it sometimes does. anything below 00 is terrible for me, coming from miami and all where the temperature stays on an average of 00 - I love it. speaking of which, playing tennis all the time int hat heat was not too much fun, but it was loads of fun. I miss my tennis coach, she sent me a present here but I havent gotten it yet, I should call her. but I havent talked to her inso long I think it would be weird to call her, oh well. maybe I will one day, I guess I should to say thank you when the present comes. or I could send  a card, whatever. I will decide later, if it ever gets here!! well, 00  minutes is up and I would like to write more but, like I said before, so much to do and so little time. I still ahve to read a million and two pages and I only have 0 classes tomorrow. I just want to get te next days reading out of the way so idont have to thinka bt craming it all in tomorrow night. this was fun! 
__label__label1 I mean, each day I wonder why I am here on this earth. and then other times, I wonder why I go through some of the stuff I do go through. it seems at times that the "good" people get the worst parts of life, while the "villains" in life seem to get the better things in life. that bugs the hell out of me. then there is love. something that is near and dear to me. I look around and I see great females who choose to stay in relationships with guys who treat them like "scum". it's so ridiculous sometimes. the worst is when these girls as for the nice guy, but when one comes along, they ignore him and guy for the guy that may boost their social status. sometimes I guess the girls out there that are like that deserve the treatment they get. other than, life seems great right now. every piece of the puzzle is here. except one thing. I have no one to wake up for each morning. but other than that, thing seems to be falling into place. I use to be a person that required love and what comes along with it. but after my last relationship, I have learned to take life A LOT easier and just "chill". sometimes I might take it to an extreme and therefore I do get myself in trouble or do things that make me disappointed in myself. I worry that this new "care-free" life may eventually take me over with it's great appeal. but only time will tell if that will happen. most of my close female friends feel that I have changed to a more fun and loose person, but at what because??. some feel I have already changed too much and have become a totally different person. I do see myself as changing, but the core of who I am has not changed and hopefully it will never change. I feel that my beliefs and morals and etc are still the same. I have changed a few beliefs, or I should, I am considering changing a few beliefs I have, but it's nothing to strong. it's more like how I choose to take life and what I think is important. but some of the beliefs that I am considering changing or what has my friends worried. because once again, they feel I may become a totally new person and become a person without the same sympathy that I use to possess. but like everything else in life, only time will tell. but I see my myself as evolving rather than changing. make sense??. it's like I am becoming a stronger person. especially emotionally. I am still as sensitive as I used to be. tears come natural for me. but as far as love and stuff. it's not as blinding as it used to be. it's like I gained "sunglasses" somehow as I evolved. even my poetry has changed with my evolution. my first couple of works were specifically about love and what goes along with it. but my most recent collection focused on death, suicide, and the afterlife. I wasn't at all suicidal or anything. but the artistic side of me wanted to try something different from the usual love stuff. but it seems through everything I do, that I have matured. I am less likely to hold grudges than I used to. I have pretty much become friends with most, but not all of my past "grudges". I guess once you get out of high school, things you once considered important seem ridiculous now. kind of odd huh??. there were people in high school that I would have died for and would have died for me, but now we barely talk. and then there's the people I never talked to much, but now I spend most of my time with. it's weird how one summer can change so much. but I guess this past summer "weeded" out the friends who weren't really friends. the friends you have now are the ones that will stay true to you for awhile. or at least until something catastrophic occurs. I remember in high school, I thought my click would never break up. we were almost like brothers. but now we are like strangers. maybe time will change things back. or maybe it was just meant to be. but as of now, my life seems to be a constant vacation. yea there is classes and stuff, but everything is so laid back. there is no pressure whatsoever. not yet at least. but we'll have to see how all that goes. life is a mystery and I doubt anything will ever make sense. just take whatever opportunity you get, and never postpone anything until tomorrow. cause you never know, there may not be a tomorrow. and one should always keep their mind open to anything. the most sure people in our world have changed their minds. sometimes our past or the facts that are presented to us can alter our opinion on matter. however, it's okay to have a strong belief about something as long as you believe in it with you heart and nothing more. a lot of people today are just followers. they believe what they are told. they don't think for themselves to see if what they are told makes any sense whatsoever. many cases in history have resulted badly. look at World War 0. the entire country of LOCNAME followed the madman named PROPNAME. he was a lunatic, but one has top give him credit for being able to convince a whole nation that he was right. then to convince them to allow him to be dictator. the sad thing is that, that could still happen today. maybe not with the same "material", but if a person said the right thing with the right motivation, any country could fall. even the supposed "untouchable" U. S. A. nothing is untouchable. just like how nothing lasts forever. nothing 
__label__label1 my duty is to get a date tonight for Friday when we have our mixer that is 00's based. I am looking forward to meeting some more girls than I already know. I believe that this stuff is fun whether or not it takes a whole lot of my time. although I have not had enough time to work out as much as I would like. I feel as though I am losing some muscle tone. the food at towers does not help with the dirth of a suitable protein source the food is extremely inedible I have a very hard time consuming enough food to keep my normal body weight up. at dinner I usually eat with either my pledge brothers or my roommates. my roommates are nice guys even if my suite mates are afraid of girls and this hampers our activities. I have a large amount of laundry to do but really do not feel like doing it. I have to acquire red wing boots by tomorrow or my team will lose the game. school is strange because I am never sure if I have done all my work or if I need to study some stuff more it is hard to judge how much you need to study when you have never taken a college test before. I reckon the tests will be fairly challenging although I think my high school prepared me well for these tests. I need to ask a date to the rice football game but I am not sure just who to ask. the football games are cool although my ticket at the first game had my on the highest row possible. I think PROPNAME PROPNAME is good although he is not as good as jamal PROPNAME of LOCNAME. I think LOCNAME will lose by a large margin to ORGNAME then they will get stomped by LOCNAME state. we will finally win at rice but then we will win at the other teams I think although the schedule is a mystery. I can't wait to go home to LOCNAME at thanksgiving to see all my friends. and my freaking car. I wish I could play more basketball and release my athletic energies. 
__label__label1 PROPNAME just walked into our apartment and PROPNAME is asleep. Maybe I need to work on some other stuff. This pre-testing page is down. it keeps shutting down every time I try to use it. I wonder why I even try sometimes. Why am I doing all this stuff enter night. into night  grain of sand. off to never-never land. I just typed PROPNAME lyrics. I don't even like ORGNAME   this is kind of weird. I don't think that I can keep doing this for 00 minutes. PROPNAME's starting to wake up now. at least most of my studies are done because I'm going to play ORGNAME later tonight. Do I play at Trees or not?  I just think that it will be too hard to actually get to LOCNAME in time to do it. I can't relax enough to do stream of consciousness. I'm completely aware of everything I'm typing even though it's not selective. boy PROPNAME is loud. PROPNAME's so cute when she's sleeping. she's starting to wake up. oh wow. I can see her underwear. she'd be a bit embarrassed. she's up know. and gave me a big smile.        now she's laughing at me. now she's trying to talk to me and distract me from my work. going on for twenty minutes?   My word. I don't have time for this. I think I have the Psychology department figured out but I think they just have everybody take these intro psyche classes so they can get info for their own experiments. they just make it look like a class so they have a bunch of subjects. a cigar. I could use one right now. I'm so stressed out. I'm tired of that bare naked Ladies song. PROPNAME is talking to me right now. what a moron he is. . just about random stuff. . yes go on. exchange the genesis for mario kart. that's a good idea. we're getting mario kart. . I guess I'm going for twenty minutes. . it's been a long time. I have no more to write. I'm going now. by0e. 
__label__label0 don't take waste a minute you have to have no worries. spending time with people you love and have fun with is what makes those great memories that you look back on. right now I should be living life to it's fullest ( I should always actually) because things only get more and more complicated. sometimes I feel so confused and it gets me down, but the weird thing is, is that I can't pinpoint what I'm confused about. that's bad for me because then I can't talk to anyone about it--that's what usually helps me get things off my mind. I am going home this weekend to see my brother from l. a. LOCNAME and he is bringing his new girlfriend. I'm anxious to meet her because she sounds so sweet. I wonder if this is the girl he will marry--I always think of that when a relationship begins. I truly believe that a couple should go out at least one year and a half before they think of marriage--it takes a long time to see all of the other's weakness, and characteristics. it is way too hot for me--it drains me so much. I dropped history because I had a really bad feeling about it--the teacher was on a different level than I was and I could not learn from her. I feel a bit weird and guilty for dropping it because I usually stick things out no matter what, but I need to do well this semester so I had to make sure. I really want to go tubing, or hiking or something outdoors every weekend. being outdoors really relieves the stress in me and I am automatically happy. I miss my dog. some people just don't like to get up and do something. they sit there and think about how much energy it is going to take to do something (such as go tubing) and think about how long it is going take to drive there/  rather than just getting up and doing it!  I need to do things that I think of and when I want. no better time than the present. I hate nightmares. they've been sticking in my head lately all day after I wake up. they seem to  be getting stronger and stronger. I dream about sad or fearful things all of the time. exercise is so important for me ( not to lose weight etc)  it seems to keep me happy and feeling good. it's not a chore for me to exercising. what should I write about. I think I want to go sky diving but I seem to be getting more and more fearful of things. more nightmare--fear of animals getting me. I don't want to be a baby about that sort of stuff because I don't want to miss out on anything. I want to do so much outdoors but it makes it hard when I am so scared of animals. I used to be a tomboy and play with worms and bugs etc but it's a different story now. kids also make me happy. they are full of innocence and curiosity. I could sit there and just watch kids all day. I miss soccer and art from when I was in high school. those are things I enjoyed. I decided that I am going to play intramural soccer here. I hope I have fun in it. I want to do tile paintings when I get older. my mother is so sweet, people seem to take advantage of the nicest people in the world. my brother always gets his heart broken because he is so nice. I want to find him the perfect girl because that's what he deserves!  I love and miss my family so much. we have always been so close and everyone can see it. it's a weird close because we don't show our love to  each other all of the time but we are very very protective over each other and interested in helping every one out. there's five kids. big families can be difficult but there are so many good things about it too! 
__label__label1 I am very disappointed. its been raining all day and I'm tired. I didn't sleep last night, that isn't any good. I can't stand not sleeping. Sometimes I think that maybe I'm just not good enough for college, or at least ORGNAME. Things have been hectic the whole time I have been on campus, and if I don't do good this semester, I'm going to fail out. I hope that I can pull this all off. The weekend was nice though, partying with all of my fraternity brothers was a good time, and seeing all of my old high school baseball buddies was cool too. I need to do stuff like that more often. I hope that things can get back to the way they used to be, since I liked everything much much more back then, when my whole life was a hell of a lot simpler. I miss high school, sadly enough. I liked school a lot better when it was just me and 0000 other people. I knew everyone, everyone knew me. Life was good. I can't stand this 00k of people on campus around, it drives me crazy. I'm lucky to see A friend walking around campus, let alone a lot of them. Oh well, I hope that life gets better soon. This weekend should be a lot of fun. Oh, my pizza is ready, its been 00 minutes since I sat down. I spend a lot of time thinking and then trying to transfer things to words. Same old problem for me. I can think great, but when it comes to putting things to words, I suck. 
__label__label0 I mean, there were many questions about over eating. of course everyone wants to lose weight that is a given. and the thing about the spiders is just plan dumb. oh but my friend on the fourth floor asked me to go up and kill a lizard for her. when I went in to the room she was on top of a chair with a flashlight shinning at the lizard. it was hilarious. and it wasn't like the lizard was huge. she was just really really afraid. man, I  have a lot of homework and studying to do. I came here in the summer and I always had reading to do and now it is like I have 0 times the work. it is very cold right now. my room always stays below 00. oh man, I woke up at 00:00am to the sound of someone drilling!! I was very upset. it lasted about an hour and a half. I have a lot of laundry to do. my clothes are all strung out on my floor. I wonder if anyone is going to read this besides the psychology department. I don't think any normal people would want to read this. you know it wasn't until this previous year that I learned how to spell psychology correctly. weird huh? I just never took the time to learn. my sister went and watched saving private ryan. she said that it wasn't any good and that she hated and the killing. and now she will have a test over it on monday. she said it was hard for her to pay attention. for her sake I hope she paid good enough attention that she passes it. I had the same english teacher that she has right now. I won't mention any names but she is a really hard teacher. she started out as a dean of students at sul and then she went to my old high school. she was really hard and expected a lot out of us. I found that I like the challenge. I think that someone just had a wreck. I'm sitting here typing and I heard screeches and then a bang. I heard that this morning, only it was a bigger bang. I didn't get up to look. I was very tired. I hope that everyone is okay. my room is very cold!!! I wonder why they set the thermostat so low. here it is in the summer and I'm sitting in my room with sweet pants and a long sleeve shirt on. I normally have on a sweater. you know, I wonder what everyone else will be typing about. I decided not to worry about capitalizing my words because the instructions stated to not worry about grammar or sentence structure, which is great because I'm not that good with grammar and sentence structure. I wish we didn't have to type for 00 minutes. I have been going for 00 minutes now. I hope that the next seven minutes go by fast. to whoever is reading this, how many have you read? I wonder if there are any interesting. I think that psychology could be interesting. I just don't like some professors. for example, in my exercise physiology class I have this proff that just kills the class. not literally, but it is a very interesting class and I have trouble staying awake. I wonder if I chose the right major. I mean I like physical therapy and all, but I think that I would rather be working with cancer patients. I wonder what people are writing on this thing. I wonder if someone is treating it like their own personal diary. I have four minutes now. after these four minutes are up I'm going swimming. no not really, I have to do homework. I have a big concert to go to tomorrow and I'm trying to finish all my studies. you know I use to never use the word studies but for some reason it just came to my head. I like to write papers like these, no grammar, no structure just typing. I like to type I can type over 00 wpm. I'm currently looking for a job. and so if the person reading this knows of any available positions that I might be good for, you just let me know. I have one more minute left and I plan on finishing at the time I am suppose to. I bet that some people don't type for twenty minutes. I could have typed for 00 minutes for all you know. for some reason at the beginning of this assignment I was thinking about things to type but not any more. obviously. well my time is up. peace out. 
__label__label1 I have tried on three different occasions to do my pretesting for this class and the stupid computer tells me to try again later. why should I try again later. I'm already going out of my way to come down here in the first place. my dad hasnt brought up my computer from home yet so I have to come down here when I need to get online to check my email or whatever I have to do for class. it seems that everything is done by computers these days. take this class for instance, I am handing in my writing assignment via some electronic force. I'm not actually handing in paper anymore. its all done so technically and confusingly. have I mentioned I absolutely hate computers? its not that I don't think theyre useful, its just that I'm not exactly copmuter friendly. well actually, I'm willing to be its friend, I just don't think it likes me too much. at home the only thing I knew how to do was check my email and write people back. oh yea, I also knew how to get to microsoft word and to solitaire, but that's about it. here there are so many options on what I can do, but don't they understand that by giving me all these options, theyre really doing me harm instead of being helpful. whoever made up computers must be very smart. sometimes I think about the things (technologies) that we live with and do in our every day lives, and it just boggles my mind. how in the world did that guy--I forget his name--- come up with a device called the telephone. I mean to even dream up of it and then to actually make it work. sound travelling through wires--- this is a crazy world. if the world had been populated with people with about as much intelligence as me, I know for a fact that we would be the most uncivilized dummy-heads roaming the earth. sometimes I wonder what the world would be like if there were none of these technologies. I don't think technologies is neccesarily such a bad, currupting thing. I mean, it is peolple who are inventing it. it doesn't come about on its own. like you know how some people think tv is so terrible, or those religions who don't allow light bulbs or radios in their homes because its like the devils advocate or whatever-- I don't see how some people believe the things that they do. I mean, wake up and think for yourself. who am I to talk, I'm not all perfect in the catagory of thinking for myself, but I probaly have a better sense of things than a lot of other people--or maybe not. life is confusing. that's probably why I'm taking comparitive value, contemporary moral problems, and psychology. can't wait to get to know myself better. 
__label__label1 I've always wondered how the mind works. What are people really thinking when they say one thing. Why do they say one thing and mean another?  People can be so confusing. I wonder what college life will be like, and if there will be people there who will act like that and just say one thing to me while meaning another. It's all so overwhelming right now. Computers have never been my strong point, and all of a sudden, everyone wants everything done on a computer. It's strange and somewhat exciting. I like living out on my own, without my parents watching over everything I do, but I am beginning to get a little homesick. I miss being able to see the stars at night and to feel the breeze on my face as it blows my hair back off of my neck. I went to a star party last night, and the stars were barely visible. I wanted so much to be able to see them, but I couldn't. I felt like I could cry at that moment. I didn't though, because then my friend would laugh at me. He doesn't think I'll make it here on my own. I guess I am somewhat of a Daddy's girl, but I can be alone. I enjoy being able to hear myself sometimes. I have to be alone to write poetry and to think about who I am. I wonder when I'll figure myself out. I want to be somebody important someday. I want to make other people feel welcome and to make myself feel good about helping others. I guess in a way, whenever I try to make others feel good about themselves, I'm doing it with the underlying purpose of making myself feel good. I suppose that's okay, but it seems to defeat the purpose of helping others when all I'm really accomplishing is helping myself. I think life has so many hidden points that no one will ever find all of them. I wish I could search the world over until I could find all the secrets of the history of people's actions, but that will never happen. People are so secretive that so much history is lost. There are some people that claim that it can be found, but there's got to be more exciting history out there. What would the world be like if everything interesting was discovered. Then there would be nothing to wonder about. Things would be dull for the future. I wonder if somebody across the world is taking this exact same course and writing this exact assignment right now as I'm doing. That would be the coolest thing ever. I wish on stars every night and feel that life is to be cherished. I wonder if there is another woman out there with my exact feelings and thoughts, that looks exactly like me, only another color maybe or size. So many questions I ask myself will never be answered, but what if someone is watching me right now across this computer lab and wondering how I feel and what I'm thinking at this very moment. If only I knew, maybe I could meet up with this person and tell him/her my thoughts. I would love to share with someone I don't know. I'm afraid of rejection though. There are so many people on this campus, and hardly anyone has talked to me yet. Somehow I feel inferior to some of them. I don't know why. Everyone is equal, but some people seem so rude. I try to talk to people in my class, because that is how you make friends. So far, I have only made one friend that way. She's really nice. Her name is PROPNAME. I met her in my German class, and we get along really well. We haven't done anything outside of class, but maybe if we keep talking to each other, we'll become closer and maybe she'll even go home with me to visit my parents. I don't understand the need for human contact. We would be so much better off if we didn't get caught up in emotions and feelings. But then again, we wouldn't be human if that didn't happen. I know I could be more efficient if I didn't need anyone else in the world, but as it is, I have faults. That's okay, though. Everyone has faults. It's just part of being human. I hope the world is full of exciting adventures for me. As I come to a close on my writing, I feel purged of all my frustrations. I had a good cry this afternoon. I miss my boyfriend so much, but I know I'll see him again soon, and that makes me very happy. I hope I can become even happier with where I am now. Hopefully, I'll be able to find me. 
__label__label1 first, it took me a long time to get through the Austin traffic. then, when I got home, and called jenny, she wasn't ready to come over. she came over anyway even though she hadn't shaved her legs. that was kind of bad. next, I still had to deal with the fact that she had messed around with PROPNAME, one of my supposedly good friends. all they did was kiss, but it still really hurt me. she had told me that it would never happen again after she and PROPNAME messed around, but she lied. I can't believe that she did that. then I told her about the fact that I had sex with heather back during the summer, so she wasn't really happy about that, but that's understandable. I still love her, but she has really putting me to the test this weekend. hen, later on Friday night, she told me that she had liked PROPNAME, so what happened wasn't as much of an accident as I had first thought it was. come to find out, she had gotten drunk at her apartment and then called PROPNAME to come over. that's when the kiss happened. that really hurts me. so she told me that, but she still wanted to have sex with me. I agreed, I don't know why, but I did. and then, in the middle of it, she started crying, that really hurt me. then after that, she told me that she didn't even want me to come with her to college station with her. that tore me apart. I didn't know how to handle it, so I freaked, I just started yelling at her. I don't know why, I should have been more calm , but I just couldn't do it. I tried to calm myself down, but nothing worked. I still can't believe how mean I was. and then, on Saturday morning, I called her, because I thought she was going to leave without calling me like she said she would. and then, she told me that she had changed her mind, and now she didn't want me to go again. then I freaked again. I started yelling at her. I was really hurt, like id never been hurt before. I couldn't believe that anybody could hurt me this bad, but she could do it. s I called PROPNAME, and got a ride with him to college station. it took me an hour and a half to eat my ORGNAME lunch. I had lost my appetite. I was miserable. PROPNAME could see that. I got to a&m, but I had no desire to party, all I wanted to do was talk to jenny so that I could apologize to her for what I said. I ate like half my dinner. it was good but I just didn't want to eat. so, we went to the party, and I was miserable, people were drinking and all I wanted to do was talk to jenny. finally, PROPNAME gave me the number to PROPNAME's cell phone. so I called it, and PROPNAME wouldn't let me talk to jenny. then PROPNAME answered and she wouldn't let me talk to her, and then PROPNAME, her brother wouldn't let me talk to her. I was really hurt. so I got her brothers number from PROPNAME. she had given it to him. that really hurt me, that she gave her  cell phone number to PROPNAME, and her brother's number to PROPNAME. that devastated me. I just wanted to cry. it just wasn't fair. then PROPNAME called her, and convinced her to come to the party. he handed me the phone, but she really wouldn't say anything to me. I was crushed again. the one thing that I loved more than anything in this life, including myself wouldn't even talk to me. I have never felt so bad. I wanted to crawl in a hole and die, but I couldn't do that, I had to stay semihappy for the party. it was all an act, I was not happy at all. finally, at 0000 she came over. she wouldn't even acknowledge me. her roommates hate me now, and they weren't afraid to let me know. fuck PROPNAME, I hate that bitch. I have never liked her. I just want to beat her fucking head in. she is a stupid dirty whore. I don't care if she hates me, I hate her. I feel bad that cristin hates me. I like her. I really regret saying anything bad about her. then breiane came out and tried to start a fight with jenny. she claimed to be my friend. fuck her. she s a bitch. she acts like a stupid tease. she a dumb tease, she never gives anybody anything. she just likes to pretend like she's a whore. I don't really like her anymore, but it still hurts me that she doesn't want to have a friendship with me. and then, on the way home I got a speeding ticket. oh after I talked to jenny, I got a half-as hug, and then she hugged PROPNAME and didn't want to let go. then she didn't even say good-bye to me. I was hurt again. back to the speeding ticket, it was for 00 in a 00. I'm going to be fucked if my dad finds out. she didn't call me on Sunday like she said she would. that really hurt. I wanted to call her so bad, but I couldn't, I wanted to so bad, not even funny. on Monday, I talked to her for two hours, it was great, we made out. I liked it so much. she didn't call me last night. she called me this morning at 0. it woke me up. I love her, but she hasn't called me tonight yet. I really want to talk to her, so I hope that she calls me tonight. I stayed up to 0 waiting for her last night, then I fell asleep. tonight, I wont make that same choice. I'm going to go to bed early tonight. 
__label__label0 In high school I felt smart. Now I just am a face lost in the crowd. There are so many peole-so unfamiliar. What will I do?  All my friends went to different colleges. The only new people I know are my roomates-and they all have friends from high school to hang with. I feel like an outcast, like an ugly, fat, freshman, high schoolish girl. Even in my pledge class, all the other girls know each other from camp or home or watever. I have made friends though. I feel like my story is a depressing one, but I really am a happy person and I am enjoying college-being away from home. I thought that coming to college I would somehow escape the whole social thing. Obviously there is no escaping society. I was a Debutante, Neches River Festival Grand Lady-in-waiting, Senior Class Vice-President, and so much more. I was shown in the "higher" society. I hated it some, I liked it some. I guess I mainly liked the in control feeling and the attention. I went to public school, not private like most all of the people who came here from LOCNAME, so I really am not friends with mopst of the people I know. The girls I know-from home and in my pledge class-all live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I live in Towers. There again, I feel like an outcast. I feel that somehow these girls look down on me. It seems like all the girls from PROPNAME house are all so close-and I am not allowed to be a part of their "group. "  Sometimes I just want to go home and be with my friends-where I felt I belong. I am excited to be in college, but-now I'm crying-but anyway, I just feel too young. But going home would show a weakness-I can't go home-I can't show that I want to or have an interest. I have always been the strong hard-headed type that doesn't show emotions. I was sick of being at home-I like it here, but it's hard-school that is. I want to do good in school and show my parents and grandparents-that I am a worthy person and I can survive-on my own. I really am happy, but I guess it is just cold feet. It is just going to take some time to adjust and become a sociable person, again. I know I can do it-make my grades and everything-even if it means giving up a party, or two or ten. I will make it and I will succeed. I am forever changing and growing up, but I need to find who I am -as an individual and on my own rather than hide behind the shadow of my comfort zone. 
__label__label1 ever since the first day of school on august 00 I have felt so much fear. it has never hit me so hard as right now typing on a computer  not knowing one person around me yet some of them being my classmates. my thoughts of u t are hard to explain. some days are bad some good, it just depends on the day and class. I grew up in a small town went to the same school district my whole life and graduated with 00 people in my class. my psychology class has close to000. its very overwhelming . I have made a few new friends but I still feel very alone. I live with my boyfriend off campus and its hard. I just feel very alone. my parents seem to have forgotten about me, but the already had by the time my senior year had come. my brother goes to tarleton in stephenville near ft worth. my best friend goes to LOCNAME a m in college station. i'm taking 00hrs and my favorite class is swimming. I'm really bored and I want to go shopping after I get done with this writing assignment,. english is my last class today and it ended early at 0000. I'm really bored and only 00 minutes have gone by I'm tired of writing. I hate seeing all the little rich girls with their fancy clothes walking around campus. it pisses me off because I screwed up and moved into a apartment. early this morning I was in the lab signing in to use a mac. the computer told me to go to b0 so I did and when I got to the computer there was stuff on it but the computer screen had my number on it so I know to use it . but the bitch comes up and starts freaking out about it was her computer. people piss me off because my parents taught me respect and politeness and everyone at ut seems to thing that they need to be rude I just don't get it I'm thinking of transferring to LOCNAME a m because I went down there to help move my best friend into her apartment and I had the best time I've ever had. we went to a bar and I drank at the bar and I'm only 00 so we had fun you could never get away with that down here in austin. its almost time for me to stop then I'm going shopping with the little money I have. I can't wait to get off campers because boyfriends name is jimmy and he is going to go to acc in the spring to get a degree in electrical technicians he already is one but he want a degree to  get more money. it almost time to stop its almost time to stop its almost time to stop then go home it's labor day weekend and I'm so glad because were having a party at the lake house and taking the boat out to go skiing,. can't wait. well its time to stop so I'll  
__label__label0 of course I relize that things could be much worse. I mean this could be a real writing assingment, which would totally suck. I'm thinking about if I want to ask this guy to come to a show with me and my friend and her boy toy, but I don't knoe whether or not I will probably not. I just e-mailed my mom - I had never used e-mail before and it was quite an experience of course now I'm wondering how in the hell I'm supposed to get this little disk thingy out of the stupid computer I'm the most computer illiterate person that I know. college kind of sucks man it's not like on t. v. - it's much hotter. I freeze in my stupid room and roast outside no wonder everybody gets sick here. so anyway blah blah I have some dumb-ass roommate meeting to go to even though I just love my roommate to death and she of course reciprocates the feeling so we have no problems we're just one big happy family speaking of I miss my twin brother a lot he's in chicago at the art instite of chicago I just LOVE to tell people that because I am damn proud of him god typing sucks I've probably been going for abtou 00 minutesff saoe already opps little mistake there but its all good right>? I'm such a slow typer jesus christ this sux man I wonder what the next assignment is have a nice day man peace and love all around 
__label__label0 I mean. like I am really burning up. I got this really huge headache. I need some medicine. I wonder what is going on in LOCNAME right now?  I wonder if the football team won. I think I am beginning to like it there. It's a lot better than being in LOCNAME now. It's so humid. I enjoy the air in LOCNAME. Well most of it. Like the smog is getting bad up there. Other than that I  like it. I wonder what I can do while I am here. There is like no one here anymore. My whole life is still in LOCNAME. Hmm. I wonder who I should go back to UT with? Tai or PROPNAME?  As long as they can fit all my stuff it's all good. I hope I cam get my computer up there soon. I can finally feel I am back in contact with the rest of the world. I hope I get a really awesome computer. I can finally quit begging my roommate to use his computer. Just asking him to use is it is like a big master plan. He is so protective of his computer. But that's ok. once he sees this 'baby' that I got, it's going to be a whole different ball game! rrHahahah. Even though I had some problems with my roommate at first, now things are a little better. I can actually open the door wide open!! What a luxury!! Oh jeez I forgot to do my laundry!!  I better to do before I go back to UT. I'll have stinky clothes everywhere. I got to get some CDs from my friend before I go back to. Free games and software for my computer. Ultimate hook up!.  And food for when I get back to UT. That Jester food can really get to you. I swear sometimes I think they have fillers in there are something. Cause. I can usually eat like a lot. but at Jester. I can eat a hamburger and get full instantly!. But there food. I think is not too healthy. so I find myself going to PROPNAME gym more often now. I never used to workout in high school cause you had to pay membership just to get in. Good thing PROPNAME is free as long as you are a student there. I feel healthier now then when I was in high school. I played tennis for high school,  but. I get more satisfaction when I can workout when I want to than. continuously playing. I get burnt out easily that way. 
__label__label1 He became my good friend and we had an understanding, we connected. He left this morning. We saw him off. His mom was there so the send off wasn't so bad. The other guys are afraid to show emotion. They've got this macho, I'm afraid to feel attitude. They're smart and all but maybe not as expressive as my close friends back home. Guess that comes with time. The cheebye had to leave so damned fast. 0 week and one day's notice was all he had. And all of us, especially me, feel so betrayed. We had great plans for this summer and the fall. At least I'll be seeing him in december when I fly back home. I like stuffed toys. Beanie babies rock! but. I have to watch my spending, yeah, too many beanies'll break my bank! college isn't all that cheap. I'm not a  loaded person. I've got to think about my budget for this month. sheesh, I've  already overspent and am going to be stretched till october. cheebye!  I wonder if anybody's going to read this rambling. if somebody is, hmmmm. you can  call me. I'm "new" to america and don't have any american friends. sad isn;t it? but that is the case. what's the point of going overseas for an education if you  don't imerse youself into the country's culture.   oh well. I've got lot's of things to do now. like get my "lunch". I'm starving. hmmm.              
__label__label1 I am happy that I made the transition from ORGNAME ORGNAME to ORGNAME. I am cautious about my future and what I want to get involved in. I want to become a Texas Wrangler but I am unsure that they will take me. I want to do well in school and get in to law school. I don't study as much as I want to, and I need to work on that. I love sports and I like football most of all. I wish I had played football was a kid. I am excited about the future of our country and I want to get involved. I don't understand what this assignment is about, but I will write everything that is on my mind. I worry a lot about stuff that is of no concern to me. I try to be the best student and person that I can be. I have a lot of pressure on me from my past and the way I have been raised. I've always been a good student and pretty athletic, and I try to be the best at everything. I knew that is bad, but I feel that that is the way I was born. I believe our President is guilty and should be impeached for the good of the nation. He is a smart man, but he is personally corrupt. I have a roommate that is good. He is Norwegian and is a great student. He is fun to hang out with and we get along well. I have a girlfriend and I'm not sure if we should stay together. We get along well, but I feel like I have the whole world at my fingertips, and she is holding me down. ,  WE share a lot together and we are best friends, but she wants more. more time, more money. etc. My parents are strong Christians, but ?I am not sure that that is what I want. College is a time to figure all of this out, and I am glad I am here. It is a fun place and the knowledge here is overwhelming. I am like a sponge trying to get it all in my head. I want to be an attorney and I feel like al the knowledge will make me a better lawyer. I want to be the best that I can be and make a good future for myself. My Mom never went to college so she wants me to make the most of it. It is a lot of pressure from her, and I try to be a role model for my younger brother. He is a trouble maker, and I want to be a positive influence in his life. He is a good kid, but the friends he is with are not good for him. I love my family very much. I can't wait for the UT ORGNAME football game. I love the game and I love the school spirit it provides. I was an engineering major at ORGNAME ORGNAME last year and I made the switch to UT all by myself. I am proud of that move, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It was the best move I've ever made. I like the big school here and the number of students here. I want to run for public office when I get older and make this country a better place. I feel like I can be a good leader and bring good things to this country. I am a good person, and I believe others will think so too.  
__label__label1 I honestly have no earthly idea. I just woke up about 0 hours ago. Drop off my younger sister at her school, which is my old high school. My boyfriend is still a senior there. At times it is awkward going there but at the same time very comfortable. I brought my (old) teacher  a lot of buckets for the upcoming carnival for the little kids. I enjoy bringing her to school 0, because I remember how horrible bus rides were. So I never rode it. Actually I rode it 0yrs in middle school, because my mom could not drop me off. And secondly I get to see my PROPNAME. It is weird being in a relationship, not because it is uncomfortable. More like it is a different experience. I never really had a relationship until my senior year. It really isn't hard balancing my priorities. My number one priority is finishing school. Hey, I realized that my typing isn't as bad as I thought. I still have to look at the keys at times. Back to PROPNAME. He really is an extremely wonderful person, cute, good husband material( not that I am thinking about that right now) It's just that it really is hard to find someone genuinely nice and sincere to everyone, and especially you. I think it just sucks that he is my first true relationship. Because, the old notion that the first most likely isn't the last. Only time will tell. It's about 00:00 and I didn't go to work today. Instead, I am doing this lovely assignment. Excuse my typing, I am not that good. Oh, I know what else I am thinking. My big 00 B-Day is coming up, and my dad is still holding strict control over me. Like I am twelve all over again. He doesn't realize that I am growing up and staying home this year doesn't help. Although, I love my home and mother. I only wish certain straining attitudes would alter. My first class today is math 000G. oh, boy! My teacher is actually, pretty nice. Right now it  is much more of a review, and my homework assignment is due today also. There were only actually a few problems that I quite couldn't recall. I just have to practice on more problems. I am not at all surprised of my needed review. The problems were wonderful word problems which I have never seemed to master without practice. Well look here it is three minutes past my 00 minutes. and these people are becoming a little antsy (I think that is how you spell it) about time limits. Oh, if you actually do read any parts of these assignment  I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE I JUST WAS THINKING THAT YOUR CLASS IS ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE. AND I HOPE TO MEET ONE DAY NEXT WEEK, INSTEAD OF BEING A NUMBER IN YOUR 00000000 PERSON CLASS. (JUST A LITTLE PLAY WITH NUMBERS) Adios, till we meet again for the next writing assignment. Which I'll do tomorrow, because we can't do 0 in one day. Bye                            WRITING ASSIGNMENT 0                             000000000 
__label__label1 It is not as though they dit down and say "hey, I'm going to change who I am today, just for the fun of it!" and if they do they aren't serious about changing. I have changed. A lot. It almost scares me how I have evolved as a person over the past several months. My thoughts have changed, how I view myself and other people, how I respond to certain situations, my opinions, beliefs, morals, attitudes; they have all been dramatically altered since this time last year. The funny thing about this is the reason why. I always considered myself to be a person set in my ways, never to step out of bounds, never to go against what I thought was socially acceptable. On a small scale, I was my own person, unique in every way, but in the scheme of life, I was right there with every other middle class high school girl. Trying to fit in, to wear the coolest clothes, listen to top 00 music, go to all the parties to make and appearance and be friends with certain people just because they were "popular". Then I met PROPNAME, and I realized that there was so much more to life that what I was used to. The world wasn't one big happy carousel, spinning and singing and whoever got the prettiest horse was best. No, that's not how it was. There were problems in the world, and I realized that I had been ignorant to them, and it wasn't right. I came to realize that there is so much hatred and apathy out there, and it's tolerated. Not accepted, but tolerated, and that's wrong to. PROPNAME taught me that it's okay to stand up for what I believe in, even if everyone else wasn't doing it, to do it for myself. Not to condone the racism, sexism, homophobia and bigotry that goes on behind closed doors. If we ignore it, it will only fester and grown until there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. I began to realize then that it doesn't matter if you're wearing Polo jeans, or if your parents just bought you a  brand new ORGNAME, because in the scheme of things, it's all irrelevant and pointless. This message was made clear to me through PROPNAME and the music we listen to. It's okay to be different, it's okay to spike your hair and pierce your eyebrow, because the people who frown upon you for doing so are the people who are afraid of change, the same people that tolerate that same hatred I previously mentioned. It's okay for me to be different as long I know that I'm doing what's rights, and the two should never be confused. You can be considered a social outcast and still contribute more to the well being of society than some big shot in his three piece armani suit, (the epitome of luxury that most people in LOCNAME idolize today) sitting behind his desk letting his greed for power and money boil into hatred to the point that he will step over all those "lower" than him to get what he want's. This isn't right. Yet this is the American dream. What is wrong with this picture?  
__label__label0 The reason being is because I am in good health, I do not have problems studying in my classes, and I have now set a routine where I can exercise, study and have fun at the same time. I do have long days on my classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, but when I get through them I recover on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Last year I was not as fortunate with my schedule and my health. I had problems that required I go to a doctor and have x-rays done as well as other tests. Many of the friends of my family also passed away during that year and I was also trying to get myself used to the transition from highschool to college while taking some pretty difficult courses. Overall, I was having a tough time adjusting. I had to miss several classes in order to go in and check what my health problems were. I sometimes even had problems walking at U. T. because of the pains I would feel and did not always fully concentrate on what I needed to. I also seemed to have more distractions my freshmen year and did not always study like I should have. I still made pretty decent grades but I feel I could have done better. Compared to then, life is good. My emotions are better intact, I do not get as nervous as I used to be, and I do not get embarrassed easily to answer questions in class like I used to. I also seem to tolerate more in terms of the differences in people. I still want people to know that I consider God to be important even though they may not. Some people used to tell me that I would change as soon as I entered college and would become like everybody else. I haven't and I want people to understand that even though I may be alone in a lot of issues, I will stand alone and not follow what I don't believe to be true. Sometimes I do not appreciate the fact that some professors don't really care about those in the class who regard God as important and ridicule every person who may believe in that way. I feel sometimes that as a student respects a professor in some of their opinions, then a professor should also respect the student likewise. I do, however, express my feelings to the professor if I feel they are not correctly handling the situation. I do hope the professor does not feel it is an attack on my part and I try to get my points across as diplomatically as I can. With most that I have talked to, I get a pretty good response and we are able to work things out. I do have strong feelings but I hope I do not have to express them in a way that nobody wants to hear. I'm willing to work things out, and I hope that the other individual involved would be the same. 
__label__label0 First of all is my class ME 000. I don't want to be taking it at the moment but I will have to take it sooner or later. I am not good at drawing and that is what the class is mainly about. I would love to learn how to do that but I just wish I didn't have to get a grade. I am more worried abut that class than I am about second year cal. I could postpone the class and take it later, maybe during the summer, but I don't know. It will be a hard class for me. The other thing that is on my mind is whether or not I should play baseball. That is a very complicated subject for me. I would be a walk-on. However, several people who know have told me  that I could easily make the team. On the other hand, that would be very time consuming. I have a girlfriend back in LOCNAME who is still in high school and I really want to be able to see her. I am afraid that If I played baseball then I would never be able to go home. Also, I am an aerospace engineer and I will have a lot to do besides. The other side is that I have the ability to play and if I don't then I will look back and wish that I had. I have had to deal with this issue all summer. If I do play baseball then I will likely have to change my schedule. On the other hand I think that one of the reasons that I don't want to play is because I might be afraid of not making the team or of upper classmen or scholarship player harassment if I did make the team. People have always told me not to take my girlfriend into consideration when making my decision but I can't do that. They all think that just because I am going off to college that I will find a new girlfriend, and I may, but I don't want to and It won't be anytime soon. We've already talked about marriage and how when she graduates from high school she could come live with me. She is a junior right now so she has two more years. I would love it if we could be living with each other right now. In the year that we have been going out we have never had an argument. I enjoy her company so much. Well that is what is on my mind at the moment.   
__label__label1 Well I have been thinking about a dream I had last night which was bothersome. I have only vomitted twice in my life and so my dream had to do with me throwing up all over the place and in my dream I was trying to wake up from the dream because I don't like throwing up. I was also thinking about all of my school work. I am very frustrated with the pre-testing website because I can never get on it. There always seems to be some sort of technical difficulty, and I don't know what to do about it and so I came up with one solution and that is to get ORGNAME ORGNAME but that also didnt work out like I had hoped. So I tried to see if there was a problem with my Internet provider so that whole thing is causing a lot of frustration for me. Well I don't like thinking about it too much because I am hoping sometime between now and September 00th my problem willl be solved. I am also overwhelmed in my spanisk 000L class which my last semester of a language and it is very difficult and I dread going to class every MWF from 00-0. As I am writing this I keep thinking about how the instructions of this assignment says not to worry about grammar but I still have to make sure that I haved spelled every word correctly not so much the punctuation but the spelling. This assignment is very fun for me. Also I am thinking about the conversation my roommates and I had last night about God right after we were discussing God in class on Monday. We had a two or so hour conversation about death and God after I had stated that the ONE subject that I do not like talking about is death. So ofcourse we talk about death and then we go on to have a deep conversation which is something I enjoy doing from time to time just to see what other people feel about certain topics. I am also constantly thinking about guys that I used to know in high school and the one or two that are a year younger than me that I still talk to and that have at one point or another had an attraction to but don't know what will come of it meaning whether or not I will stay friends with the two boys as time goes on. I am also thinking about what is going on on the television show that is on in my room. It has to do with sexual harassment and it is the guy accusing the woman of sexual harassment at a ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. And he won the landmark case. It is funny because the comedy show that was on prior to the present show had to do with the same issue. Well that is all --- This assignment was very pleasing to me because I enjoy doing assignment like this. 
__label__label0 It was very frustrating to get on to the web site. However, the weekends are fun. I get to see my friends that are not at this school. This weekend I went home to see one ORGNAME my friends who signed with the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also got to see two of my best friends that are guys. One goes to ORGNAME and the other goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME college. He was supposed to go to LOCNAME to swim, but two days before school started, he called, and they told him that his spot on the team was gone. Now he is writing other colleges and the ORGNAME coach called him. If he does not swim, he will probably come here next semester. I also got to see my boyfriend. He goes to ORGNAME. He was my best friend first and now we are together. It is great. However, I miss him a lot. He is the sweetest guy I know. Anyway, right now I am borrowing a friends computer because mine doesn't work. It is really a pain. I need to go tomorrow to the computer to have them install my Ethernet card. It is not compatible with my laptop. I am right now in the school of business. However, I am really interested in psychology, and am thinking of changing my major. My dad thinks this is a terrible idea. My mom thinks I should do what will make me happy. I guess I need to get as much information as I can about the type of jobs that I can get with a psychology degree and the amount of school I will have to complete. I will also need to see what schools have good psychology departments. I really do not want to go here next year. I want to go somewhere smaller with less freaks. I will probably stay in the state. I will probably go to ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Oh well, I guess I have a while to decide. 
__label__label1 I have gone to three computer labs this morning, and have gotten screwed out of all of them. It started over at the ORGNAME, where I signed up for a Mac, but saw a free scanner, When I sat down and logged in at the scanner, I realized my other assignment had come up. I decided to logout of the scanner because you're not supposed to use a scanner computer if you're not going to scan anything. So I went over to my assignment, but it was someone else's computer!  So I decided to sign up again (disgruntled). This time, though, the line was about a mile long (not really, but still REALLY long). About half way through the line, and a few minutes later, I realize that I had been assigned to a different computer, but my time was almost up. So I ran over to the computer and quickly typed in my password, but it wouldn't take it. I desperately attempted to logon before my time was up, but the insolent computer would not give it up!  Now a little less than happy, and a little more than frustrated, I went back to the line. Only this time it was at least twice as long. NO!  I remembered though, my MISS professor talking about a business lab, so I went over to the CBA. Of course it was on the 0th floor, and one of the escalator's was broken, but I made it up there; just to find out I had to sign up and wait a day so they knew I was a business student. How asinine!  So I signed up (trying to dig my pen into the page) and proceeded to the good old PROPNAME laboratory, where there is always room to work. There were plenty of computers when I arrived, so I sat down (a little relieved) and pulled up Netscape. The soul purpose of my computer escapades was to check my email and to do this darned project, so I tried to get into my account. "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?". What? "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?" Damn it. Of course, the computer couldn't do email. SO I switched. Same song, second verse. I tried three others, and still the same chorus: "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?". So I accepted the fact that somebody doesn't want me on email. I'm now trying to drudge through this assignment without breaking anything. And yes, time flies when you're having fun, but it moves as slow as hell when you're pissed off, wet, and hungry. That's about the only thing I have to look forward to now: eating. Luckily I packed myself a lunch today. Last time I neglected that responsibility and was forced to eat at ORGNAME's. $0, and I felt like cap for the rest of the day. I'm trying to stay healthy. You see, last semester, I worked out really hard, and got pretty buff before the end of school, but throughout the summer, I lost access to the gyms, and I lost a lot of my muscle mass. Now I am struggling to get back in the swing of things, and fast food really sets me back!  You can add that to the list of anxieties, too. Working out for the first week is always hell, but now I'm on Creatine, and I am twice as sore. Of course, now my hands are hurting from typing straight for 00 minutes, but that is bearable. I guess I sound like quite the whiner, but I am really an easy going guy. I always try to have a pleasant disposition; I really do, I walk around making a constant effort to keep a smile on my face ( It also makes it easier to wink at the girls). But today, things just aren't going well. I really wanted to check that email because I'm supposed to be getting a message from this GORGEOUS girl. But oh well, maybe my lack of correspondence will serve as "playing hard to get". Well, 00 minutes is up, and my hands need a rest!  Hope this is what you all wanted! 
__label__label1 I thought the whole thing was ridiculous. Most of the questions were so obvious. I was getting frustrated at how dumb some of those questions were getting. They might as well be asking us to recite the alphabet. I can understand wanting our opinions about things, but they should have reworded their questions. Some of those questions made my roommate and I feel kind of stupid to be answering them. Anyway, right now I actually have a lot of things on my mind. I'm homesick, concerned about my classes, and excited about college all at once. I'm adjusting quite well to such a big change in my life. At first, I was constantly lost, frustrated, and worried, but I'm doing much better now that I've met so many people and overcome so many of my fears. I'm not sure what else to write, but I'll continue simply because it hasn't been 00 minutes. I'm loving UT right now, and I'm definitely glad I came here. My roommate and I get along great. We have a lot in common. We just work so well together. 
__label__label1 I am a sophomore at LOCNAME. I am very excited about doing this assignment because I just received my email account. The whole technology thing really amazes me. I am very excited about taking this class because I am interested in the study of people and how their minds work. I am a little undecided on my major, and who knows:  this may be my calling. Well, maybe!  This is very fun for me being here on the world wide web. I feel like I've been in the dark for so long. I'm sitting here wondering what the people around me are doing?  Are they browsing or doing actual work. My guess is that they're doing important stuff, like I am doing. I'm looking forward to exploring other websites after this because like I said this is my first time on line. Now I can talk to my international friends and actually be in contact with my professors and teaching assistants. I have no idea how I made it through a whole year without an account. I guess that's why I missed a lot of posted assignments. O. K. now my hands are getting tired because it's been a whole summer since I've actually done work. But let me tell you it was a pretty exciting summer. I saw friends that I haven't seen in a while and had some wild and crazy times. I should have gone home to save money, but instead I stayed in a very expensive apartment on LOCNAME LOCNAME and spent all the money I worked so hard for on bills, etc. I am a waitress at Cafe PROPNAME's. It's a bit fun at times, and I make money on occasion. It really makes my whole opinion and view of people change. I mean, I really try to respect everyone for who they are, but when you're constantly waiting hand and foot on a bunch of stingy, angry people it kind of gets you down on people as a whole. It's a fun environment behind the scenes. I have some fun times with some great friends. We goof off and joke around, and we even hang out after work. I'll have to cut back on the hanging out part with school starting again. My boss thought it was a good idea to work me 00 hours this week. So, I'm pulling my hair out here. I'll tell her tomorrow that I cannot work this much while taking classes. I'll have a nervous breakdown. I do need the hours to pay bills, but I might be able to make it with only a few shifts a week. After all waitressing pays pretty good money when the business is there, you know. If all else fails, I'll beg my parents for a loan. whew now my hands are really tired. I realize that this is nothing compared to some of the stuff I will be writing; however, I still need to get warmed up for the semester. God, I can't wait until Christmas break. I love the holidays so much. I'm never in such a good mood as I am then, unless I have just been dumped by the man of my dreams which doesn't happen every year but it does and that is wh0y my feelings towards men is a very negative one. Actually I love the opposite sex, but at the same time I want to kill every one of them. Actually I am just waiting for Mr. PROPNAME and when I settle for Mr. alright for now that's when the crap hits the fan. Well it's been fun but my time's up. I guess I'll visit next time for assignment 0. Later! 
__label__label0 You all are going to read this and say, Who the heck is this freak? The first day of the semester. I¹m tired already. I want to change to world half the time and it¹s not at all working. I hate people sometimes and I like them the next. How can people lie to you, straight to your face and still not have any trouble what so ever sleeping. Have we no morals at all? All I can think of as I return once again to the glorious LOCNAME campus is how everyone is just paying to party; paying to drink, dance and meet people. I want to learn, but I want to have fun too. I can¹t believe that all anyone thinks about anymore is the same old same old; drugs-alcohol, sex and rock and roll okay so maybe it¹s more R&B now a days. I must be warped. I want someone to tell me yeah it was a great weekend because I got to go here or there and I met with my friend so and so. Not Hey it was a great weekend, I got some chick to come back to my dorm and I got plastered. What is that? Am I the only one who thinks this way? I can¹t be. It just can¹t be that rare that I would be the only one who would want to do something besides drink and party 00/0. I must be jaded. Yes, I¹m a junior. Yes I¹ve been here a lot longer than half of these kids, fish, in our PSY class. But still, the campus is still a new place to me. Everyday is something new. I learn something new. I meet a new person. Something, anything. But something tangible. I¹m not talking about some whim like bouncing from party to party. Being pseudo friends and all. I try to be genuine. I don¹t lie to people. I¹m friendly damn it. I used to like people. People made me this way. All the mean rotten people in this world who want to lie to my face, cheat me out of my rights or just blatantly go out of their way to be rude and downright spiteful. How rude is that? I can¹t believe what our society has come to be. I can¹t wait to start learning how some people think. What makes our brain tick. Why am I the way I am. Why  that mean lady who cut me off right on my way home is the way she is, like she didn¹t see my blinker, that¹s what that stupid little light is for. I didn¹t pay extra to just have extra decorations on my car. As if. Then she honks at me, like I was in the wrong, she knows she was speeding up to close the gap. How rude! I want to know why they think this way. Is this like the beginning of all of this Armageddon story. Is that what the 00st century is bringing our way. Why are we all fighting. And why am I so cynical when I¹m only 00. I should still be a naive little student who loves the world and everyone in it. But still. There are such things as being right and being wrong. What ever happen to a person¹s word? I want to know. There has to be others like me who think this way. I¹m not the only one who thinks we¹re wasting our time here. There are more important things to do in our world than worry about which frat is having the next party and whose dating who and all of that petty stupid little gossip things that buzz around the world everyday. You know it happens. It starts every morning at the water cooler or something like that and people just begin their little digs for the day. What is it with us. I hope humans weren¹t always this stupid, because let me tell you we¹re at a downfall here; crime, attitudes, lying, no morals, all of that. You know what I¹m talking about, don¹t you computer? I¹m babbling. I just want everything to make sense. It doesn¹t now. I don¹t know. I want the world to change, but how can it, when will it, what are we going to do. . . 
__label__label0 I miss so many things back home. I never thought I would miss anything. But I guess it's true what they say. You never know what you have until it's gone. The transition from high school is not that bad. The schooling is not the part that worries me. It's the living on my own that really worries me. I have always depended on others for my needs and now it is up to me to do it on my own. It does have it's advantages but it also has numerous disadvantages. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing back home at this very moment?  Maybe I should call and see if she is as lonely as I am. I wonder what everybody else is going to write on this same assignment. I hope I can make all A's in my classes this year. I have made straight A's forever and now I guess my parents kind of expect me to keep doing the same thing. I don't want to disappoint them in anyway. College is a very structured society. Everybody hangs pretty much with their own cliches. Like all the Frats and Sororities. Then you have the want to be frats and sororities. Then there's the people who don't care who their surrounded by. I wonder how and where I would be classified. I love this assignment. The thoughts just flow through my head like crazy and now I finally get to write them all down. Too bad nobody will probably ever read it. The mind is a very miraculous thing. I wonder how it works. And why we only use so little of it if it's so big. I wish I could go home right now to visit my friends and especially my girlfriend. I even miss my family. I never thought I would miss them. Just because I was always with them and before I left we had a lot of hard times. But when I left, seeing my mother and father cry was the thing that tore me up inside. I had never seen my father cry. I really hate good-byes. Why do we always have to part from the ones we love. No matter how hard we try, there must always be good-byes. I miss all my high school friends. I wonder how everybody is doing. I wonder if we'll have a ten year reunion. I would really like to know how they are doing in ten Years. I really haven't been able to keep in touch with too many of them. Some went to the ORGNAME, others to the ORGNAME, and others to school in various places. My girlfriend is so beautiful. I really hope she is doing all right. I really care for her and she is constantly running through my mind as you can probably see. She just means so much to me and I worry about her all the time. Well, I think I have done enough thinking for right now, I will leave you now to go call her and see how she's doing. . . 
__label__label1 But I can't go to sleep because I have mounds of homework to do. The drive back here from home, just wore me out completely, and that is why I didn't have any time earlier to do my homework. I still need to take a shower. Then I have to wake up early in the morning and figure out where my biology discussion class is, so I can go in there and take the dumb quiz that the TA gives out. Too bad, I am going to fail it. The lectures my prof. gives, just don't really make since. I wish that my best friend PROPNAME and I could've spent more time together when I was home this past weekend. I also wish that my boyfriend PROPNAME would send me an email. I wish that we could somehow get passed this stupid problem we are having. It's hard enough him being in LOCNAME, then he has to go and get some weird attitude and get mad and not be himself. It is really making me mad, and sad all at once. I wish that I could see him, and knock some since into his head and then everything would be okay. PROPNAME is the only one that knows enough about us for me to talk to about our relationship problems. But I hate boring her to death with it, I don't want to get on her nerves about it. This past summer, everything was fine, and now it is all so different, I hate it. But there is nothing I can do about it. And then there is Matt which just gets on my nerves. He is my good friend from the past year, although we've known each other for going on 0 years. He just aggravates me, the way he is so scatter brained. I just get so frustrated, and tired of it. Poor guy, I feel sorry for him. Then, my mind always, swings back to PROPNAME. I can't ever not think about us, and this problem we are having. I so need to talk to him about it because I can't function unless everything is resolved. And it is driving me absolutely CRAZY. But he won't talk about it, he won't talk to me. And I am not the kind of person that can just drop it. I can't just say, oh well, and then forget about it. I have it on me for quite a long while. Every day, I see or hear at least 00 things that remind me of him or us together. Its so depressing. I hate being this way, all depressed and not my peppy, cheerful self. Well, I see that the 00 minutes are up now. SO long. 
__label__label0 I want to see my friends and my parents. can I go home? I lied to my parents. they don't like me too much right now. maybe even hate. I feel sorry. disgusted. hate for myself. I shouldn't have done that. but I'm an adult. ,I should do whatever I feel and they should just except it. turn that music off. my roommate listens to some weird stuff. what is that? it's depressing. I don't like it. it makes me homesick. why? it doesn't even remind me of home. gee, I want to listen to some rap but I'm sitting here writing continuously. is that how you spell it. it's hard to type what you think when you think it. even though they said not worry about grammar and all, I'm still worried. what if the professor thinks I'm stupid because I can't type. what if I am stupid because I can't type. thank got for backspace. anyhow, what is this for. why am I typing this. I need to do it. it's homework. I need to do homework. I feel bad. confused. wrong. should I take notes while I read in my textbooks. I don't know. I feel like an outcast when I don't take notes in my classes. should I? should I be writing down everything the professor says. should I? I'll find out when we take our first test. then when I fail, I can say now I know what to do when the problem could have been solved in the beginning by the teacher saying, please take notes because everything on the test will be from lecture. you bought the book because the university needs another way to spend money they know you don't have. ha! that was funny. okay, where was I. thinking still. I'm hungry. I can't stand the food at jester but I eat it like I've never had food before. it's just there and it tells me eat me fat boy you paid for it so eat it. I try to tell myself to find something descent like the gourmet pizza, not, or the soybean burgers but I keep getting in line to have that crappy stuff ion the choices line. never anything worth getting but I still eat it. Why? I miss home cooking, not that my mother ever cooks but ORGNAME serves as a home cooked meal for me since that is what we had for dinner a lot when I was growing up. ORGNAME is good. I like the nuggets? barbecue sauce is the bomb. one time I went to ORGNAME and they wouldn't give me any barbecue sauce. bastards. anyway, what was I talking about. so, I miss my home. I miss my friends. I called each of them the first week I was here. they all stayed at home to go to college there, or joined the military, or just didn't go to college. Oh well, their loss because it's fun up here. actually, it's fun in san antonio where I live. I would probably not be going through anything like I am here if I were to stay home. I needed this in my life, to experience new things and new people. funny though, there aren't that many Mexicans here at LOCNAME. I mean there are tons of Asians, blacks, Indians, and of course white people but there aren't that many Mexicans so I guess there are people other than Mexicans in the world because in san antonio that's all you saw. Mexicans. man my friend PROPNAME is so cool. I miss my friends from work. I used to work at cici's pizza, the best pizza value anywhere buffet for only 0. 00 you come and see us. , I always plug the restaurant to whomever I speak or whatever, anyway I don't know why because the food really sucked. yeah, it was bad. really bad. rats and roaches. that's all that comes to mind when I think of cici's. yeah, and pastries. everyone that worked there threw parties. they were the bomb. I went to so many when I worked there. anything and everything went at a cici's crew party although others were invited too. they were fun. I miss people at work. I remember dating this grill I worked with never date anyone you work with. people talk and shit happens and it really sucks. frustration. anger. anyway, that reminds me of my ex-girlfriend now. she makes me cringe. probably because of the shit she put me through but mostly because every time she left me a message she would play a song from the radio. I guess that's why it's hard to listen to the radio and not think of her. disgust. , hate. pity. sadness. mistrust. bitch. I thought she was the one. / no I didn't I just say that to sound normal. she really didn't mean a lot to me only that she loved me so I felt bad that I didn't love her so I told her I really cared for her but I didn't. I lie to everyone I guess. even myself. sadness. silence. hurt. I don't know what else to write. nothing comes to mind only blackness. I hit a chord as I wrote that. is it true. I hope not. I never mean to be dishonest. I only tell the truth to hurt people and that's wrong. not always but I just feel funny when someone feels a certain way and I don't feel that way back. you know? anyway, that's all I'm going to say about that. is there any gum around here? found some it's good. juicy fruit. is going to move you it gets right to you, the taste the taste the taste is going to move you. okay, commercial. anyway, I wish I had a tv right now. I miss cable . I love to watch comic view and ORGNAME and ORGNAME and comedy shows. tonight is seinfeld. that show is hilarious although the series finale sucked. very disappointing. I was mad. upset. I had to tape it because I had a band concert that night. band. bad memories. some good. i wish I played better so I could do something with it but I never practiced on my instrument. I never applied myself. another hidden talent gone to waste. what about college. apply myself? hopefully and succeed. want to graduate but not too sure on them probability of it. hope so. want to please myself as well as my friends and family. don't want to let myself down but I don't know if I want it that bad. sniffle. sadness. I want to make my parents proud again before they leave this earth. death. blackness. crying. . 
__label__label0 This is kind of difficult to do, because I am still in school mode, and it is hard to just right anything because I am trying to make it acceptable to a professor but I am doing my best to keep righting continuously for twenty minutes, I guess we supposed to just right what were thinking about right now, so I will tell you, I am kind of hungry and I wonder if the cafeteria is open downstairs because I am to cheap to go out and buy my own food, PROPNAME PROPNAME is kind of scary don't you think, the way his nose just kind of pokes out at you is really weird and sometimes I shudder when I see pictures of him, but I am working on getting over that right now and hopefully I will be able to watch the thriller video with out breaking down into a sobbing mess I wonder why my roommates keep the room so cold, it is like an icebox in here and my toes are always freezing, I have to go stand outside on my balcony to warm them up during the day, I wonder what I will do during the winter when I can't use the sun to warm my toes I guess I will just have to buy a footbath I am excited about the video music awards coming on tonight because they are always good for a few good laughs but I have to run now so I will see you kids later 
__label__label1 I really miss my home town, but only because I'm not comfortable in my new surroundings. my friends seem short- lived and artificial, and my classes seem all too real and incredibly healthy. I'm constantly worrying that I'll fail and I seem to be hanging out with my thoughts too much, sometimes I feel they are a bad influence on me. I'm only happy when I'm doing something, and people tell me it's because I don't like to deal with my problems. it's true, but at this time I don't care. I have a hard time concentrating, sometimes I wonder if I have ADD. I probably don't , but I like to think I do. they call that a hypochondriac right? I have a question: does  believing you are a hypochondriac mean that you are suffering from something else? I hope so, petty mental problems are better that physical problems. 
__label__label0 I don't really want to do this assignment, I think it's tedious and I want to go to sleep. I haven't had much rest lately, but socializing with my friends is important to me too. I want to study, but I'm totally lost at what I want to do because I have so much work to do. I think I will study psychology first before I study my EE book. I miss my brother, he's so cool. Looking around the room, it feels full, but empty at the same time. This music in the background is cool, I'm glad I burned the cd today. I hope my dorm mates don't get mad that I'm turning it up so loud. I don't really care that much though. I want to go do something besides work. Everyone around here is studying, but I am not. I feel like I'm forgetting to study for something. I wish I went to see that movie last night, It sounded really cool. My neighbors are great, but I don't know if their real or fakes. i am so cynical. I don't understand why I don't trust anyone. I wish I could trust people more, but I think I trust too much already. I don't know. I think I'm going to call an old friend today, see if he wants to do something. LOCNAME seems so far away from here, I miss my family. I don't understand why people don't miss their family here, I seem to be the only one. I try to call them everyday, but it seems like the telephone conversations isn't enough. I want them to be near me. The houses around here look really beat up and old, maybe they should live a little farther away. The concert I went to was pretty cool. i had a good time. It was strange, off all the concerts I went to, this one had a lot of good looking girls. It must be the type of music it is. I wish my taste in music was more targeted to good looking girls. But, I hate the music those girls listen to, it's so bad. I don't understand how they can listen to such garbage. Man, my trash can is full, when I'm done I think I'll throw out the trash. Why do people keep leaving garbage in here, it's not just us. I hope that my computer doesn't crash again. It's built well, but I seem to be slacking off on computer studying. I don't know as much as I did or wish to. I love computers so much though. I wish I could be rich like those million or billionaires. But, then again, I don't want to be too greedy, maybe if I could just provide enough for my family. I think I wouldn't like to be rich, maybe just comfortable and liking what I do. I hope EE is what I like to do, my decision making ability is really putrid. I don't think I like writing this. My hands are getting kinda strained. I think I'm going to go and throw away the trash, oh wait, I still have another assignment to do, wow, I'm glad I remembered to do this assignment, I don't want a bad grade only 0 weeks into the school year. Okay, I think I want to finish this up. Thank you for listening to my psycho-babble, I hope it benefits you more than it ever did for me. okay. I think ill stop now. bye. 
__label__label1 When asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. Let me see. well today I went to this Sigma Phi Omega Rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. Everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? Or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. During this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. One of the question was "What quality do you have to contribute to the organization?"  The thing was I couldn't think of anything to say. I mean I am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. I am just me. Isn't that enough? Then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! How embarrasing! They asked questions that will catch you by surprise! Like "What song best describes you?" I was like ummmmmmmmmmm OH OH the first thing that popped in my mind was Butterfly by PROPNAME PROPNAME. I just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though I had no idea at the time what Butterfly was about or was talking about. I wonder if they know!? Oh well. I've been debating with my friends if I should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. The only thing that I am worried about is will they accept me for who I am or do I have to be the typical sorority chic? and I forgot to mention. Pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 0 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 0 weeks!  DO we have to clean toilets or what? Maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the Rushees know about it they will think again before they join. Makes me wonder what pledging is all about. A lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. I would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but I can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? It's just that some people I meet is just that I have no idea what to talk about, it is as if I freeze and don't know what to say. It is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. I think the reason why I sometimes feel that way, is that I feel intimidated and I feel really awkward. Like I do right now because I feel like I am runing out of things to say. Actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. Just to go to Rush events I have spent approximately 0 hours already and I haven't even been in it yet. It was for two organizations. Tomorrow is the party and I am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside I want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the Club. Lately I have been lazy and haven't been doing much but I promise myself that I will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. And if they ever find out I went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. But I think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. I guess going and Rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I feel. 
__label__label1 While sitting on my computer many thougts and feelings come into my head. I have now been at school for alsmost 0 weeks and I can't believe it. School is finally becoming a reality. It has just started to feel like home. I am from out of state and when I came to school I felt like I was at sleep a way camp trying to meet my friends for the next month. It is true I am not at camp anymore. It has been hard for me lately because I miss home. I miss my family and friends. It seemed to me at the beginning of school that everyone new each and I was the outcast. It has been hard finding friends even though everyone is very nice. It is different here because my closest friends aren't here with me. I came from a very close group of friends and we each went different directions. I am ready to meet new people but I want them to be like my best friends at home and that is not gooing to happen. I have to understand that I will become close to the people here at school I just have to give it time. I also miss my family tremendusly. I am very close to my family and try to talk to them at least once a day but talking is not the same a seeing them. It is very wierd not seeing my sister. We are 0 years apart but we are extremly close. Every time I talk to her I get a tear in my eye. The thought of not seeing her for another month makes me very upset. She told me the other day that she felt like I was on a trip and coming home. She tells me all the time how much she misses me and that makes the situation worse. I can't wait to see her and my parents. I have a very unique realationship with my parents. They are also like my best friends. I feel I can tell them anything. The are my inspiratin and my confindence in one. I have had a lot on my ming latly about school I am very nervous about all the work and tests. I feel as though it is going to be a lot harder that high school. It has been very hard to get back into the school mode but I am starting to get back in to it. I have had a lot of distractions latly with the sorority and and tring to meet eveyone to make friends but I realize I have to start putting school in front of all that. I am here for school and I need to start putting effort in to it. I am very dilgent and like to get my work done but I don't want to stress myself out. Even though school is very important I still need to have fun. I need to balence myself. I feel that it might take some time to get adjusted but it will all work out. School has definately been tough but it has resently gotten better and I know it will get better each day I am here. I am so glad that I made the decision to come to ORGNAME and experience this great school.       
__label__label1 Presently my thought are on my sororities 00th Anniversary this weekend. So far I have not ben able to find a place to get my hair done; which is a problem because I have very long hair. The guy that I am going with is pretty cool. We met about a week and a half ago and things are going well. Since, I have no family coming in for parents weekend I am probably going to ask him to the game but I am not sure. I mean I enjoy his company and all but the shortness of time that I have known him and that is not for 0 weeks. I don't know what to do about it but I have to ask before midnight because I need his ID so that he can be in my sororoties block at the game. Being new around here and not knowing many people is a problem when you need dates for all kinds of things. It is hard to go up and ask a guy to something who you have only talked to once or none. It's difficult being from out of state. It seems like everyone else knows everyone else. I knowe that this is not true but that is how it seems. Getting used to the whole college thing is different. I do have my sister around so that is nice but I have not lived near her for four years so in a way it is kind of strange as well. I had a bought of homesickness last week. I tried to call my best friend to hear a friendly voice but she was not home. My other best friend was there and I talked to her, well woke her up and said hi-bye kind of thing. The net was my only way to talk to them then without disturbing anyone else because my third best freind has not left for college yet. I wrote her a long letter via email and poured my heart out. With just meeting people it is kind of hard to cry on someones shoulder . I don't know I just don't like to cry in front of poeple who I do not know. don't want them to know that I have a weakness. To everyone else I like to come off as a very stronge and together person who can handle any situation. Plus, the people hear do not know me well at all and for me to start spewing off all of my problems or thoughts might put a burden on someone else or drive them away. It takes a lot for me to be able to trust someone with my feeling. My car, my clothes, anything else but not my soul. Living with another person who I had never met before was an experience unto itself. The first morning at 0:00am her boyfreind was over and stayed the entire weekend. I am glad that she is enjoying her freedom away form home but not in my room when I barely knew her. I don't like having to stay in friends rooms my first weekend at school. It just was not cool because I had just met all of them, tooo. Just a bad situation all together. I just do not like being put in that situation. I won't do it to her. If I want to hang with one of my guy friends to al hoursa of the morning I go to his place or in the lounge or something. That is just not write. Typing non-stop like this is kind of difficult. I never took tying so I am constantly looking at the keys and thinking that I am running out of things to say with much time left. Funny how your mind sort of goes blank when asked to talk about such a loose subject as your thoughts. Not too much longer. I am most of the way there. Lack of thoughts here. It is interesting to move away and to think about how different things would be if so and so did not choose this school. The girl who I have found that I have connected is from out of state too. If I didn't have her I do not know what I would do. We did not get into the same sororities but that is cool because now instaed of gluing to eachother we are meeting many other poeople. It's definitely different here than in LOCNAME. The manner that peopel have and the culture and such. I am so excited that for one of my theatre classes I get to go see the play Vieaux Carre which I am believing is based in New Olreans although I have never heard of it before. I know A Street Car Named Desire but not that one. I just do not know.

YEA!!! TIME'S UP!!! 
__label__label0 Okay, I think this is going to be hard for me to do because honestly I'm not sure if someone will be reading this and if they will think that what I say is stupid or I am doing it wrong but perhaps that is a stupid thing to say also since I just clearly read that there is no right or wrong thing to say. so basically I have just entered this new sort of world. I am now what I would call a real person. that is, I am no longer totally dependent on a parental figure or figures as it were. this is like a whole new life for me. right now I suppose I am lonely, living by myself and so from this statement stems the thought that has haunted me for days: should I be living in a dorm instead of my own apartment and I could go on and on thinking this but I will always come to the same conclusion. And that is that either way there are advantages and disadvantages, and besides that there is no reason to play the what if game because I already live in an apartment and there is no way that I could even get into a dorm at this point. But I know that that is my nature. That is, to think about things that I can't change. I always wonder well, if I had done it that way then this would have happened or wouldnt have happened. I hate that I do that. there really is no point. I can't change the past so I don't really understand why I waste the present regretting past decisions or thinking about what could have been if only. of course, I have tons of regrets in my life. maybe I just I don't know. I honestly don't know why I can't just be happy with the decisions I make for myself. it all goes back to my stupid nature of always envying other people. I tend to look at what they have and think that I could be like that if only I. it could be any thing. I just hate always being envious of others and thinking that they are better than me because. the list could go on and on. Really I don't know why I am not satisfied with the way I am. I mean I know that I don't have self esteem problems but still I am always thinking that I need some sort of improvement. I really should be happy with myself. I have done a lot of good things for myself and I have a lot going for me unlike others for example tracy walker. but still I can take a person like that and still find things in her that I envy. I must say that is pretty pathetic of me. w wish I knw why I even cared about tracy or the whole lake dallas crew. I mean, I spent my whole life with these people playing the little game that everyone played the lake dallas way all up until my last year when I realized how unbelievably stupid it all was. its weird how my junior and senior year my outlook on life totally changed from the way that I saw things my freshman and sophomore year. now there is a time that I wish I could go back to. I hadnt made any stupid mistakes yet. I didnt have any enemies I had tons of friends I was secure with myself and for christ sake I wore a freaking size 0. lord, life was good back then and I really just wish that I could go back to it sometimes. I am beginning to wonder if life will ever be as great as it was then. I know that sounds pathetic but I still have to wonder. everyone days college is so great but I just hope that the social aspect will pick up soon. I feel as if I am behind or maybe I just don't know how to have fun like I used to. I think that I just need to find friends that I am truly comfortable with and a boyfriend wouldnt be bad either. 
__label__label1 Right now I'm sitting at my computer at home trying to decipher a way to buy a new truck. How can I find the right truck that's cool for me, is affordable, and will last without much repair. Well I guess the first thing to do would be to go around to dealerships and research prices and selection on the market. That sounds like a wonderful idea and tomorrow would be a perfect day to go out and do that with my dad, but there is one problem. Which is I am pledging a fraternity right now and should be up at the house tomorrow to be with my pledge brothers. This gets me right back into deciding what my priorties are. So far since school started I have dealt more with priorties in two weeks than ever in my life. I have had to be more definitive with decisions and stand behind them because they are so important now. I want to do so much stuff like join a frat, hang out with friends from high school, buy a truck, get good grades, meet people, and keep up with my girlfriend in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Now that's been the most pressing issue on my mind at all times. I got a girl that I'm in love with at school across the country and talk to her every day. Is it possible that I can expect our relationship to work out?  I know I want it to, I know I want to see her and have things the way they were, but is that something I can manage. Are we going to end up on bad terms because one of us is going to meet somebody and the other will feel left out, or can we trust each other and resist tempations and stay together. It just drives me crazy to think about what she is doing all the time. Then I start wondering about my best friend who went to LOCNAME and if he is meeting new people and finding different friends. I miss having the comfort of my girlfriend and best friend around because I feel I don't act like my true self around new people. I am not trying to be fake with anyone, but I can't be comfortable and completely open around new people and I don't like that. I just hope to keep in contact with all the people that mean a lot to me, and never sell them out to new friends because I would be preety upset if that ever happened to me. Even though I got lots of new friends in my fraternity, they can never eplace the ones that I spent my time with in high school and they will never share those same experiences. 
__label__label0 Well. hmmm I'm not sure whtat to wirte here to monitor the mind I suppose  ihahve always been fascinated that the mind is the only organ that wants to study its'elf. i am a horrible typer . i'd like to think I'm fast but as what cost of accuracty. uhhhh. this is strange I'm trying to monitor my stream of consciousness but I am so aware of it as I perform this assignment that it does not seam to want to flow. i don't want to write down anything too embarrasing but why should that matter?  I'm in college not high school anymore. Social status amongst my peers really doesn't have any more bearing here. It doesn't matter what people think of me now. I don't have to worry about my appearanc all the time. though I still do. I suppose that's how shallow I am. I have to always know that I am looking good so that way I can feel good about myself. that helps me exude confidence. and that's attractive to women. But I'm not here to get a mate I'm here to get an education a degree so that way  I can be financially secure for the rest of my life but is that what the ultimate goal in life is. I think about this. is the ultimate goal in life to  make money, settle down, and start a family. to break this down means to say that we are to reproduce. buy why?  What is this necessary drive in humans and all creatures to propegate and keep the species going. basic nature to survive sure but then again why??  It seems like there should be other goals and other things to achieve in life. not necessarily to have children. will having children when I am older make me happy. i suppose so. I mean am I exactly like my father as he is exactly like his father before him. after all I'm already on the right track they both went to UT. but as much as I have fought with my dad in the past I think that I have done most everything in my life to please him and make him proud of me. I'm pretty sure that I have done that as he tells me that he is proud of me. i sure saw it in his face the day that I got my acceptance letter. i've never really seen my father cry before. but I think he  almost did when I yelled out that I'm going to be a Longhorn!!  That's something that I will never forget. the look on his face and the look on mom's. It makes me feel good to know that they are proud of me. but I have often wondered whether or not the things that I have accomplished in my life I did for myself or I did for them. i mean I have never regreted getting good grades or being in band and learning to play the trumpet. but did I do it all for myself or did I do it partly because I wanted mom and dad to be proud of me and to not have to be worried about me. hoping I won't turn out like PROPNAME. It's not that my brother is a bad person. it's his mind right. Manic-depressive with bi-polar and narcisstic tendencies. and his refusal to take his medication. why??  I never understood what was so hard about taking his meds. he'd be fine but instead he chose drugs and alcohol. it's so weird I felt so bad like it was something that I could have fixed. something that was a problem that I had the answer to but it just wouldn't come out of my brain. consciously  I know that's not true. but deep down I still wish that there was something that I could have done. to keep him from hurting mom and dad and the rest of the family like he did. i never saw someone breakdown as much as my mother did. but PROPNAME is better now I don't know if he's taking his med. but he. time's up

__label__label1 Honestly, right now that I have this assignment all I can think about is what to write about. I wonder and wonder what I'm thinking but all I can think about is that I want to get this done because if I don't I will eventually get behind and then I;ll never catch up and everyone will be able to go out and have fun while I sit at home and do my computer assignments for this class. I guess all and all that translates to me being scared of what I am and am not doing. I sit in my room a lot and think about all the assignments I need to do and all the things I have to do but I never quite get the innitiave to do them until it is the last minute. I am so scared that I am going to fail now that I am here because I don;'t quite think that I belong hwere. Everyone else seems so smart and like they belong here and I am the black sheep. It scares me that everyone seems to have all of these friends already and I don't I just miss my friends that I had in high school. It is different here, no one is the same and maybe they are and I have just changed. I wonder how long it will take for me to fit in like everyone else seems to. My roommate and I have been friends since like the second grade, so I didn't get to meet anyone new when I moved into the dorm. It scares me to even be in the dorm because I am more homesick than I ever would have imagined being. I miss my parents and my friends and my pets and my room. I only live 00 miles away but I worry that I will look pathetic if I go home all the time, but I so much want to pack m0y  stuff up every few days walk a mile and a half to my car on the side of the road and head back to PROPNAME. There is absolutely nothing special there, but I miss it so much. My parents say come home anytime you want but do they feel ashamed when I do as if they didn't raise me well enough to make it on my owm. I also feel bad because I don't have a jobn yet, I have never gone without a job, I've continuously had a job for the past two years and now my parents are paying my way and is that fair, they shoudln;'t ghave to I'm a bigt girl I should be paying for my own things, this isn't fair to them. I feel so dependent on them aNED ALL through high school I felt so dependent and now that I should even more, I don't at all. I don;t even know why I chose this school, I think it is becuase everyone thought that I couldn't and I wanted to prove them wrong but that syhouldn't of veen the reason. I am happy tht I am here now because I think it is a good school but I didn't have good reasons when I applied and I worry that will effect my future here. I feel lonely being here. My friends are at other schools in LOCNAME and I still have some in PROPNAME but I feel like I am here all by myself and no one sees me as good enough to be freinds with. I feel like everyone already has their groups and I just don't fit into them. Today is the best that I habe felt in a long time becausr my friend PROPNAME is coming by from ORGNAME ORGNAME's and her being here might make me feel like I have someone. I don't know why her being here would do that, but just maybe it might. Every time I sit outside I see people being picked up to go do things and I jsut sit outside by myself smoking my Marlboros wondering when I will have someone coming to pick me uyp,. Maybe that will mak e me look important but why do I care what these people think, even when they see me in the hall they don't know who the hell I am anyway, I think I want them to though. Maybe then I would feel as if I was a part of the university. Right now I feel like a blacksheep and I have never in my life felt like that. Is there a reason why these people look at me odd, why do they not make efforts to speak to me or why do I not make efforts to speak to them. I guess I have a fear of them not accepting me therefore I don't even make the effort to approach them. IS the chance of rejection worth the effort on my part. But then aGAIN maybe they want send me signs of rejection, maybe they will see that maybe I am a good person and then I would fit in, but what are the chances of that happening. (I feel so dumb writing this becuase I don't say what I feel ever. My mother thinks that I am like in the fact that instead of being honest and admitting how I feel, I create a front and never say what makes me happy, sad, angry, etc. Instead I act like I don't care either way  and go home or whereever noone is at and cry in private. If no one sees me cry then no one knows how to push my buttons and if you never let anyone in then you never get hurt. Only one of my really close friends knows that I do this, but that could lead to me only having one really good friend. But I don't think so becuae I love my friends and they love me no matter what so if they really knew who I was then they wouldn't care. It wouild probably be a relief to them becuase then they wuold know that I was human. Not that they think I'm, not but I don't show feelings so they wonder what I am really thinking, but if I tell people whta I really think then I open myself up way too much for dissappointment. I don;'t know what to do, I htink that is why I haven't gone home because if I am stuck here with all my feelings then eventually I will have to open up and let people in and if I run home every other day, I will have too much security and I will think that I can remain closed to new things forever. THis way I am forced to accept myself and that way I can find out if people accept me. 
__label__label1 Twenty minutes seems like a very long time to have to write about what I am thinking in my conscience. I just got a letter from my aunt. She was writing to see if I was ok and whether or not I like ORGNAME. So far I do like LOCNAME. I just wish that I had the social skills to make friends easier. I am not a very out-going person and it takes me long periods of time to become good friends with people. I am very picky about the type of people I hang out with. I especially dislike snobby people. I realize people are all equal and that under no circumstances should anyone believe they are better then someone else. Although sometimes I do feel I am smarter than other students here at UT. Everyone always tells me I have a huge amount of potential, but that I need to motivate myself to use my potential. Sometimes I feel very lonely. I am an only child and my parents divorced when I was five. I have never really had a real relationship. I want so bad to have someone in my life that will stand to hang out with me twenty-four hours a day. This wish makes me seem very needy and I hate to think that I am a needy person. For some reason I think being needy makes me weak. Oh, well, on to something else, this so far hasn't been very fun. I am not sure what I want to do with my future. I am undeclared in the college of natural sciences. Undeclared could be used to describe my entire life. I try, subconsciensly to avoid any huge decisions. I sometimes think that I want to be a psychiatrist. However, this is for selfish reasons. I believe that I am self-sufficient. I don't want to let someone else fix my problems. If I became a psychiatrist then I would be able to analyze myself and determine why I am screwed up. At the top of this assignment it said not to worry about spelling. I guess it's the perfectionist in me, but there is no way I could leave behind a trail of mispelled words. I realize though that there are some mispelled words in this paragraph though. I wonder if someone is actually going to read this. I keep having to look over my shoulder. I am worried that my roomate is going to read this and think I am some kind of weirdo. Is weirdo actually a word?  For some reason I don't think it is. Weirdo makes me think of Gonzo from the ORGNAME ORGNAME, also that blue guy from LOCNAME LOCNAME. I haven't watched those shows in years. It's funny what people think of sometimes. Actually time is slipping by pretty fast. Ummm. I can't think of anything to write. My schedule is so screwy. I have four classes on M, W, F, and then one on T,Th. It gives me plenty of time to work on homework or prepare for classes though. My mom is susposed to get on Instant Messenger tonight so we can chat. I miss her and my best friend a lot. My dad is an asshole. Can we curse on this assignment?  I was never able to before. College is so different, people actually treat us like adults. I want to get an apartment. I don't like living in the dorm. Not enough personal space. I also want a dog. My favorite breed of dog is the chow-chow. However everyone always tells me they are very protective of their owners and can become aggressive towards strangers. I want two so that they can keep each other company while I am at school. That is a dream though. I have to decide whether or not I want to get my car fixed or sell it. I am leaning towards getting it fixed because it is a good car, ORGNAME Stanza, and there is no way I can buy a new car. The only problem is that it is an '00. That is really old compared to all my friends cars. My best friend drives a '00 Tahoe. Lots of people call him spoiled, but I don't think so. Well time is up, I'm not sure I got the point of this exercise though! 
__label__label1 The jumbled mess in my head goes on and confusion takes over. Sorting out feeling from feeling and sensation from sensation leaves me with a fatigue which overwhelms me with each passing day. Not totally sure of where to go or what to do, I feel as if I wander aimlessly amongst all the people. things pop into my mind, and they are the importances of certain classes, such as the tests coming up, and all the studying I still need to do. I think more about this until it consumes me, and then outcomes that might not usually happen come into mind. I can't help thinking about this as I sit here, yet I feel I shouldn't think so much about it. The possibility of failure seeps into my mind, and I can see myself never forgiving me for such mistakes. My breathing gets heavy for fear of what failure's consequences may bring. Like anxiety, I fear of failure, until something else wanders into my mind. As failure subsides, and my body is back to normal, the apathetic view of things set in. I start to feel lazy, and I don't want to work. I feel as if I am walking on a fine line, and a step to the right means laziness (although at the time is very tempting), just as a step to the left means productivity. The forces keeping me on this line are 0)the fear of failure which keeps me from being a sloth-like animal, and 0)the feeling that I am not being productive when I truly am. I guess it's like growing, in a sense, for the second force, that is, because when I see myself each day, I don't notice the changes that happen when comparing one's younger self to himself, now. Keeping this in mind, I guess I have found another reason why not to be lazy, but it seems like I will have to have self-disipline, which in a way is like teasing one's self for as long as you have to wait for the results. Maybe I'm still being a child who doesn't want to wait for his reward. I just don't know how to change myself in that direction of being so diligent even when things are not so great. I will have to learn if I want to remove myself from this line of opposing forces, and however tempting it may be to stay on this line, I will have to find the discipline within me to do such things as study, be diligent, and stay current with the right thing to do. 
__label__label0 I am very famished right now. I just got back from the psychology class. My stomach is gnawing, and I feel the grinding emotions. I haven't been very energetic the whole day. I almost fell asleep in my calculus class today. This is terrible, because I have never really gotten that tired in high school before. It always just seemed to be the calculus class that I almost fall asleep in. I am very frustrated at school. It is not only that I am a freshman, and that I am still trying to adjust to college life, but it is also due to my classes. For example, I have a biology class, with an excellent professor. However, his teaching assistant is making me really upset, because he can't really speak english. He is Indian, and I am sure he must be very intelligent, but I cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. I understand him on that basis, because I am after all a foreign student, and 0 years of high school have really changed my speaking capabilities. But I guess the older one gets, the harder it is for them to learn and adapt to new things. Anyway, I was vexed too, because he would not explain the questions asked by himself, but he would ask the class to input their answers. I understand that he wants the class to participate as a whole, but he can't just rely on students' answers. After all, we are just as confused. Math class is almost the same, except my math teacher speaks better than him. But Math has always been a tough area of subject for me. I have a bad history of math, and therefore I think that class is prone to my exhaustion. My professor is explaining math thoroughly, and he is very helpful and good, but my dislike for math overcomes me. I know that it is mind over matter, and that if I try to psyched myself to like math, I could probably get to put my energy into it. Don't get me wrong. I have always been a good student. I was valedictorian of my high school, and my high school is one of the best in LOCNAME. However, there are always some flaws even to the perfect, because no one is infallible, and I tend to procrastinate. This in the end results in my fears now. I am getting so nervous every day, because I am behind in my reading of assignments, and I am   worried that some professors are going to spring out pop-quizzes on me. I  also noticed that I not only tire so easily now, but my attention span has also increased, and my thoughts wander so much to the insignificant matter. I can't seem to concentrate reading in my room, when all the food, bed, noises, and I guess everything seems to distract me. Also, I have never been in a relationship before, not even dating, and in college, I thought it is where one may start for me. I often find myself looking out for guys. Even if I do get into one, I am sure that I will not do anything to jeopardize my future. I really want to be a doctor, and I am right now very worried about medical school. I really want to enter ORGNAME, and I am rather mad that they deferred me during early decision, and didn't admit me during spring decision. I guess I am being irrational here, but I did harbor the hope that I could get in because of the deferral. But that stumbling block will not trip me, I will still continue to work hard in college, get out with a 0. 0 ORGNAME, and hopefully a high ORGNAME score, and hope that I can apply to ORGNAME and get into med school. That would be a very nice, ultimate dream that I would ever want to fulfill. I am very hungry right now, and I am having a major headache trying to think if I should double major in something, because it is not wise just to major in biology, and think that everything including medical school will be smooth for me. I think I will visit my advisor on Friday.     
__label__label0 I have just gotten home from a two and a half hour rehearsal for an orchestra that I never wanted to be in. I signed up for this orchestra only because I thought it was on optional group. but now I have been stuck in hour long rehearsals which make me very tired and make me get home late and then I have to do all this work and then I'm tired in the morning and am achy all day long. my left shoulder is killing me right now. it's from playing the violin. I think that I raise that shoulder and so then it hurts for long periods of time. I'm supposed to call jeff in 00 min. I haven't talked to him in over a week and I really miss talking to him. it's strange how I can go months without talking to him and then once I've talked to him, I get these urges to talk to him again. sometimes it seems as if he doesn't want to talk to me, but deep down I know he does. I don't know why I'm writing this in my psychology writing exercise, but it's what is in my head right now so that's what I'm writing. you've got mail is on the television right now. I like that movie, however I just saw it this morning, since every movie is on like twice in our dorm. I like taht. we get to see all these movies whenever we like. but actually it kinda distracts me from doing schoolwork. I really wish I could paint or make art. my roommate is on the floor painting a blue sky and it is beautiful. I really like modern art and she is all into it. our room is very nicely decorated since she is very artistic. I think it's strange how kinsolving put two freshmen, both from the houston area, and both fine arts majors together in a room. I kinda like it. it gives me an access to a ride home whenver she's oging. I've never done these stream of consioucness writings before. I kinda like it, but I'm not used to it. I feel like I'm making no sense what soever. I'm going out with this guy from my high school on friday night. it should be interesting, because we haven't talked all summer long and we used to be best friends. so it might be a little awkward. but I think it will be okay. I'm really tired of writing now and I think it's been 00 minutes. so now I get to stop writing and soon I will be able to call jeff. 
__label__label1 I have just arrived from home. I went home this weekend for labor day and spent time with my family, friends,and everybosy else. The time I spent thier was very rapid, it went by so fast. Sometimes I miss home sometimes I think if what is going on over there I mean it is not a really big town, but it is a part of me. Now that I am here I like it at first I was knid of lonely, but now I am feeling better. I really need to get on reading for tommorrow. Am I going to do good this semester? What is going to happen? I have the potential to do good and I know I aam and can. Oh well, I really miss mando, he is a really great guy that really confuses me and at this point in my life I do not need that. He is over there I am here I mean that is crazy, I have to stop myself. Our relationship is getting to out of hand, to serious. That is not always bad, but right now tha is all I think about him, us. Should I stop talking to him, let go eventhough it hurts, I mean what do I do? I mean I am sitting here talking to a computer and letting out all my feelings and I don't even know who is going o read this, this is so crazy. What if I stop talking to him and it hurts, what if it breaks ny heart that is crazy. WHAT IF!!!!!! Anything can happen oh well I have to stop thinling about it and just see wat happens in the next days, weeks , months. I have so much reading to do for tommorrow, the next day and so on. What is wrong with me I am so crazy, I think about crazy things. Life out of high school is so f\different, it is so weird. Right now I am typing in my friends computer since my computer doesn't work , taht is really pissing me off. I wan t my computer I hate using other peoples things, I really want my computer fixed. I am going to look into that tommorrow. There are so many different types of people in this school, differnt places, intersts and so on. It is a whole different world here, but I really like it I started wanting to go to SEU and now I am here it is a big difference. I like it though, different is good, I like that. I really miss mando, he has had a huge impact in my life, my mom does not like him ofcourse, but I do. I really don't know how he feels about me he really confuses me. He is always on my mind I have to stop because it is interfering with everything. I look forward to going ome because I want to see I'm and my family. Gosh, this is the worst feeling I have so many things on my mind that I just cannot talk about them it relly pisses me off. Life is so complicated, but we have to take it as it comes and just ry to avoid the bad things. 
__label__label0 PROPNAME happened today. i can't believe PROPNAME killed himself I'm fine but what about PROPNAME and PROPNAME What was going on in his head. I hope PROPNAME and PROPNAME can deal. Horriblr thing to happen. I hope PROPNAME stays in school. I worry about everyone too much Not enough about me. I'm glad I can be the strong one and be there for them. i wish we were all back at home. Right now home feels so far I would love to hug my mom. she is worried about me. her baby away at school. what am I doing at this school. i feel so lost. Is this where I meant to be  Ineed a reason to be here. I'm not supposed to be lonely. Will I ever fall in love I hate being in this room alone. I need someone here with me. why is life so confusing? What do my feelings mean everyone has it so together. Will I? I put too much meaning in everything. Poor Max What a wasted life. He needed someone to help him. I want to be there for matt but he needs time to grieve. I can't be intrusive. I need to stop trying to fix everthing. Its all planned out already. I hope I see PROPNAME tomorrow. He gives me something to look forward to. Hes such a nice guy. Is he interested in me? Tomorrow is a new day. Today has opened my eyes. Don't take life for granted. 
__label__label0 Free asscia-association. My friend and I have a game that we play on instant messenger with free association. it's fun. My nose is cold, this dorm is always cold except for that one time- where it was hot after I had walked in from already being hot in this hellish austin climate. I'm listening to john coltrane. my friend bought me this cd. it's really hard to not press backspace when I misspell a word. um. i like the music I'm listening to but it's kind of a bad recording. a girl down the haa, syd and I were taling about britney spears the pop singer tonight. I was concerned about how she's making pre-teen girls want to change thiere bodies since she got a boob job and since seh she's an pop idol- it's okay to get one or something. I was never happy with my size when I was little, but I just don't think that she should have gotten one. it's not that important. um,. 00 minutes>? I have all of 00 more to go. I'll stop at 0:00. I went to my first frat party last night. that was a trip and a half. there were several people from my high school and one girl from my ex-boy's college(baylor) and I don't like her much, becuase I don't know what kind of relationship they had. that boy. jesus christ. that bastard. well, it's okay I talktd to him f on the phone for a while today for the rfirst time in -well, since I got here. we erewere really close over the summer. he was smoking pot when I called. I called becuase last night after the party I came home an dwhen I checked my email, I recieved amn emial fronmm some guy named richard _will I print this out?- he has a n address similar rto my ex's an di've been sending emial to the wrong guy. so I emailed him back event though I didn't knowhim and explained to him what had happened. then I got a respncse today from him and I mailed m him again. I relly like my computer. I t upset someone , thoiugh. , I went out with a guy that I met becuase he built my computer, he told me I that he loved me after 0 weel and I (week) got scared. I hate most men now. but that's okay. hating boys is what made the frat party so fun last night. I danced with a boy for about a minute and then dropped him - just like that and walked back to my grlfriends, laughing. ewe walked home last night- right past some cops-we also made friends with the bouncer. he told us a joke to see if we;d been dringing. I thought he was great. well, I son't know what else to say. my fingers are cold my nose itches and my hair is in my face. syd said that someone's talking about you when your nose itches. I always though taht when your necklace was on wrong someone was thinkg og of yu. I have a stuffed animalk. she's the super adventure team mascot. esta eric and adnrew and me. we had so much fun. ruby was the mascot. jojos, photograh, high speed, gun. I meanyt fun, but it came out gun, I haven't been looking at the screen becuase I am not very good at typing like that. I'm starting at my fingers and io know when I mess up, still, but I'm not fixing it. I was a little at the beginning out of habit- ani di franco has a sog called out of habit. "you know, art is why I get up in the morning, but my defif\nition ends there, it soesn't seem fair that I;'m living for something I can't even tdefine,. and there you are right there in the mean time, wekll I don't want to play for you anymore. Show me what you can do. Tell me what are you here fo. I wasnt my own time I wasm my old friens, I want my f\old face, I wasnt my own mind. Fuck this time and place. I like that sone. it's a favorite, I only have 0 minutes left. I wanted to do this when I had full concentration adn preferably not a roommate bugging me. she went home for the weekwnd. she wasnted me to go with her. she talks in her slepep, and it 's really funny, but I try not to laugh becuase I'll wake her up. I'm worried about my friend breda, I miss her. I worry about PROPNAME and Esta too. I love thenm. I have on e more minute. Maybe I'll have a tic tac when this is all over. I need to go to the ORGNAME tomorrow for art history I need to sugn up for experinments, too. I'm not going to sign that health form, though. I don't know if I want to give access to my health records like that. I have nothing to hide, I'm just not comfortable with it. I have cramps now. an dmy time is up, so bye. 
__label__label0 Hello, well I'm writting my stream of consciuness at a friends room because the  ethernet at my room does not function as of yet. So here I am pondering as to what to say. It angers me that I have not been able to log online at my apapartment yet. i intead to call the ethernet people and ge the situtation rectified but as of yet I have not had ample enough time to properly do that. Well, school is pretty cool so far so I don;t have much to complain about, I just ate lunch and suprisingly the school cafeteria food isn't that bad, in fact it sort of is pretty good, they have nice burgers and I always pile on the tabasco like the bastard I am. Twenty minutes is quite a long time, I bet my response here would be more interresting if I was under the influence of some intoxicating something or other, not that I do that sort of thing, but who really cares right?  I seriously doubt anyone is reading this and if you are then I send out a hearty "hey hey hey". Well hey, anyways,b back to the subject at hand wich is nothing except for the monotomous and endless stream of infinity that flows through my veins like a vapor of the serpent that eats tiny little fleas that impend on the consciouness of the letter better red little ant eater. Oh hey, are you following my consciouness?  Or are you thinking that I have lost my mind in the impending fires of infinity that ingulf the ebb and tide of an ocean tht haas not yet come to grips wit hthe reality that condesends to the vast pits of a sub-world burried in the truths of a mad man who has lost all sense of truth,  pity, and denial, opting aptly for the tools osf self destruction and the endless orgasm of the inevitable ghost. So we can fully understand our prophets. who cares?  who cares about the subtle truths that we seek to uncover in I various means of apathetic lethargy?  perhaps we schould quote some famous scholar and then abolish our reason with the tip of a hat a cigar made from banana leaves?  Where have our morals gone today?  Where is the profanity in a language that adulates the adoration of adulturation and the abominal abortion of the spirit of the infite wisdom burried in the truths of an incoharant lunatic rambling at the sppeed of a jack rabbit copulating wit hthe pourpouse of my reasoning. Well I ponder if it's been twent ymintues yet, and I think that it indeed has so I must depart with a hearty hand shake and in the words of the infinite wisdom of the great and all mighty pooh bear, say ta-ta for now. take it easy and such. where is the party in the silent room?  Indeed if you know won't you please come and joing me. All is ripe for the tacking. So long for now. 
__label__label0 I'm kind of frustrated right now with PROPNAME. She just left to go to meeting and she just bothers me. It's like she's annoyed with me but she won't say anything. I hate it when people do that-it's like just tell me what's going on, don't just act nonchalant about it. It pisses me off. It's like she just kind of ignores me all the time. I thought it would be better when she came back this weekend, since we spent time apart, but it's not. Gosh I sound like I'm talking about my boyfriend or something. But nope, it's my roommate. I'm feeling kind of pissed off about a lot of things actually. I ate way too much yesterday which sucked. And I was doing really well about working out here, and now all of a sudden I'm getting lazy. I don't get it at all. I talked to Price last night which made me feel happy and sad at the same time. It usually does when I'm here at school. He always makes me homesick. It just sucks because I was home the entire summer and he just didn't take advantage of it. I tried, I really did, but he didn't really make the effort until like the day before I left. Figures. It's so hard because we both like each other, but there's nothing we can do about it. It is so stupid that we are not in the same grade. I just keep thinking that God does everything for a reason, and that I should just feel lucky He found a way to bring us together in the first place. I went to church for the second time since being at ORGNAME. It felt good, but sad too. Kind of like talking to Price. I don't know-I know everyone says over and over again that it's hard to find a church in college and that you just have to keep an open mind, etc, etc. But it's true and I keep comparing everything to MDUMC. I miss it so much, especially PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I miss everyone there. I wonder what it would be like to go home again next summer and do staff. I would probably be really bored, but I guess God will lead me where I'm meant to be. I just don't want to spend all summer in LOCNAME drinking my life away. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like drinking, but I just don't enjoy doing it all the time. I just really need to get involved with some Christian organizations here. I also need to find a bible study that I enjoy. I feel so lost if I don't have fellowship to keep me on track in my faith walk. I hate being so close to God in the summer and then straying so during the school year. That's just not how it should be. I have got to work on it. I especially need to do my part here, like praying and quiet times. It's like working out-no never mind, that's an awful comparison that I really don't want to make. I wonder and daydream way too much. I wonder about stupid girly stuff sometimes like who I'm going to marry and when. I wonder if I'm going to get a job. I wonder about why I'm such a moody person. Sometimes I feel really different from everyone else around me. Sometimes I wonder what I would be like if I went to ORGNAME. Would Cal and I still be inseperable? Would RT and I be good friends? I don't know, it's just weird. I wonder how it's going to be with Price when he goes to college. I wonder if he'll meet some girl and totally forget about me. I'd probably be so jealous if he ever found someone that he was closer to than me. But I shouldn't if he does-I should simply be incredibly happy for him. We just have a weird relationship. I wonder how PROPNAME's doing really. I mean, I know he acts the same, but he has to be going through a lot. I can't even imagine. Sometimes I want to ask him about it, but I don't know how to put it or what to say. I mean, I can't just randomly bring it up. I wish sometimes that we still talked like we did in high school. It was weird last night when PROPNAME and PROPNAME were talking about PROPNAME on the phone. I haven't thought about that boy in a long, long time. He still makes me mad. what a stupid thing he did. I still can't believe he threw away our friendship. we really clicked. we could talk about anything, and that just doesn't happen very often with two people. I mean, I obviously got over him romantically, but we could have been lifelong friends. Too bad for him I guess. I still wish sometime down the road that he would apologize, but I think a lot of people in life wait for apologies that they will never receive, or for people to come back into their lives that never will. It's foolish I know. I love my parents so much. I wish that I could treat them the way I want to deep inside. The way I know I will wish I did all of my life when they are gone. It's just ridiculous how much they do for me. 
__label__label0 I have no idea where to start on this thing, and I forgot to look at the clock 0:00, okay, I feel better now. This has got to be the longest version of LOCNAME LOCNAME ever, it takes them about 0 years to start singing. I need to go to the grocery store, need to get some milk and hot dogs. the essentials. Could probably just run to the 0-00, then I could get a slurpee. This chair is still uncomfortable, even with this cushion. Should just by a new one, but don't know where I'd put this one in this tiny room. Dorms suck. Living it up at the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Man, my typing skills have gone downhill, it's sad. I really should throw that bottle of water away, it's probably getting kind of funky. I'm going to fill this whole thing up in like 00 minutes, then what?  I want concert tickets, that was stupid waiting and then they sold out. I don't really want to pay a fortune, maybe 00. Doubt I could get them that cheap. I'm surprised PROPNAME hasn't charged over here yet, the morning's been really quiet. I've got so many things to do, none of which I probably will. got to write those thank you notes, if grandparents keep sending me cash I never will have to go to the bank, good deal. Oh, the screen moved up, maybe I won't fill the whole thing up. Ten minutes to go. My shoulder kind of hurts, must be sitting kind of funny. I wonder if I'll ever need those receipts, should probably just throw them away, see how much I can junk up my bullentin board, like I did my room. I could watch All My Children while I write my thank you notes, that sounds like a plan. I hope it's not a hayley and mateo day, don't think I could handle that. Got to love PROPNAME PROPNAME. this song brings back memories of 0th, no 0th grade. I think I liked 0th grade, don't really remember. Back at good old H. m. s. I should really go find PROPNAME and reminesce. Don't think that's spelled right, whatever. Haven't talk to PROPNAME in awhile, she's probably off trying to be the next PROPNAME foster. psycho. Maybe she'll be home for the balloon fest, doubt it. It's going to be so hot and miserable, at least I'm not dancing. Wonder who'll be taking my place, hope it's not chrissy. PROPNAME will probably be back in my spot. That would suck. My foot's asleep, three minutes to go. The computer better not crash now. I really should clean this room up, that's probably on the list of things to do. I wonder what song is next. Oh, that's the end, good my time is up. 0:00, yeah. 
__label__label1 Twenty minutes seems long, I wonder what the footbal game will be like. I miss my best friend. I'm glad to be going home next weekend. My own bed. It is lonely when no one is around me. WOnder what my roomate is doing? Why is my floor so quiet right now? I'm glad I don't want to be around anyone right now. I hope clubbing is fun tonight because I do not want to spend my entire year just sitting in Jester. WOnder if I'll transfer next year? I hope I get into the busines school, but at the same time if I don't I have an excuse to leave LOCNAME. I miss LOCNAME. Autum wil come soon, why are there no decent trees in LOCNAME? I hate the heat and the desert and the southern accents. I just want to be back in my comfortable bed in LOCNAME not in LOCNAME texas. I know I must be upset because I could barely eat at lunch. Why has no one called me today? I call people every day and leave messages, even my parents have more of a life right now. Oh, this is my favorite part of this song. I am gald I decided to put on PROPNAME PROPNAME while I did this. I wonder if my cats miss me? I bet they miss onnecticut too. I hope I meet some hot guys tonight, that are actually interested in me for once. I hope that my new found friends aren't too good at dancing because I suck and I don't want to look like this awkward fool with my friends dancing amazingly. I am praying that I don't end up grinding with some sketchy boy like last time with out even knowing it. I do not want to feel the penis's of random guys, hey just call me old fashioned but I like to know a guys name, maybe his major. Now I am getting too worried about the thing maybe I should stay at home. No, I will not do this to myself again, I can't this is completely ridiculous. Just because I don't know these people too well doesn't mean that I can hide from the world. how am I going to get know these people better if I don't go and do these things. ORGNAME was fun last night and I tought it wouldn't be. I am glad I got to sit on the end because everyone else in the middle seemed so squished. I think that I am loosing weight, I should be because I have been eationg a lot less since I have been here. No snacking for me!!! Plus I walk so mcuh. that's cool no freshman 00. But I could do with out the heat. That seems like a little too much for me. It never was that hot in LOCNAME. Okay, maybe, but I just miss it up there. All my friends, even though they are at college. I wish it was senior year again. Everything was so much less complicated then. Now I feel as though I will never have everything that I did there. I tried to appreciate it all when I had it, but I didn't appreciate it enough. I had so much and even though I still have the memories I miss it all so much. I know it won't be the same when I go back, but I miss the security that I felt there. I know that this is a learning and growth ex[erience but I do not want to have all this growth I happy with myself and what I was and don't want to change. Maybe if I am lucky I'll be able to graduate in three years. I already have sophomore standing thanks to my wonder ful teachers. I miss Mrs. PROPNAME and even Dr. PROPNAME. Why can't I just adjust and love everything? well I guess I just have to keep on doing what I am doing and that is that. all I know is that I will never forget what I left behind. 
__label__label1 camping was fun. got a little too drunk. I think I'm getting sick though. sore throat, headache, the usual routine. no worries. I hope I can be as happy as those people we camped with. even though they were kinda old they were still really cool. and they were partiers. it's wierd to think that peopole so different in age can totally relate to each other. I thought it was going to be a boring weekend but I think I actually learned a lot. I hope that when I'm that old I can still appreciate life as much as they do. they were just so gracious for everything they had even if it wasn't a kings life. and that one guy was the shit. I can't imagine being shot out of a cannon. he must have some great stories. I hope I can see dustin tonight. that would be bad ass. but I would really really like to see a sunset too. I'm definatley lacking in the sunset category. but I don't think the ones here will be nearly as good as el paso. damn I miss el paso. I miss the desert. I could go for laying in the bed of a pickup truck and watching the stars while listening to good music. maybe some live acoustic shit. bongos and guitars. that's the shit. I love gummy bears. the white ones are the best. but the other day we got a really weird one. it was big and gflat and tasted fujnny. but it was good. it was so good that we even split it between three people. so d'lane and I met this guy deniz. I don't know about him.     I have hella ant bites. they suck. all ants should die. a painful, painful death. I need to paint my toenails. that will be fun. I love my new fish clarence. he's so cool!  but he's a very deepo sleeper and he likes to play dead a lot just to mess with my mind. I hate fish!  but for some weird reason I really like that guy. but I miss my kitty a lot. that's a bummer. well I think it's been 00 minutes.

__label__label1 Why do I have this pimple? Why does it matter what people look like so much? I am sure that if we were all turned in inside out, and what was inside of us was on the outside, well first of all, we would look pretty damn disgusting, but if who we were was on the outside of our body, the world would be better. I am sure that there wouldn't be as many people wanting to show off their "body", because their new "body" would be who they were, and not everyone is happy with who they were. I went to my first college frat party last night, and it was one of the worst nights of my life. My best friend and I had this inclination to go there and do nothing but talk to people. He has a girlfriend, and I just didn't want to meet a girl there for other than friends purposes. It was HORRIBLE. It was crowded as heck, the music was too loud, so that in order for anyone to even understand you, you had to use a megaphone, and to be socially "accepted" you had to have a beer in  your hand. Now, one might think that would be an excuse, but I didn't see, but 00 out of at least 000+++++ without a beer. For some reason, I want to spell beer, bear, but don't let me please. Thanks. :o) Well, it was so dumb. My best friend and I walked around the whole time just walking, because in this one room, the music was so damn loud you had to use a megaphone to talk to people, and I'm not all about that. I am not the stud who has all the looks, but can't talk to people worth a damn. It doesn't matter though, if you are that stud, because the girl is too busy dreaming about your looks that she doesn't give a poop what you are saying. I am more a people person. I like to make people laugh. I don't do it on purpose, like go out of my way to make people laugh, but it's the way I am. I have this quirkiness (thanks PROPNAME) about me, but I love it. I don't want to be that stud that can't talk, because I am pretty happy with myself, until last night, when I had this feeling going into this party that girls in general had changed. My whole life, I have been nice, and I go by the saying "ORGNAME guys finish last". I had this feeling that it might all change in college, but the answer is "nope". I was at my friends house, and her roommates were all telling me that it had changed, and that girls now were looking for long lasting relationships, and they didn't want all that highschool bullshit that they had gone through before. Okay, I know this sounds superficial, but these weren't bad looking girls either. Two were pretty darn cute, and the third wasn't too bad at all, so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. I hate using the word ugly, and I hate judging people. I don't. I always hear my friends going up, and saying "PROPNAME, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly". Okay, first of all, I am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. Why? Why does it matter what he looks like? Why can't he be a  nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. How he treats her. What he does for the world. What is up with this world? I NEVER say that shit, because there is no reason for it. I hate saying "oh, he is ugly" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, I am not the best looking guy on campus, and I have no right in heck to say that. I HATE HATE when my friends say it. But, it's the world. College was supposed to be different. The time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. It hasn't quite been that, and granted, I have only been here for a couple of days, but I am scared. I am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. I mean, I go out and meet people, but I don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. We say when we leave "See  you around", but have you realized the size of this campus. It's freakin' amazing. There are 00,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. It was supposed to be different. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't have 00 eyes, and I have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. I get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. Maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. It's not that I am looking at all, because I am in love with Sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when I walk into a room, people stare. I promise you this. if who we were was what we looked like on the outside, I would get those stares. Thank you for your time. 
__label__label0 Simply amazed that someone has seen to it that I make it this far without more than what I have experienced that is comparable to adrop in the bucket considering that sometimes I could give a damn about what is best for me for the simple fact that I'm in it for the everything I can get only at times it's entirely too much to compute at once. boy, where has the trrain of thought gone to? Maybe it left to another place out of sight but never to be out of my mind becaause it seems to me that I'm already there. I suspect that everyone else is in their own way. that's why we are told everyone is "special" when we ae too young too know exactly what that means. I'm glad payed attention that day. Uh oh. here it comes again. jealousy rears it's ugly head signaling for the dogs who are  no less guilty of the crime than the one they persecute with their fingers crossed in vain hope wanting our hero to sacrifice his integrity for ideals of what was considered to be right by those who were so afraid of what it was they were dealing with that they confined themselves to an ignorant prejudice. well them fools can stay there and pray they never realize exactly what they're missing until it has already become a haunting unidentifineable thorn in their calloused side. Brains bruised with ignorance rather than blessed with memories of the world they restricted themselves from and feared to the day they wished they had not been such pussies. I cannot pity them, I have no time to devote thought to their rancid exsistence. I have my own to look after. I'm here know and those who would seek my friendship will have it. and those who seek my love will find it. and those who desire my trust and confidence shall not betray it or I shall strike down upon them with the fury of a thousand chained hatred's fire until their very soul. 
__label__label1 At this exact moment I am wondering how long this twenty minutes is going to last because I am going to falll asleep  soon and I  have a lot of things to do. I wish I could be doing this on my own computer, but the stupid thing wont work, I  think I am computer illiterate. I have had e-mail sitting  there since june and I can't get into it. It is killing me that I'm not able  to talk with all of my friends that went away for college. I shouldn't have waited to do this assignment until now because I need  to finish getting my stuff together to go back to ny dorm room. I am really glad that I was able to get away from her for a day, I always have the worst luck and got an incompatible roommate, but I would rather not have come home. The food is better but my  parents are constantly bothering me. I need to check my messages in my room,I bet there are going to be at least ten, and half of them are going to be from PROPNAME, my ex-boyfriend. Not going to waste my time on him anymore-- why do people cheat on each other, I woant  ever understand that. And what makes him think that just by sayng I Love You htat I am just going to forget everything. Forget hijm,  at  least I have met someone new that I can tlak to heis so sweet and all but I think I should call it off, nothing ever works for me  and I ned to concentrate more on my shcool work. I don't know what to do about guys. I need to meet some more girls to hang out  with, but the only ones I see are all snoby sorority girls  a nd that just isn't me at all. PROPNAME is such a sweet guy and all but should  I tell him htat I need to slow down and work on my shcool or should I just let things go and see what happens. I'm scared to just go with  the flow, I really like this guy a lot and the last time I felt this way I got hurt and  that pain is still here. PROPNAME PROPNAME calls I  get a happy feeling inside until I think of kyle and how he is here now and how PROPNAME messed up when he screwed me over. My mom is yelling at me again I wonder what I did now. Icould be nothing but it will still be my fault for some reason  I swear that if I ever heard my  parents compliment me or say that they were proud of my I would probably have a heart attack right then and there. I wish I wasnt such  a dissapointment  I have never done anything right and if I don't get a 0. 0 gpa they are going to lay it on me because if my sister can do it,  and play volley-ball at ut then I should be able to just sit there and study constently and maybe one day live up to her. My feelings for  PROPNAME and Kyle are so mumble-jumbled in my brain right now that it is starting to hurt from thinking about it all the time. Well what a  surprise my mom is coming to yell at me  as much as I am used to it the tears still come very easily. 
__label__label1 right now my mind says why the hell do I have to do this. I'm not up to doing this crap because I just woke up and I realized that I have to get this homework done before it is due in class. I have been missing home and all of my friends. especially the girl I love but she is being a bitch to me sometimes and I don't appreciate that. anyway I have realized that I have been slacking off in my classes and I have to get started on doing all of my homework because if I don't then my ass is going to be back in home racking leaves, and cutting grass. anyway, my roommate, which is my best friend is going to move out on me and I am going to be here all alone. I think that at he is stupid for what he did and I hope that all of it is falsed. he might have gotten his seventeen year old girlfriend pregnant and now she wants him to go home and be with her so he is going to  drop out of college to go back home and take care of her. i sure do hope that the bitch is lying and just wants for him to be close to her for no reason. but if she is lying and doing it on purpose,  then I will fuck the shit out of her for being a bitch. anyway enough of the vulgarity, this is  all that is bothering me and all that is running through my mind, I am also thinking about this girl named felicia that I met last night. she had just turned nineteen and she is one of the nicest girls that I have met down here. she has a wonderfull sense of humor, she doesn't like to leave anyone out and she has a beautifull smile. I don't think that she thinks much about me but I sure do  hope that one of these days she realizes what a great guy I am and she starts to recognize my existance on this earth. tonight is going to be a great night, we are going to go eat chinese food  at the china star, we are also going to go get drunk off our asses and party tonight. my friend is  not going to forget tonight since it will probably be his last night here so I we are going to party for him, the twenty minutes seem to be up so lates and peace out. 
__label__label1 I wonder if they sell show posters at that let's see, I have 0:00, I have until about 0:00 to write, no that's not right, yes, wait, yeah it is, anyway, I wish I could go back to new york I remember the LOCNAME LOCNAME I got to tell PROPNAME I ran into PROPNAME today and that she lives in LOCNAME, with the teletubby wrappingpaper on the door, I should tell PROPNAME too, I wonder how PROPNAME is and why hasn't she e-mailed me back, I wonder what PROPNAME's up to  right now. I got to get PROPNAME a birthday card and one for PROPNAME too. My Girl, aww that reminds me PROPNAME PROPNAME, I'm thirsty PROPNAME, I miss her I have so much work to do I want to take ballet really bad it makes me sad when I can't and I really wish I had my ponte shoes here aww daisy I wish she was here right now I wonder if she even misses me she doesn;t act like that, like she does when I get home, she could at least wag her tail or twitch an ear like Mama says awww hee hee oh I needa call LOCNAME and PROPNAME today and tell them hi I really want to see that album of pictures PROPNAME said uncle had and PROPNAME said PROPNAME goes hee hee I could be writing an e-mail for this long and not even notice it like when I write one for like I should tell Ms. PROPNAME about the press job, she'd be proud I still need to get my Savrola from churchill I wonder if they can mail it if I call and does she still work there?  I think so I think she does I wonder if she'd write back, I could just send it to churchill I hope suzanne at least found out something about josh even though veronica doesn't say much, I wish I had some degas posters to put on my wall but I wouldn't put them up there probably, I would probably just frame them cause I wouldn't want to ruin them like my dawson's creek poster, those copy max people I knew it'! I knew that'd be the poster they'd mess up with the laminating that reminds me I wonder what kind I don't remember exactly what kind of system they used in creative writing to do train of thought for a prompt that's write, I mean right! hee hee :OP  kathryn and emily, oh I have to write to her, or e-mail, that's quicker, anyway, it was some kind  of system where you type random letters or something I wonder how josh is doing I really hope suzanne found something out but I doubt she did becuase that's wierd how you can learn to type and eventually not even look ath the keys like gl said, awww I can't wait till 00nd street I wonder if gl and annette and daniel will come  back to do it and ay! those people are so loud!  quit screaming, it's like they've never been on their own before or something no control anyways maybe I'll see if anneliese can go with me to pick out a card for PROPNAME and one for robert and there was this one at LOCNAME and Noble that I wanted to get for christine, a pink cadillac, she 'll definitely like that, hee hee I can't wait till opening night that will be fun I wonder if she will be home tomorrow or tonight I hope so because I haven't written and I called the other day, but I hope she got the message, I wonder if josh got sarah's message or if he even got the card I hope so I want to watch my movies too but I have so much to catch up on. it's so cold in here I can't believe there's still like ten minutes to go, anyway, I can't wait till the a jet all the way why are you so nice to them if they annoy you so much why I can;t believe that lady sang somewhere   that's so wierd like david and mr. walker and suzanne's connected in some wierd circle to all of that it's wierd like it there really fate or, people would just say I'm relating all this stuff together because it's on my mind but things pop out at PROPNAME without her even asking, that's kind of  I wonder how long everyone else's is is it I guess it just depends how long you type snoopy awww I'm glad I brought those with me so they can sit in my dorm instead and my picture of daist mae I got to go to church this weekend too I can't wait till dc starts did I already say that, my arm' s starting to hurt Mama says it's too high like the ones at home it said don't worry about punctuation and stuff right, cause it's like train of thought I better go check at the end I wonder how many people actually type 00 min straight without stopping I'm trying anyway I guess I deserve a break but I don't want to have all this math hw in the week either I 'm so glad it's only a semester I miss PROPNAME I can't wait till she comes here it's wierd how all these twin subjects keep popping up I wonder if I should reread this cause time's almost up I can't wait to go card shopping it's fun I wonder if sara flores is back in town yet what was I saying oh I doubt people check over this I should prolly write to ms. hester sometime I was think ing about calling her but I don't know when she'd be there or have lessons or if I wonder how big little josh is now, not josh, but andrea's dog awww prolly pretty big by now I need to respond to ms martin's letter too but it sounded like she didn't expect me to respond for a while even though I prolly will and get sidetract I wonder what jessica's up to I have to get I'm working why don't they just say the problem instead of giving a number sarah thought that was funny when I said the computer talked I wonder if she ate with the cats today ha ha I should call her!  hee he :OP well time's up I guess I wonder if I should look over this prolly most people don't but  sarah says why do you check stuff so muchjust cause well time's up I guess I can stop writing now,

__label__label0 Wow, I can't believe I'm finally here. I've waited so long to get to the point that I am in my life right now, and now that I'm finallly here I feel like I really am not. I return to that same question that I've always grappled with. What is my purpose??  If I was religious in any sense then I might be compelled to believe in the "obvious. "  But I am not and therefore I must pretend to be purposeful and hope that in the end my lufe will be fulfilling. What did I throw away with PROPNAME?  Or did I throw it away?  Only time will tell I guess. I will say that I have never known such unconditional love as that which I had from him. I crave excitement though. A restless mind, I suppose. And a restless heart. One day I will meet my match I feel. Someone who will mirror me in my restlessness. we will feel out the world together and find happiness in adventure and passion. False idealism perhaps - or perhaps not. I burn with anger for what happened to Amber. Anger for whoever violated her and anger in myself for not seeing it coming. Let me correct myself - anger for actually seeing it coming and not doing anything about it. I've seen this coming to her for a year at least. And I never said anything to her. I learn from others, but I suppose others don't always learn from me. Thank God she's ok. perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. Well, a new start and new people await here. I feel like the world has handed me a gift and now it is my responsibility to embellish upon it. It's all there on a silver platter for me to grapple with, and I DO intend to grapple. I'm putting in my two weeks notice on August 0st. Counting down the days. My job has become such a headache. The money is good, the hours suck, and now the people suck. Why does money mean so much to me?  I feel like a green-eyed monster and I'm only 00 years old. I'm already thinking about investing. Thinking about doing a little research and putting my money where my mouth is. I plan on being in the six digits by the time 00 rolls around. What do you see when you look into people's eyes?  Eyes are the windows to the soul. I can read so much into a person by looking at their eyes while they talk. So what am I doing with blue contacts?  What am I trying to hide?  What do I want to become?  I think I would trust my warm brown eyes over my glacier-blue contacts any day. All in the fun I guess. A mystery to others and maybe even to myself. Casper is so peaceful. I wish I were a dog sometimes. To be caressed and loved all day and to give unconditional love without material or superficial worries must be pure emotional ectasy. Not a care in the world. My bed is calling.   
__label__label1 I really enjoy college life, I love being away from my parents but my boyfriend is still in dallas and I miss him so much that it hurts. Sometimes I feel as though I am alone and that this college world is so enormous it feels intimidating. psychology has been an interest for me since I was in middle school because when I was younger there were six guys who came up to me and my brother and asked us for our money and then pproceeded to hit my brother. this experience was very traumatizing to me and after that I went to my school counselor to talk to her about it all she helped me so much that I really got interested in what all the mind does and what one mind can do to another through therapy I went to my medical terminology class today and I was so tired because I stayed up until like 000 last night and now I am very tired and would like to just go to sleep, but I have another class college is completely different from high school I never believed people that said that until I got here ever since I have been here all I think about is my boyfriend and how I wish he was here and my studies I am really getting serious about school and I am excited about my years to come because I love the environment of everyone caring about school and their studies which is completely different than what people thought of in high school I love this environment I am in the computer lab right now doing this assignment  I hope I am doing this right even though it says there are no right or wrong answers to this writing assignment  this weekend jovan, my boyfriend's uncle is having his wedding party and I am going home for it at 000 I have to meet my brother at his fraternity house to get the car so I can get on the road to dallas I am excited about seeing everyone and everyhting but the drive by myself kinda makes me nervous just as long as I don't have to drive in the dark for a long time I will be okay cause it just kinda scares me when I am driving a long way in the dark by myself I did that survey thing for this class the pretesting last night on my friensd natalies computer and I thought it was pretty funny some of it the spider part actually made me scared even though I have never really had a fear of spiders before not like I was extremely scared of it but itr made me start thingking about spiders for a moment this day has been so busy it feels like anyway but then again I have had worse  I wonder if I will really fulfill my dreams of becoming a psychiatrist or what will happen in my future I know that me and jovan are going to get married in probably about 0 or 0 years - I hope anyway he is moving down here next year so we can be together I love him more than anything - everything about him my best friend is in utah right now at byu and I miss her so much I just read her email a few minuites ago and she is having a blast I wont get tosee her until christmas and it will only be for like 0 days because she has to go to LOCNAME and then she has a football game to go to she is in band there with my friend john I was in band in high school but there was no way I was going to be in band in college because I really didnt like it that much in high school my parents wanted me to stay in it me and my mom have been arguing a lot lately and it has really bothered me but I think and hope things are getting better since italked to her last night this weekend is going to be so busy tomorrow I am going to take jovans car tot he shop to get something done to it while he is at work and then I am going to go help his family get ready for the big day on saturday then saturday we are going to party all day and sunday I need to study all day I have studied all week but I need to review for monday cause I have a quiz in medical terminology over suffixes prefixes and roots my first college quiz!!  I'm not really that exciterd but I thought I made add some sort of sarchasm into this little essay that I am writting this is actually really interesting because I have never had an assignment like this and it has almost been twenty mionutes I wish I could type faster I get to see jovan in like 00 hours or somethign he gets off work late he works at a print shop where he does press stuff and he really likes it but is going to go to college soon I think I am done now thanks for listening 
__label__label0 I feel really crappy, today, I didn't get enough sleep last night. I think part of it is the LOCNAME loss on Saturday, especially the way they loss. Least the ORGNAME won last night. So far I haven't been very home sick. It might be because my roommate went to the same high school as I did. I have also been able to talk to my parents a lot because of instant chat. My mom wnts to get a web cam so she can actually see me. I think she has a hard time with me leaving, I'm the first child to leave home. The network here at LOCNAME is really cool. The connect rates are really fast. I had a crummy 00. 0 modem at home. My dad was going to get DSL, but we lived to far from the central office, that sucks. I'm really hungry now. I'm not hungry in the morning, but halfway through class, my stomach starts to hurt. It's probably because I'm used to sleeping late and not eating breakfast at all. 00 min to go. I'm not taking an English this year. That's good. I don't like to write papers very much. You might write a paper you feel is perfectly valid, but turns out to be wrong. Yet you put so much work into it. 0 min. Milk tastes pretty good. I'm used to 0% at home, but here, my roomate and I just buy the full vitamin D milk, yum. I hope there isn't a writing length, I'm having sensation block. 0 min. Time is almost up. Might take a nap, my next class isn't for another 0 hours. I don't have classes on Fridays which is so cool. 0 min. My alarm is about to go off. Set it for 00 min, so I wouldn't write too much. Time's up.    
__label__label0 Right now I am feelng a bit anxious to be done with this writing assignment. I don't think I have ever written for 00 minutes straight and I don't know if I can do it. I feel full because I ate a big lunch and I am looking forward to being done with all of my homework so I can sleep good tonight. I feel relaxed and stress free and it probably has to do with the fact that I have been sitting down in front of my computer for several hours now doing my own thing. That is, anything I want to and not things that I need to get done. I feel good after doing my own thing because I don't feel commited to anyone or anything. Okay, 0 minutes have passed. I can't do this. What am I going to type about?  I don't know how to describe the way I feel or my sensations. This assignment is a trick isn't it. It is meant to show that there is no way to express them and you just feel them internally. Oh boy, I am excited about the coming week because I just joined one of the choirs here at LOCNAME and I can't wait to practice. Music makes me feel good and I love to sing. Singing takes me away from all the daily stresses of this world and helps me appreciate the finer things in life. Also, there is a girl I met in the music school that I might get to see when I go to choir. She is nice and I wouldn't mind talking to her and getting to know her better. I am know thinging about PROPNAME. I don't know why but maybe because the girl at the music school has brunette hair just as PROPNAME has. I wish I would have told PROPNAME the way I felt about her along time ago. The choir director is really nice. She took time to audition me with on days notice and accepted me without many questions asked. I don't know anyone in choir and I hope I make friends in there pretty quick. In fact, I don't know many people here at LOCNAME yet. I feel lonely when I eay along or I don't have anything to do on weekends. It is different from back home when I could call one of my friends up and we would just hang out together. I am now thinking about my weight. I just lost a lot of weight and I want to make sure I keep it off. Eating here at Jester is tempting to get a lot of food because it is all you can eat. If I gain weight. I am going to feel down about myself again and that is absolutly what I don't wat. The pastor this morning was powerful and I liked ORGNAME all together. I will probably visit Grace Bible next week but I anticipate I will join EVFREE. They have great worship there and I like the pastor. Their first service will take awhile to get used to because it is so traditional, but I know I can handle it. I think that church would be a great place to grow as a PROPNAMEtian and meet other PROPNAMEians. I hear Chris' voice in the hall and I am thinking about him rollerblading and the cop telling him to take the rollerblades off and walk home. That's funny. Okay. i have 0 minutes left. I can do this. Wow. time flies when you are typing about your feelings. Now I am thinking about my roommate PROPNAME. I am wondering what he thinks about me. I don't know if he is mad at me for anything or if he likes me. I hope he likes me because I want to be able to get along with the person I am living with. I hope to be a witness to him this year and maybe he will accept Christ soon. That would be great and I want God to do that through me. I feel so sorry for PROPNAME right now. She has the problem with PROPNAME and she doesn't know what to do about it. I wish PROPNAME would grow up and realize that he needs to back off. He's been ticking me off lately. It makes me mad when I think about him and I'm mad now. Why does he act like a baby and whine to everyone?  Why can't he take things like a man. All he has been doing is whinning to PROPNAME and telling her how "he gets lonely eating by himself everyday" and trying to make PROPNAME feel sorry for him. AH!  Three more minutes!  I'm excited. I didn't think I could do this but it went by really fast. I am not looking forward to doing laundry this weekend. I have never done laundry in my entire life and I really don't know how to. What if I turn my clothes different colors?  What if I have to buy all new clothes because I messed up on the laundry?  Ooo. i'm worried about that. It is so cool that I found all these old ORGNAME games on the internet that I can play in my spare time. I haven't played some of those games in 00 years and they bring back good childhood memories. My email program just dinged so I have email which is very exciting. I can't wait to read it. It is now time for me to stop writing so this is it. I leave with a good feeling of anticipation. 
__label__label0 Mostly I'm reeling in amazement at how complicated looking a Vitamin B-00 molecule is. That goofy larry wall and his themed state of the onion adresses. heh. Doh. keep writing.

Wellk look at that, jam's brain goes blank, remembers the TV, backtracks to PROPNAME's debut in World Championship Wrestling and thinks how pathetic it was. PROPNAME PROPNAME is such an idiot. Oooh.

My use of (bleep) led to that rather long parenthetical outbusrt, which in turn made me think of his mighty authorliness Mr. PROPNAME, which in turn caused me to spontaneously recall several large words and what I did for an hour or three today. I do find it slightly amusing that in 0 out of my 0 classes today, a laptop and a puter-screen projector appeared. It's such a pity they all had crappy operating systems on them. Although the ORGNAME one was the worst. Windows. How sickening. I can't stand that feited piece of monkey (bleep).

Oooh. no pleasure in what you do. pity you sound like an idiot. The stinger coming out. joy. I like his entrance music. It's nifty. Sorta ominus and stuff. I liked sting better when he wore a trenchcoat, carried a baseball bat and descended from the ceiling. Pity those columbine dicks had to go and ruin the trenchcoat thing, and then the late, great, owen hart's descent into a ring post stopped the rafters stuff. I keep forgetting sting gets a title shot later this month. Damnit lex, get to the bloody point. I don't want to hear this crap. Irrefutable proof. Pfft. Scam artist. that's a good one. Did you think that up yourself?GET TO THE POINT YOU NADEATER. Jesus. you are so annoyng. PROPNAME rammed PROPNAME with the hummer. what the hell. oh that's so conclusive.

Oooh. scantily clad females. there goes my id again. I bet I could get ted to help me with my psych homework. maybe he knows some good stuff to do that research paper on, because there is no way in LOCNAME that I'm going to do that bloody experimentation stuff.

__label__label0 I hate this type of assignment, the kind of work that tries to force a thought into one's head. Thoughts should come naturally, and when the mind is prompted, then nothing comes to it. Well, as long as I'm supposed to be thinking, let's think about why I'm doing this. It's to get a good grade. Why do I do anything. I always seem to respond in a manner in which the answer seems acceptable to everyone else. Maybe I'm doing this to please everyone else: my instructor, my parents, myself. So why do I do everything else that I do?  Why do I devote so much time to working out and exercise?  Is it because I want to fool myself into living longer?  Is it to mold my body in such a way as to attract others and get their attentions. I always say that I just don't want to become weak, that when I find someone to protect, I want to be able to protect them. But if I am always desparately trying to find this person that would fill the current void in my life, why is it I push everyone away?  My friends, my peers, my elders?  I don't do what everyone says is "fun. "  I don't hang around others for long, I don't go to parties, and I rarely impart what I truly feel. It seems as if I've been hiding half my life, hiding from others and from myself. Inside, I scream to myself, "go out have fun meet new people you boring dolt!"  and in my mind I'm always prepared to do so, but when the moment of truth comes about, I never act out my true intentions, either being intimidated or discouraged. I remember when I went to that UT freshman orientation. My friend said when you get to the dance, just go up to people, introduce yourself, and ask for a dance. And he's a loser. But it worked for him, so I tried it myself. The first time, rejected. The second time, rejected. The third time, rejected, and even I know that 0 strikes is out. I get so sick of hearing excuses like oh I'm too tired or I don't feel like it. Yeah right. Then why the hell are you here at the dance?  Just give me a straight and vehement no and I'll be on my way, not even to think twice about the encounter. Now on strike three, I had another reason for retiring that night. That girl, the way she looked, the way she acted, it was deja vu. I went to another country with a girl like that, stood by her side, opened my heart to her, and offered it to her. She led me on, to believe that for once, I had an opportunity for love, that it was my time in the spotlight, and with the most beautiful girl I have ever been with. Visually stunning, patient but forceful, and gentle, someone to listen. I thought I finally found her, and felt as though I was riding above clouds. Then I just came down hard with the rain. I've never been the same afterwards, because everything was seen in a different light. This third girl at the dance, the rudeness didn't get to me, but the memories of heartbreak was just too much to handle. I asked PROPNAME out to the dance once, and she came. But we never danced. I asked and she ignored. Just like This time. Love. I'm too young to know its true meanings, and too inexperienced to have any justification in even corrolating it with the words I or me. I'm always looking for "love" for companionship without even really knowing what to look for. It can't just be the person that gives you that indescribable burning feeling within. Too many times has that happened. I say to myself, you know what love is. You loved PROPNAME, because all you ever did was argue, yet you could stand it. She broke your heart, lied to you, worked behind your back, carried you up and dropped you, and yet you still thought of her. Hell, you still think of her. You've been talking to her as a friend and the feeling has never left you. Isn't that enough to be love?  It's as close as I've gotten, I'm sure, but what about prom. To have danced with someone I've never known before, to talk, and to, after so long, have fun. When I held her in my arms, and her hair brushed my face as the slow songs played through, what was that feeling. Was it a feeling of completeness, of safety that as long as with her that nothing can go wrong?  What was that?  I go through sleepless nights thinking of PROPNAME sometimes, someone who I never gave a second thought to until that moment I told her goodbye. The moment in which the swelling in my throat caught even me by surprise. But am I looking for love or just someone. I don't want to end up like my uncle, having married a woman only because she threatened to commit suicide. Is he happy?  Am I happy now?  no, I'm not. 
__label__label0 well, write now I guess there are a lot of things going through my head, but it's hard for me to put them into words I guess. well I had fun last nite. i went to a party witha bunvh of friends. a lot of people were drinking, but iwas one of the few that wasn't drinking. it seemed like everyonw who was drinking had fun, but I had fun, even though I didnt drink. i had fun just dancing an d meeting people. i met a lot of guys, which wus good. since I usually am kinda shy bout meeting peopple. anywyas. i'm really tired right now, because we only went to sleep around 0, even though we came home around 000, and I had to get up at 00 because a friend from out of town styed over, so I had to help them pack and get ready to leave and stuff. gosh, I lkie so many guys right now, but I think that my other friends like the sme guys that I like, or at least they think he's cute too, but I don't know what to do aobut it. oh well, I guess I'll jus have to figure somthing out. man, I have a lot of homework to do today. actually I need ot catch up on my reading. i have a lot of reading to do in this class, then I have chem homework and calculus homework. i'm so lost in my chem class. well, not lost, but I wish I knew someone else in that class, so I could at leasst have someone to do homework with or jus to call if I had any questions, buti  guess I should just start meeting people in there, or someting, because I really need to find a study buddy in there. I think that's my only class that I don't know anyone in. i have friends in my language class, and in my calculus class and in my psych class. i just don't kno anyone in my chem class. but hopefully that will change soon. oh today either my roomate's dad or my dad called today, but this guy that was in our room picked up the phone, and our partents are really strict about guys, so I hope I don't get in trouble. the guy who picked up the phone covered it up pretty well, but then we expected our parntets to call again, but no one ever called, so I kinda got worried, that they would think that we have guys in our room. oh well, I think I may be getting worried over nothinh. because they probably wont even say anyting, or even know. oh well. oh, I have a minute left in my writing assigment, so I guess that's it

Oh well, I have no idea what to get PROPNAME for her birthday. Man I'm really having a hard time typing today. I wonder who's on im. I hope PROPNAME is I can't wait to see him on Saturday, and I really can't wait for the Mexican food. I need to spend time with my mom and dad and go shopping so I have clothes to wear down here. I don't want to go on that retreat. This sucks. Okay well I have another 00 minutes and my head is so jumbled up. I bet they think I'm a moron. My back hurts and I really need a nap. I don't want to write my English paper! I need to find a job here so I can have some spending money. I can't believe my math book cast me $00 that really put a damper on the day. I can't type for the life of me today. I wonder why they put a sticker of a bee on this computer. That's so random. I want to check my hotmail I wonder if anyone exciting wrote me. I haven't heard from my mom I wonder if everything's okay. I really need a nap. This whole go out every night and wake up at 0 thing is killing me. Oh crap I have to do my math homework. I wonder if it will matter if I go tomorrow. I'm going to be so exhausted. I should go grocery shopping so I can have some snack to munch on. The food here really isn't that bad. I should work out again today because I only worked out for 00 minutes and ate a huge lunch, I can't gain that freshman 00. I hope someone calls me I'm bored. That's neat that this computer capitalizes your Is for you. Only 00 more minutes. I hope Cat can get her cd burner working I really want that song it was so sweet. Man am I glad we don't have mandatory study hours, talk about adding to my stress. My eyes keep closing. I wonder if I'll see PROPNAME tonight. I'm stressing out about TX OU weekend. I want to be able to see my family and PROPNAME. I can't believe its $000 to make a cooler what do they think this is homecoming? I'm glad my face cleared up last time I go get my eyebrows waxed. I wish I were going home tomorrow. I don't want to go on this retreat. I wonder when we're getting our tshirts in, hopefully soon. Man my wrists hurt. I really need to get one of those pad things. I wonder how I'm supposed to paste this into that other site??? Yes, only two more minutes left. Wow that went by pretty fast. I can't believe how bad I'm typing today. I wonder when I can get my student ID back. I hope we actually get tickets. TIMES UP! 
__label__label0 Life as a college student is not quite like how I had expected. When I was a senior in high school, I thought I was going to be a studious student having a lot fun. But two weeks into college and I'm already slacking off. Most freshman who start off college don't really know what's going on, but I guess you can say that I had an early start. This was because my older sister, PROPNAME, also attends UT. With this factor, I quickly started to hang out with my sisters friends and began slacking off. So what I am saying is that, if I didn't have someone that knew what was up, than I would probably be having an easier time staying on track. Maybe its just me, but that is how I feel. But I am having a lot of fun, I guess you can say. I met a few people from orientation. They are the people that I am usually with. But I am having a hard time making friends in my classes. It might be because I'm always late to class and I never get a chance to settle down before class starts, probably. Well, I'm hoping to make some really good friends here. Isn't there a saying that a person makes most of their "life long" friends in college? I don't know. I don't even know why I am talking about my personal life for a homework assignment. I don't know if I am even doing it correctly. I guess that I will find out when I get my grade for it. Its been fourteen minutes and I am already running out of things to say. Okay, I'm going to return to what I was talking about in the beginning, SCHOOL life. I really feel that I need to get myself prioritized. I need to catch up with all my work and get ready for my up coming tests. I really don't know what else to write and I think this is about 00 minutes, so that it. 
__label__label1 As I sit here at my desk typing, all I can think about is how hot I am and how come our room is so unbelievably hot. I am under a lot of stress right now because I have so many pages to read and it takes me so long to read them since I have trouble focusing on them. By body is starting to sweat, maybe I should tell my RA to turn down the AC. I am really stressing over having to read biology, because, no matter how much I read it, I just can't comprehend what the book is saying. I'm sure I will struggle in biology this year. At first, I couldn't understand why you are making us do this, but now that I am doing this I understand the purpose behind it. This is really helping me to gather my thoughts and it is actually nice to express your feelings. My stomach feels extremely full because I just came from the Dobie cafeteria. I really wish I hadn't eaten so much junk food, I need to eat healthier. I am really regretting eating that ice cream, I have got to stop doing that. I also need to work out more. It all of a sudden just occurred to me that the reason I am so hot is because I am sunburned. When you're sunburned does your body just start letting of hot air or something? It is obviously clear that I am unfamiliar with the way my body works. I am dreading class tomorrow because I am so behind on my reading. I probably should be doing reading instead of doing this. Its funny how you find yourself doing anything just for the sake of avoiding the things you don't want to do. I only have to write for a few more minutes. I wonder what my test is going to be like in biology. If I take great notes and read, even if I don't comprehend it very well, will I still be able to do well on the tests? My elbow has just started throbbing because I scraped it water skiing earlier today. I really wish I wouldn't have fallen because it starts throbbing every time I extend my elbow. Oh great! Time's up. Talk to you later. PROPNAME

__label__label1 Today was very interesting. So much to do, though, with so little time. Study, work, and just living has become harder than expected. I miss the comfort zone I enjoyed while living at home. Oh, home, what a distant thought that now seems to be. I miss my parents, but I don't really miss my sisters. Yes, I miss my Mom's cooking. More importantly, however, I miss her reassurance and soothing smile every day. The daily smile is a luxury I no longer enjoy. My roommate hardly every smiles and when he does it's far from comforting. I guess a big part of me is homesick. This is such a large school with so many people, I feel overwhelmed. It is especially hard living off campus and not having the ability to be in an environment where you meet new people on a daily basis. Here at the apartment, everyone keeps to themselves. They've already made friends with people during the freshman year or live with their best friends. I, however, am not that lucky. I don't really know too many people and I didn't even know my roommate before I moved here. But, I have this thought that some beautiful, charming young lady will soon save me from this pit of despair. I think I'm at a point in my life where love needs to prosper. I've never been one for steady, or healthy, relationships but the loneliness I'm currently enduring makes a girlfriend seem very tempting. Love is, after all, what makes the world go around or is it? I've been so independent and so bottled up for so long, I don't know whether this cold heart can be warmed up for love and I surely don't want to break anyone's heart. I've done enough of that and learned my lesson a long time ago. There's just so much beauty in this world. I find myself drifting off almost hourly with the vision of some really hot girl. I lived in a town that might have had ten goodlooking girls, so you can imagine how surprised I've been walking the LOCNAME campus. Nothing could have possibly prepared me for the beauty littered around the campus and PROPNAME as well. There are so many girls and so few guys; it hardly seems fair. But I'm in no way complaining. It's like I'm the guy in American Beauty whose heart aches because it sees so much beauty around it. That's me in a nutshell. I see all these gorgeous girls walking around and I freeze. I don't know what to do because I've never been in a situation quite like this. Tomorrow is a new day and the future is bright. I find myself waiting for some girl to fall helplessly into my lap, but I need to wake up and face reality. If I want to find a great girl I need to initiate conversation and go from there. Wish me luck! 
__label__label0 Right now I am wondering how can I fit into college. I am wondering what is it that makes people think different than other people. Why is it that some people can do their homework right when they get it and other people procrastinate until the very last minute. Now my mind is totally blank. I am wondering why I cannot connect my thoughts to reach a conclusion. I am I going to be judged by how I write this. Does this accurately reflect my intelligence level. Again I am stopped by the nothingness that I am thinking. Its as if at one moment I am this intelligent individual and the next I am this ignorant fool that cannot manage to continuously write for twenty minutes. As I sit in my dorm writing this I am wondering whether or not I could be doing something else more fun. It is quite lonely in this room. For the most part I think what would solve a lot of my problems is a girlfriend. Someone to talk to that will fill this uncertainty of who I am. For the most part I have never been in love with a girl. What I want is exactly the opposite. I am ready for a relationship. Now instead of going on about this I am reflecting on what I just said. I am thinking is there something wrong with me because all the things seem so negative. But there are also very good things also. I think about how lucky I am to get such a great education from this university. I realize that not many people have this chance. I hope to really discover who I am in the next four years. I think that maybe the reason I have been writing all these negative things is because I am sick. I have a really bad cold and maybe it is effecting the way I think. Ok on to a different topic. I was just watching the road rules on ORGNAME and they were talking about how your childhood effects you later in life. I think this is the perfect case with me. In my family we never really showed any emotions. Not once have I ever told my mom that I love her. Maybe that is the reason it is so hard for me to get into a good relationship. I feel that my relationship with my parents is exactly like my relationship with anybody else that I have been close to. I don't really open my self up to anybody. All my emotions are behind a wall of shyness. My mom always said that I was shy. Maybe she negatively reinforced why I am so shy. But enough about that. I was just thinking about an amazing experience that I had with my dad last week. I was in my parent's room playing guitar. My dad comes in and starts playing along with me. My dad and I don't really do many things together so this was one of the most emotional experiences in my life. I was happier than ever before. My dad took the time to show me some new tricks on the guitar as I played along with him. It was such an amazing experience. Well I think that I have run out of time. 
__label__label1 You know I always wonder if I'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. I had opportunities to go to other universities but I chose to stay close to home. My parents always want it there way! They basically chose my major for me and when I wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. I want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and I know I'm going to stress over it, why should I bother to listen and I went with what I felt was best for me and I made the change. I always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. I see people trying so hard to make that A in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. One thing which confuses me is how girls think. They're like in their own world sometimes. You try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest IDIOT! I wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. They should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. Why do the ORGNAME suck so bad this year? They had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. They were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. They're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the ORGNAME. I mean if you had PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? The rockets need to do better next year also. I can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. They could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. If they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. I don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. It would be so much easier to study the material but NO, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. One thing I really love in the ORGNAME are the girls. They are so damn hot! Only if I could have one of them would I show them what kind of man I really am! Its ok, one day, I will find the right one. 
__label__label1 Well hello there, I just decided to start my writing assignment. I'm bored since my roommate, PROPNAME, for class so I decided to do this assignment today. I hope it isn't boring. It seems like an easy assignment, and since I'm not the best writer I'm grateful. I'm not the best typist either. It's a lot different typing something to hand in compared to typing to your friends online. My nose hurts and I'm tired. My throat tastes bad too. Hmmm what else. This is kind of a weird assignment. I have too many thoughts to write them all down, and I can't type fast enough. I'm struggling here as it is. For every thought I write down, a couple more are being wasted because of my bad typing skills. I keep having to go back and fix all of my typos. I have to call my friend today. I'll do it after I'm done with this. I saw a funny download about some coffee bean that was like the matrix. I liked it a lot, but I can't find the site where he got it, so I guess I have to call him. Also I didn't call him back last night either. I'm using the idea where you type it in notepad first then you paste it to the web, but I'm not sure if it's coming out the right way. I don't want to do this again, so I hope it works. I have to go turn down the air cause it's freezing in here, I can barely feel my fingers. There, it feels better already. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing now too. He went out with me last night. I don't have anymore classes today, and I want to do something cool. I do have to do laundry. I'm not sure if that is how you spell it though. The bag is getting big and smelly. I have to clean before my old girlfriend visits. She is very nice and beautiful. I'm mad because we broke up. Long distance relationships don't work, but we still liked each other a lot. So far I haven't seen any girls here that I want to go out with. I'm not sure if it's because I really like PROPNAME still or because my standards are a lot higher now. This is kind of fun just telling you everything, I'm doing my best now not to remember something really embarrassing that I would have to type to you. I think this is what a diary or journal would be like if I decided to keep one. I always wanted to do that, but I don't have the time. In second grade our class had to do one and draw pictures of our day too. I liked doing it and I tried to keep doing it but it just wasn't the same. I just lost the motivation to do it. It's always fun to read my old second grade one though. I was such a dork back then though. Not that I'm Mr. PROPNAME now though. It sucks here because at high school I knew everyone and had lots of friends. Now I still have some of my friends but it will take sometime before I know what's happening on the weekends. I still really want to meet a girl here, but I just haven't seen any that I really like. I just don't want to go up to random girls and ask for their number either. Personally I think I'm selling our if I do that. I'm not sure why but I feel stupid, like I'm trying to be somebody that I'm not. I just glanced at the clock and I have about a minute left so I'm going to stop now. I'm pretty impressed with my work here. I hope you like it, if you read it. 
__label__label1 For the past couple of weeks, I have been wondering about one question: Why am I here? As I go from class to class I look around at all the other students just like me standing around like they are waiting for something. What are they waiting for? Should I be waiting for something? A lot of changes have happened to me in the past 0 weeks. As these changes take place, I wonder, "I guess this is what everyone is supposed to do. Everyone gets caught up in doing what is expected from everyone else. If I were to ask someone as I walk by, "Why are you here at LOCNAME?" an overwhelming majority would probably reply by saying, "I don't know" or "That's a good question. " So with that said, I ask myself, "Why am I here?" I guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. If that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? PROPNAME PROPNAME is a prime example. He is not your everyday college dropout. He is making more money than probably 00 percent of college graduates. So is college a way of evening everyone out? Someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the American Dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the American Dream, but got it spoiled by being "brainwashed" in college. So what exactly does "brainwashed" mean? Everywhere I have been in college, there are professors talking about, "When you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. " NONSENSE. I don't want to work for someone. Nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok  paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn. I don't want to have to "use" my degree when I "get a job. " I want to hire other people to use their degree. On second thought, I'm glad professors tell college students to find a job with a big company when they graduate. That big company is going to be me. 
__label__label0 I had to wait until today to do this assignment because every time I wanted to do it or remembered to do it, my boyfriend PROPNAME was in the room. I didn't feel like I could do a true stream of consciousness assignment if I knew that he was going to look over my shoulder at any second. I guess I knew that my mind was on other things besides him at the time; stuff that I didn't want him to know about. He would kill me. Not in the literal sense of course but in any case, he would be destroyed. If I told him what I was thinking it would be the end. I don't want it to be the end. I'm not saying I don't want it to (I've got mail, and I really want to check it, but I'm going to keep typing) go on forever, but I love him enormously and if I told him that while he was gone for an evening I slept in another guy's bed and we ended up fooling around. that would obviously not be exactly great for my relationship with PROPNAME. I've always been big on honesty, but why can't I bring myself to tell him the truth about what happened between PROPNAME and I? Maybe because he'd ask why and I'd say that I'm not even really sure why. That's a big problem with our conversations. If he asks me why or what's wrong (he says "what?" a LOT) I can't ever give him a straight answer because if there is something wrong then I usually can't pinpoint it enough to describe it and if I attempt to describe it, then it usually comes out sounding wrong and then he'll bring it up later because he's like an elephant. he never forgets. So I'm still trying to figure out why? Maybe I needed something exciting. I've known PROPNAME for years and we've been dating for over 0 months. I was never really physically attracted to him, but only later I was because I loved him. The first time I met PROPNAME I almost stopped in my tracks. I don't know why. maybe it was because the first time I saw him was when I walked into a friend of a friend's apartment (he's my friend's friend's roommate) he had his shirt off and was working on his laptop. After that night I couldn't stop thinking about him and I heard (dang it, why didn't I put an away message for my instant messenger. That friend of mine that I was just talking about IMed me but I told her I had 00 minutes left so I'll talk to her later. probably about this assignment and because we've been discussing this PROPNAME issue) through the grapevine that he was attracted to me too. The next time I went over there I didn't really talk to him much. but the third time I was sitting on a couch watching movies with them and he sat next to me and we could tell that the chemistry was definitely there. After that we started emailing each (okay taking the towel off of my head. or maybe not, my hair's not quite dry yet. I'll just unwrap it) other. Then the night two weeks ago that PROPNAME went to a concert, I went to PROPNAME's apartment with my friend and we all hung out. Nothing too spectacular. I didn't intend on staying over but I developed a paralyzing headache and by the end of the night I was so sick that I couldn't move, much less drive. The guys offered to let me stay at the apartment so I wouldn't have to drive home and the rest is history. I felt so guilty lying in bed with him though. He had asked me if he could get in bed with me and I said yes. I said yes. I didn't move away when he put his arm around me or when he started rubbing my back. I didn't look at him when he started pulling me closer to him but I didn't pull away either. I was very still when he kissed my forehead, but I didn't tell him to stop there. Why didn't I? Because I wanted it. But I have a loyal, devoted, loving, honest, wonderful boyfriend already. Why did I want this, or think I needed it? It was thrilling. Even though PROPNAME was a bad kisser. It was like kissing a large mouth bass. Eventually I gave in and snuggled next to him with our bodies nicely intertwined. It wasn't really sexual. For the most part. This is making me sound horrible. I probably am horrible. Yeah, I am. This was cheating. And by not telling him and by still communicating with PROPNAME via phone now and still email, I continue to be deceptive. PROPNAME doesn't even want an attachment because he travels a lot for his job and may even be moving to LOCNAME at the end of the year. And I don't love him. I don't really know him. I've hardly been around him except for three or four times. We've had two meaningful conversations. The whole concept of a relationship with him is silly. Yet I haven't been able to stop thinking about him since I met him and wondering about him, etc, etc. I just had to fix my towels because they were falling off of me (just got out of the shower before I started this). My palms are kind of damp, not good for a laptop probably. Okay, it's been more than 00 minutes so I'll stop now. I wonder why I wrote a confession of sorts. And I wonder if anyone will actually stop to read this. I'd better not save this, just in case PROPNAME finds it. I'm terrible. 
__label__label0 Well I type kind of slow so I might not get as much in this box as everyone else. Anyway, right now I'm thinking that I have way to many classes and am worried that I might not be able to handle all of them in the same semester. I would have been ok but now I have an SI section for each class and it has filled all my free spaces. On top of that I still have to come back here and study for my lectures every night. I don't have very much free time to do other things. I'm not getting the time I hoped to have when I came to have a good time while I got an education. I don't have any free time to join any organizations or even go out and have a good time. I'm a long way from home so I don't get to see any of my friends or my family very often but I'm trying to make the best of things. I think that I will eventually be ok when I get use to this drastic change in my life. I just kind of wish that I didn't have to start over at this point in my life because I liked the way everything was going for the past few years. Well my twenty minutes are up so I guess that's it. 
__label__label1 Is PROPNAME still on the phone? At 0:00 I can finish this and go to the grocery store. It's on. I wish I could have napster on Ethernet. I am really hungry. I wish I could have worked out more today. I should write what I'm talking about. I wish I could type with the right fingers. Why didn't I learn to do that? It was an important step I missed. I think the grocery store is on red river. I wish the door were shut. I wish somebody had emailed me today. Hopefully zac can help me with calculus. I can't remember anything. The teacher didn't even go over it with us. I'm really nervous about the quiz. Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes. Wow this really sucks. I have so much to do. It seems like I do nothing during the day. Maybe I should have stayed at the dance thing. Now I'm getting in the flow of typing. This split keyboard sucks for pecking. I wish I knew what to do about track. The phone is ringing. I miss my sister. I am glad I went to the grocery store last night. I hope dad doesn't get mad about the money I'm spending. I can kind of hear Saturday night live. I don't know how PROPNAME concentrates in front of the TV. I had an itch in my nose. I can't wait until after my quiz. The hamburgers will be good at the KA house. I hope I have time to work out today. I think I will never be the size I want to be. Why do I have a rash on my ass? Its good I took a shower last night. I like my tri delt shirt. It seems like the time is passing very slowly. Only seven more minutes. Should I take a nap after this or study math or eat lunch? Ill ask PROPNAME. Maybe she'll eat with me. I like the cafeteria food. I wish everybody treated the help better. Word perfect sucks. I hate the little green and red squigglies. There are worse things I could do. Somebody's knocking at the door. It's probably PROPNAME. No it's PROPNAME. Is she talking to PROPNAME? Is PROPNAME going to be hungry? Man I hate those squiggly lines! I wonder if I should call the ticket office. I wonder if I'll need to study hard for this class. So far I've only done the pretesting and the writing. It's not even sunny still! That's awesome. I hate the heat. I can't wait until its fall. I love wearing jeans and sweat pants. I can run outside. Maybe then I'll get skinny. PROPNAME PROPNAME has a good voice? Where is she? PROPNAME PROPNAME sucks. She's ugly too. Her boyfriend is gay. Their relationship seems fake. My relationship is good. PROPNAME is great. I'm glad he's doing a frat. I hope they don't be hard on him. That is so gay that they do that to guys. I don't get it. Only two more minutes. It doesn't seem like I've written all that much. How are they going to know anyway? I doubt they'll even read that much of it. Bita talks a lot. She always has. That reminds me of Miss A. She never calls me. Why do I have to call everyone? Nobody ever calls me. PROPNAME emails a lot. I should e mail everyone. I'm much too busy for that. I need to call Dad. I want him to call me right now. At least that guy fixed the Internet. I need to learn to type. Okay I think I can stop now. I still feel like I should write more. Am I a perfectionist? I wonder if we'll learn that in psychology. 
__label__label1 This is my writing I always feel like everything should have a title. Somebody told me I was anal last night. I don't think so though. I've always thought myself to be rather easygoing. Church always made us be nice to people. That's another thing, people always tell me that I'm "like the nicest person I've ever met!". I don't see it. I may be easygoing but I do not consider myself nice. I think I'm just not mean so people think I'm nice. I'm not. You should see how I treat the men in my life. The poor boys don't have a clue. PROPNAME hopefully will never find out because I actually do love him a lot but I just can't seem to settle down for anything. That's got to be some kind of mental deficiency don't you think. Oh well, around this campus I think I am one of the only sane people around here. I'm saying that like I think I'm sane. I don't think I am. I like PROPNAME a lot too. He's so strong and "Mr. Cool" like. I'm always attracted to the strong cute ones. I guess it's some kind of complex about my tiny stature that I always go after big men. I can't believe PROPNAME got up to almost 000 pounds this summer. He is really making me mad though because he is not helping my constant state of confusion that I have been dealing with lately. I hate typing. I don't have anything to say anymore. I wish I had a twinkie and a juice box. I do need to go to the grocery store. Eckerds is just up the street though so I'll go up there if I can ever get caught up on all my work. I am going to try to make it to the ORGNAME party tonight. I think everybody's going to be there. I hope PROPNAME is there. He's such a cutie and he likes me a whole lot. He gave me these two massive hickies on the sides of my neck. They look really bad and they kind of hurt too. Oh well, at least I've found somebody that I like. I wish PROPNAME was here so that I could take my mind off of all these cute men. My nursing class is cool. Are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. Well, I don't think you want to get inside my mind. There's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. I guess everybody thinks like this though. I can't call myself different because sometimes I know that I am different. I don't think like everybody else I know. I think I'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think I am. Okay, I have been typing for 00 minutes now. I told you that I don't have anything to say. It's not like I don't write in my journal every night. I know how my mind works and I don't particularly like it. I happen to think I'm a little nuts, but who isn't. This isn't all about me though. I'm not the teacher so I guess I just have to sit here and type until your hearts content. That's what I'm here for. My mom tries to make people happy too much. She had to go to a craziness doctor a few years ago because she almost had a nervous breakdown. I thought it was funny though so maybe that's mean of me but if you knew my mother you would think it was funny too. She's not a very nice lady and she bothers me way too much. I wish she would stop calling and acting like that good little mother that she always want to be. She's not. I love my daddy. He called while PROPNAME was still in the bed this morning. Not good. He kept tickling me and my dad was kind of getting suspicious but PROPNAME plays too much anyway. I need to go take a nap and it's been more that twenty minutes so I'll talk to you later. 
__label__label0 I've never felt empty ever before, its amazing how complete your life feels for a certain time and then just because of this one person everything just falls apart and you have to start all over again I know it happens to everybody at some point of their lives but whoever it must be happening to they must be going through hell. I believe in god and I know that whatever he's doing its for my betterment but I wonder why he did this in the first place if he wasn't going to make it work. Right now there are so many questions in my mind but there is no one to answer them at all I'm feeling so disgusted with everything I feel angry and its all because on this one person who before a year didn't even mean anything to me and now rules over all my thoughts and feelings. I wish I could foresee the future or go back into time and fix up everything before it falls apart. I'm sitting in a lab full of people and my friends come every now and then and say hi to me and treat me sweetly and every other second my thoughts keep going back to this evil person who just messed up everything I do. I must be sounding like any girl who's fallen out of a relationship but I don't care I'm very hurt, and in my case I know he doesn't care at all whether I'm sad or depressed because he has someone else waiting for him at home who's going to make it alright for him and make him forget me forever and ever. and me? I m going to cry and keep thinking of him for a long time because I know I'm true and I loved him even if he didn't. So if I cry I know its because of the love I feel for him, and he doesn't care because he never really loved me at all, and I was stupid all the way to believe that he did. I promise never to be that stupid again I'm going to immerse myself in my work and other people and get on with my life whether my heart likes it or not because all this while I've been doing whatever my heart wanted me to do and didn't do whatever my brain wanted me to but now I'm going to think practically because I know that in this cruel world people who care for others get run over and only the cold hearted survive. So I am going to be cold hearted. and I'm going to be mean. sweet from the outside and mean from the inside just how he is. the whole world loves him because he's sweet from the outside but no one knows about how dark he is from the inside as bitter as an evil man who's never any good for anyone in his life. Where are people when you really need them, my parents so so far away who don't even have a clue about what's happening in my life. I'm so angry I could fight with the person and cry in front of him and take him in front of God and ask him to do justice for me if anybody in third world can't do it but I know I can't ask for anything like that ill just have to study move on and do great things with my life and make my parents really happy because they love me more than any guy in this world can ever do. As I write I'm waiting for these 00 minutes to get over so I can get out of this frame of mind and hide my thoughts in something else or just go stand outside in the warm sun and away from this computer where I feel I'm going to get an email from him at any minute. I hate being a slave to my thoughts and feelings I hate being an emotional slave to a guy who doesn't give a damn about me. I want everything to be right again. As it was before I want him to hug me when I'm tired and tell me that he cares for me oooh why does life have to be so difficult and challenging why can't it be stable is love too expensive to ask for or has it just become very rare in this world where people just care for themselves and nobody else. I can't write very quickly because I'm not that good at typing otherwise I can go on and on about this but then again I don't want to because I don t want to feel sorry for myself at all I'm beautiful, intelligent and there is someone out there who deserves me more then this selfish freak. 
__label__label0 Right now I'm sitting here at the computer wondering what I'm going to type for the next 00 minutes. There is someone outside in the apartment complex fumbling with their keys, perhaps trying to open their door. My computer is making some noise, and the apartment is really quiet so it seems very loud. I keep on making typing errors which is getting very annoying! There is a lot of stuff on my desk, I need to clear it off. I also need to clean up the kitchen cause there are lots of dishes that were left there last night when a couple of my friends came over last night. I forgot to get batteries for my walkman at the store yesterday too. I need to study for chemistry because I have a quiz in there at 00:00. I tried to last night, but I kept on getting distracted. I don't feel like doing this right now. I want to go to sleep. I just got back from calculus, which was an 0:00 class, and all I want to do is sleep. By the time I get the chance to, it will be time to leave again. I can't think of anything to type. I want to light a candle. I have a lot of time left and I still need to write. I'm not sure what about though. This weekend I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I guess I'll have fun. I did last weekend. I need to do some reading for my classes, and I can't wait until this day is over because my weekend can begin due to the fact that I don't have any classes on Friday. Right now I am thinking about different things we can plan for my best friend's surprise birthday in LOCNAME. We plan to have a party here for her too, but the one in LOCNAME will be a surprise because she has no idea that me and Dag are planning it. Next weekend I am going to the ORGNAME ORGNAME game and then right after that I plan on going home because the 00th is my Dad's birthday and the 00st is my brother's birthday. That will be a busy weekend. The following one is my friend's birthday. My computer is still making some annoying noise. I can't think of anything to type. I have 00 minutes left of typing. Hopefully I can come up with something for these remaining 00 minutes. I'm glad my apartment is on the 0nd floor because I noticed that yesterday when it rained that one of the apartments on the floor below had a puddle of water right in front of the door. That would be very annoying to deal with, if I lived there! So I'm glad I don't. Yesterday there was a lot of traffic. Today I get out of school at 0:00 and I have a trig review class at 0:00. I wish I didn't have to go, but I get extra credit for my calculus class, which I figure I will need. I need to balance my checkbook. I think I'll do that when I finish typing this. I'm going to listen to some CD's when I finish this too. I don't feel like studying, and I guess I'll have to figure out what to have for lunch. I wonder if the water filter we got makes the water taste different, I'll have to check that out in a minute. My desk is really cluttered, I need to get some envelopes and stamps, and mail those thank you letters that I keep on forgetting about. Well, I have a lot more stuff to do than I thought! It's driving me crazy that I keep on making so many typos, I never have this problem. Wow, I've finally written enough to start scrolling on the page! That's kind a cool. I thought that a I would have written more in 00 minutes though. I guess not. Surprisingly the time went by very quickly, I didn't think that it would. I guess in a minute I will log on so that I can get on to the psychology website and send this in. 
__label__label0 Ok, so I don't understand how people can get into relationships that are so suffocating. My friend was just telling me how his girlfriend was mad at just because he didn't call her right at 00am. He also told me that he couldn't tell his girlfriend that he was out with me at ORGNAME because then that would make her jealous. What kind of relationship is that when there is no trust, even though they say they love each other. Blah, blah, blah. They've been going out for less than 0 months and they are talking about love and marriage. I can't imagine falling in love so quickly. Maybe that is because I've never been in that situation before. My friends always ask why I don't date. I've been trying to figure out that myself. I usually use the "copout" answer that I don't have the time which is indeed true. I also think that I don't date because I haven't found the person who I click with. There are some friends I feel totally comfortable around, but they are too good of friends and that would be way too awkward. Supposedly, as others say, I could get any guy I want, but I totally doubt that. I guess I just have a low selfesteem, but I don't know. That's kind of an extreme statement to make. I think also I've been so independent all my life because of mommy and daddy always being at the restaurant that I basically raised myself. There could have been so many opportunities for me to turn bad, but I didn't. Yet, things my parents never think anything is good enough. I feel like they always see the bad in me. If I do something good, they praise that, but automatically follow with a negative quality about me. How do you think that makes me feel? What's the point of trying if nothing if ever good enough. I always do things to please others. I am doing pharmacy because my parents want me to and I don't want to disappoint them because I see how hard they work and what they have gone through with my brother. I sometimes get so depressed when I realize that they are putting all their hopes on me and they make me feel guilty when I don't do what they want me to do. Sometimes I feel it is too much pressure on me and I just want to cry and give up everything. Don't they understand that that is too much pressure for me and that I might crack one day and go crazy. Sometimes I always ask why me and why my family. like why are we going through these tough financial situations when we are such good people. But then I realize how lucky we are. We have a home, food, and all the people in my immediate family are healthy and living. I hear horror stories of what other people have to suffer through and I make it a point to not take anything for granted because EVERYTHING could completely change in a blink of an eye. I also ask why are all the girls so much prettier than me and why I'm not as smart as others. Then I hear kids that are born with mental retardation and makes me realize how lucky I am to be healthy and normal. It so hard sometimes to see of all the good things you have when you envy what others have. That's a serious problem I have. I should just be content with what I have and not worry about what others have. I like to be nice to others but when I see my friends giving more attention and things to my other friend who is always mean and whiney, what's the use of being nice and submissive. Why do all the good "guys" lose? I guess that is just how the world works and that is so pathetic. I guess that is how human nature is. I went to the UT Dance Clinic tonight and I wish I was good enough to make it. I just don't pick up combinations up as quickly as the other girls. I wish I could because I really want to make it. I love to dance. I wish I could do that for the rest of my life but I am not good enough to make it my profession. It is so relaxing and I truly love doing it. I don't think pharmacy is what I want to do for the rest of my life. It seems to boring. But I have absolutely no idea what I want to do. I guess I haven't found my niche in the world. I wish I just knew what I wanted to do and go with it. Why do I change my mind so often? Life would be so much easier if I could just figure out what exactly I wanted to do with my life. I just hope my future is all I hope it to be. happy, prosperous, healthy, and with someone I truly love. 
__label__label1 ok its 0000. here I go I feel like I'm the bum in waiting for godot. just write continuously, ha I keep messing up I can't keep up wait her I go there are my typing skills or not I wonder how I should take over the world I keep building up my bases on alpha centauri but the drones keep rioting its always on the bases that were conquered why don't the other leaders realize that drones aren't as efficient as people. if any of the other leaders attacks me I'm going to have more trouble this time because my military is outdated, but hopefully it wont be to them my tech is still ahead but I don't know how far ahead. I guess PROPNAME's leaving about now, she's naive sometimes what's it like at this mixer its where a bunch of frat guys hit on you what a match its when whichever one hit on you successfully tries to get you drunk and take advantage of you I can't believe there's a theme, I thought we grew out of it in high school. I don't like the idea of some of the things she wants to do I don't know if she's naive or if she's pretending I don't think it would be as big a deal if had pledged this semester in some ways I like it but in a lot of others I really don't it surprising to hear blake pledged, I don't know if he wants to be friends,,. ,. friends. I wish had some. I'm getting to know more people like in my study group but everyone here seems to have their own agenda. its harder making friends than I thought I thought more people would be looking to make friends. the guys next door are in a fight I bet its about that time when pot luck people decide if they're going to get along, I don't like my roommate, but at least I already found someone to switch with he's always on my computer when I get home, he jumps up like I wont know that just implies guilt or hell try and explain, its just annoying he's supposed to get one man. I'm not a very fast typist I better get better if I want that secretarial job. I wonder what everybody's doing tonight I wish I had more friends like me. I need to remember to get my shots tomorrow. I'm running out of things to think about all this thinking is making me tired, well there's the answer to your survey, thinking makes you tired and since stressed people get less sleep they're more tired so I must be more stressed right, wrong that's getting an explanation from correlation, you can't do that, see I get this stuff I don't want to have to relearn the brain, I already did that in bio in high school, o wait I ran over the time, I'm done 
__label__label1 All I can really think about is how incredibly tired I am. My sleeping schedule has been severely altered. I stay up until 0:00 or 0:00 every night studying, then to get up at 0:00 or so to go to class. Surprisingly going back to the discussion in class, I am not especially stressed although I never seem to be. The only thing I ever stress about in PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and some of my other troubled friends. PROPNAME really is the source of all my stress right now (little as it is). I worry about him all the time. Not that I don't think he can take care of himself, because he is incredibly independent. I just think that maybe if I worry about it, it will do some good. There's my logic as usual it's very skewed. I am so incredibly tired. I can't help but think that if anyone reads this, they must be thinking that I lead the most unproductive life at LOCNAME. This really isn't the case. I just tend to sleep during the day, leaving all my studying to be done at night, and then stay up late doing that it's a vicious cycle of, well, laziness I suppose not necessarily unproductive. People can be lazy and still manage to be productive; there is a difference. This difference is vaguely present in my mind, and in my state of complete exhaustion, I am not capable of articulating it. I can't even make a coherent sentence describing my inability to articulate. I have Biology in an hourI don't want to go, but I know I will. I haven't developed that skill that comes to every college student. The one where you can miss class, and not panic, or feel remotely guilty for wasting your parents' money. I suppose this is a good thing though. I am staring at the foam brain resting on my computer speaker. There is something strangely humorous about it again; I can't even begin to articulate what it is. Just a foamy brain, portables, small, and somehow humorous. My sense of humor is rather odd. I have gathered this from several sources: the fact that PROPNAME PROPNAME is the greatest series ever made, the fact that foam brains are hilarious, and the fact that I can laugh at anything without having any real reason. Random laughter. It's good in some ways. This doesn't look like twenty minutes of writing, but I suppose that if I have been typing for twenty minutes, then this is twenty minutes worth of writing. I am so smart I amaze others and myself. 
__label__label0 Well, I've never really done a stream of consciousness writing, so hopefully this will be a good experience for me. Right now, I'm thinking about thinking about writing this, its kind of weird to just record everything that crosses your mind because you get weird recursive loops like that. Recursion is the idea that a certain function calls itself, or in layman's terms, an idea that is selfreferencing. I think PROPNAME was the one who taught me about the idea of a selfreferencing mathematical idea. I just found out today that the classes I plan on taking over the next 0 and a half years will earn me a BS in Computer science, and a BS in Mathematics. At first I just wanted to take a minor in mathematics, but when I was talking to Dr. PROPNAME today he told me that I should check to see how much of the major I would be completing. I hope a double major will help me get into grad school. Right now I really want to go to PROPNAME PROPNAME to do my grad work. They have a really great CS program there. That's assuming of course that I remain a CS major over the next few years. But I don't see my interests changing or anything. I really wonder how well shy people can perform stream of consciousness. We're really not good at expressing our thoughts, especially to other people. Luckily this is typed and not spoken. Well, that's both good and bad, typing runs much more slowly than speaking, but its easier to express my self through text than through words. I misspelled consciousness earlier, and it got underlined red. Its really bugging me, so I think I'll go fix it right now. I know that if I look around my room I'll see something that I want to talk about. Usually that subject will be computer related. Its really sad. (Sad but true dear reader) Why does that make me think of high school. Weird flashback I guess. Never really popular or anything, although the last two years were awesome because I had a great group of friends and together we were really outgoing and audacious. All extremely intelligent. I wish I could meet more intelligent people here. Most of the people I know are either average, or just plain dumb. I did meet some cool people in my CS 000 class. But its too early to tell if they're truly intelligent, or just book smart. That reminds me of the math problem I solved today. Professor Freed always gives out a few homemade math problems on his assignments. He encourages us to attempt them, but he says its ok if we don't actually finish them or anything. Well, so far I'm the only one I know who came up with a solution to his problem. The last part was awesome because it required the use of a computer. I wrote a dinky little program in C to compute all the data, and then I pasted it all into Excel to plot it. Right now I have another program like that running. Its been running for about 000 hours right now. Something like that. Its growing neural networks to survive in a certain situation. These aren't any old artificial neural networks though, they're growth modeled. (my idea). So I hope this new batch of data continues to support my hypothesis. The rhythmic clicking of the keys is kind of distracting. It reminds me of our last psych class, when the girl I sat by thought that if you could type faster than you could write, it was pretty fast. I really disagree. Writing free hand is an extremely slow process, typing goes much faster because the letters are formed instantly when you hit the key. You can't program as fast as you can type so it really doesn't matter for me except in word processing like this, where I need to be able to type as fast as I can or I can't remember what I was thinking. I wonder how long I've been typing. Probably at least 00 minutes. I really haven't been keeping time. Oh well, once this hits a page on size 00 times new roman, that's going to be a lot of text in a fixed point font (like its going to be when I paste it on the web). My DVD player comes in pretty soon. I've been waiting for at least a month because the first one I got didn't work, and then the company ran out of them. I need to buy some DVDs for it. Probably will get the ORGNAME DVDs even though they don't cover the really good episodes at the end. I like anime. 
__label__label1 I just started college last week. It's hard to believe I am finally here. I have been coming to LOCNAME for football games as long as I can remember, but I always go home when they are over. This time I am staying and my family is going home. It's so hard for me to think I will be spending the next four years here. It's so big and full of so many people. The first day of class I didn't know what to think. I was so overwhelmed by it all. I decided to go through rush here at LOCNAME, and that was an experience all on it's own. It was a week full of stress, and aching feet. You are surrounded by a bunch of girls that are trying to out do the next and you can't really tell if people are being fake or themselves. I just hoped for the best and tried to have fun. Now that it is all over and I made my bid. I was relieved a little, but not enough. The day after rush ended classes begin. I had no time to relax or get things together. I was stressing out more than I had ever before. I didn't know where my classes were, I missed my friends and family, my roommate and I have been a little off, it seemed like nothing was going right. I really wanted to cry. It's so hard for me to think that I am not happy here because I can vividly recall not too long ago saying that I couldn't wait to get out of high school and get to college. I was so excited about moving to LOCNAME. I didn't think I would miss my family too much because they would be coming down for all the home football games. Boy, was I wrong. I told everyone that I wouldn't think of going home my first weekend of college, but as I sat in my dorm room last Friday thinking about all my friends going home for the holiday I don't think I could have packed up my stuff any quicker. I was so excited about going home. I couldn't wait to get there. Even though I did homework and laid around most of the weekend it was very nice to just relax and not have to worry about anything. There are so many things to do in Austin and even when you say your not going out, someone is always trying to talk you into going somewhere. My past week of college has been fun, but scary. I am not use to being so unorganized. I need a schedule and a daily routine, so I won't feel so strung out and frazzled. So many things have been going through my head, about college and how I feel about it and I can't exactly put it all into words. When people ask me about school I don't know what to tell them. I wish I could say I love it and I am having a blast, but I would be lying. I have had fun, but I am kind of scared and homesick and I feel like I am in a maze and I can't find my way out. I don't think I am making any sense. My feelings are just all jumbled up and I can't seem to sort through them. I need direction. I am hoping every week will get better and I will gradually find my way and start to feel at home here. 
__label__label0 Ever since this assignment was introduced in class, I've been trying to think about what to write (which totally defeats the purpose of the assignment). It's just that when I sit down at the computer to type something, I usually have a plan or goal in mind, whether it is to write a report about something or type an email to a friend. Never have I just had to sit at a computer and type whatever comes to my mind. I guess that makes me a bit boring in a way because I find it so hard to express myself at times. The other day when you were talking about obsessivecompulsive people, my roommate turned to me and said, "That's you!" I guess I had never really thought about that label applying to me. But once you started listing examples, I had an epiphany. I guess I am obsessivecompulsive in some ways. I like everything neat, clean, and orderly. I can't stand having a dirty living space. I mean, how can you sleep and use the bathroom in a dirty environment? For me, it's just not possible. Plus, I think it's important to be neat and clean because that's the first thing people see when they walk into your room, and how you maintain your room really tells a lot about your personality. I like to make good first impressions and the way I maintain my room is a way of achieving that. I think I get a lot of this from my mother because she's really picky about the way she likes to do things. I remember one time I started doing the dinner dishes for her while she was outside in the backyard and when she came in, she pretty much kicked me out of the kitchen because I wasn't washing the dishes "the right way. " Of course I can't really complain because I do a lot of that too. I understand that everyone has their own way of doing things, but I just like to do things my way because I see the logic in it. A lot of my friends think I'm a freak for being so neat, clean, and organized, but if I wasn't, I can't even imagine what my life would be like. Being clean and organized is what brings stability into my life. It is something that will never change. I guess I shouldn't say that because every time I say I will never do something, I end up doing it later on. For example, when I was younger, I told my older sister I would never wear lipstick or any other makeup and now if you look in my purse, you will see powder, two shades of lipstick, and lipliner. So I guess that's why I should never say never. I have so much to do today. I probably should have done it yesterday instead of sleeping and watching television all day. Of course I had fun doing crossword puzzles and playing Jeopardy online with my boyfriend. I've always loved playing intellectual games. It makes me feel great when I can answer a question or figure out a word on a puzzle because people are really smarter than they think. Sometimes you think you don't remember anything from a class you took sophomore or junior year in high school, but then it pops up in a Jeopardy question and you know the answer to it. It amazes me the things I remember from some of my classes in high school. And sometimes, that information came from classes that I thought were totally useless at that time. Now, I realize that there's no such thing as useless information (except for maybe Calculus when you're studying to be a Communications major). 
__label__label1 I hope that I am doing this assignment correctly. I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester. I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I don't want to wake up early tomorrow. Maybe I won't be tired. I probably will. I wish PROPNAME would hurry up and call me. I get tired of waiting. I need to do homework for math, but I don't really know how. I also don't want to go to Spanish tomorrow. I want my mom to buy me a new cell phone. I'm very glad this week is almost over. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll be very busy, but I'll have a lot of fun. I really hope that the guy I called today about buying his puppy doesn't sell it before I can have enough money to buy it. I'm so full. I shouldn't have eaten so much dinner. I hope my friend PROPNAME isn't mad at me for not calling her back for two weeks. I really don't want to go to school anymore. I wish I was married to a professional athlete or something. I'm very tired today even though I got plenty of sleep last night. My mom is so nice, but she gets so annoying sometimes. I feel really bad for being rude to her sometimes, but she treats me like I am in junior high sometimes. Probably because I'm the baby and she misses all her kids. I wish she would get a job or something so that she'd have something to do since my dad's never there for her. Maybe PROPNAME is home and he's calling me but he can't get hold of me because I am on the computer. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than you'd think. I don't think I have ever typed for twenty minutes straight before. The computer even thinks so. Now I'm going to have to resign online for the tenth time. Very annoying. I really just want to crawl into my bed right now. I would much rather sleep than do my homework but I guess I had better do my homework so I don't ruin my ORGNAME. Even though I'm sure it won't be as high this semester as last year. Oh well, it's not really my fault. I really don't think all that much in my head I don't believe because I am running out of things to type. I wish that I was in the Caymans with all of my friends right now. That would be so much fun. Maybe over Christmas or something. I think that not everyone could afford it though. I am so glad that I am still on my parents' payroll. I would be nowhere without it. I can't believe some people have to pay for their tuition and things like that. I couldn't imagine, but then again most of them are married or have babies or both. I definitely could not imagine that either. I wish I could stay this age or younger forever. Preferably a freshman in college. I really didn't realize how much fun I was having until I had to grow up a year. I hope that I am doing this assignment correctly. I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester.

__label__label0 Coming to this first year in a totally different new atmosphere for school, I knew there were many challenges. I think of the freedom of the lifestyle I'll be in as well as the work that I have to put into in getting the grades like how I did in high school. Wow, what a difference in lifestyle. I can come back to my dorm and go back to sleep after one class instead of having to go through a whole day like in high school and then finally going home and sleeping. But, its not like I don't sleep during class anyways. The ethernet connection here as had me in awe. After many years using my mediocre 00. 0 modem, the ethernet connection has been a blast. This is the first time I actually had to do an assignment online and send it online. so that's quite a change as well. I'll find that I might do less writing now, now that there are computers to do the writing for us. Living in the a dorm and around your peers usually lets u see any internal problems closeup when it happens. I've seen this already. It's not like everyday school life when you go home and ponder about the issue and go back to school the next day to see it again, or have to go on the phone and talk about it. Here, you meet the issues face to face usually, depending on where your peers live. You and your peers will get used to how each other lives, the way they eat, sleep, or drink. I'll see how I will get through this year  
__label__label0 At first when I came to UT I was really scared that I was not going to make any friends. Right away I met many people and made many acquaintances. I am not sure I have made any really good friends. I feel lonely many of the times even though I am constantly around different people. For me to feel good is to be loved and that is not happening. First of all, I have no family near me which removes that area of love. My best friend, LOCNAME, is one who I can turn to. or so I thought. He seemed to have become distant from me than usual and I did not appreciate it. Actually it made me jealous because I need attention. So then I began to think that I might like him more than a friend. One of my good friends ended up telling him that I like him. It made things worse than before. But now he likes me and still wants to date other people. I think I really like him so this bugs me. I don't know what I should tell him. I think that he does not like me the way I like him. He told me he was going to come over today but he did not. He did not even bother to call and let me know that he was not going to come. He is probably out, clubbing or something. It was rude of him to not even give me a call. Situations such as these make we wonder if anyone really does care about me. I feel like some how I am always betrayed. Why is that? I wish I could be happy in my life. That is all that I ask for and wish for in my life. I feel like nothing really makes me happy. I am not saying I am always sad and my life sucks because this is not the case. I am just saying that sometimes I am sad and maybe sometimes I am content with my life. Content is not good enough for me. I want true happiness and not by myself but with another person. I am trying to find that happiness but it is way out of my reach. Why is that? Why me? I ask myself these questions all the time and ponder to myself. I think that in life I will never really be successful or anything because I get lonely really easily. I can't even go to the store by myself or to the grocery store. I need someone to go with me. Is that a bad thing? I think that it is because I am not very independent. I want to have someone with me all the time because I like the company. My best friend also tells me that I crave attention. I don't know about all that. Maybe I do though, who knows? School is stressful for me. There is so much studying to do and I feel like I have no time to do it. There is time though but I don't like to be alone. And to study you need to be alone to really get things done right. I guess I just need to figure out my stuff and then everything will be ok. Hopefully all will work out best. 
__label__label1 It's hard to believe that my first year ORGNAME college has begun. It's almost like I am at summer camp for a week, and I will be returning home in a week. However, that is just a false reality in my head. It's hard for me to grasp everything. It seemed to happen so fast. I left behind my family, my friends, my cheerleading squad, my town. Everything that is familiar has been traded in for a world of experience and confusion. What time is my next class? Where IS my next class? Where is everyone going tonight? It's mass confusion in my head. I want to be successful at college: academically, spiritually, emotionally and physically. I have already begun a steady workout and eating habits that make me feel good about my self, and so far I have enjoyed all of my classes. However, there's still that little thought in the back of my head that I am not getting everything done. I feel like there's this list of things to do ALL THE TIME and no matter what I do, I will never get them done. I have to admit, my first week of college was completely awful. I hated every moment of it. I cried everyday, called my mom, acted like a real baby. It was as if there was this strike against me that made sure NOTHING went my way. But as I have gotten used to the schedule and made a few new friends things seem to be looking up. I still feel like I don't fit in. This miniature "society" at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME is like a town within itself, and all of the citizens in this "town" seem so superficial. I don't feel like I have met anyone with one natural thought in his or her head. I can't believe how strange it is. It's as if the whole campus is full of sorority girls and fraternity guys. (No offense, it's just not me) I want to feel like a part of things but for the life of me I can't get in "the loop. " I make a few friends here and there, but as far as personalities, I feel like I am too real for everyone I have met. I am hoping that by next semester I will begin to make this dorm room my home and the people around me my family. It's not so much that I am homesick as it that I just miss fitting in. Back in High School there were no worries. Everything was laid out for you; only a few minor decisions to be made. I fit in so well. I knew my way around, I knew what was going on at all times; it was like a utopia in my little town of Sugar Land, LOCNAME. The only problem with the whole "high school thing" is that I was definitely a stereotype. (Another superficial moment in my life) I was a cheerleader all through High School. People at my school assumed I was a snobby, selfish girl who only thought the world of myself as well as my other cheerleader friends. They never even got the chance to know me. I can say right off- I am far from snobby. I love everyone and everything in this world. I am out to harm no one, except my self emotionally every once in a while! Why do teenagers feel the need to be so judgmental of each other? Why is it that I can't drive my Mustang Convertible in my cheerleading uniform without feeling like I am straight out of a "Saved By The Bell" episode? I am thinking that over time, an image has been created in everyone's mind on how things should be, and how people should look. Who is to say who and what we are? Why do I feel like I am always answering to someone? I can't make a decision without someone LOVING IT and someone else HATING IT. I hate the fact that the media has pounded into our brains what and who we should be. This is real life people. When you are doled out your genes-physical and personality-you don't get a choice. Some people honestly can't help the way they are. So why do we take the time to stop and make them feel even worse about their insecurities? I think the answer is within our OWN insecurities. It's sick that people feel better about themselves after putting someone else down. If a girl thinks she has ugly hair, she may announce that "that girl over there" has a horrible sense of fashion. Does that take away from the fact that she has ugly hair? I don't think so! So why has it become so necessary to step on whomever it takes to make you look better? My mind is full of these questions. I just know that as long as I am here, I plan to stay the real, down to earth girl that I am, as to not become a victim of my own insecurities. 
__label__label1 What does the drug ecstasy do to the brain? I have been very curious about this for some time now. Maybe you could tell us what studies have concluded about this drug. The reason why I am so curious is because many of my friends have recently discovered and become enchanted with it. In fact, in about the middle of the second semester of my senior year in high school, it became almost like an ecstasy epidemic! Several of my friends have done it up to 00 or 00 times already! I haven't tried it since I refuse to do drugs but I'm really interested to find out what its long term effects are and why it produces the reaction that it does. Apparently, when on ecstasy, it feels as if nothing can go wrong and everything is perfect. LOCNAME is everything and once listening, someone who is rolling (the term used to define the feeling one gets after taking X) can't pull away. Also, they say they feel as if they have "lungs of steel" in that they are constantly smoking cigarettes and feel as if they can't stop. Oh, and the mouth chewing. Why does that happen? Their mouths jitter while they're rolling and after the drug wears off, their mouths hurt or feel sore. That's why you can tell when someone is rolling at a party. Well, first of all they're sweating profusely and also they're chewing lots and lots of gum! Its crazy actually. I went to a rave with my friends last Saturday. It was at LOCNAME Music LOCNAME. At least 00% of the people attending the rave was rolling on X. Well, essentially, that's what rave's are for. Its a closed space with djs who spin techno and trance music for a huge group of people, the majority of whom is PROPNAME like crazy! Anyway, my friends had a blast there. of course they were rolling. I had fun too, but not nearly as much I imagine! In fact, it was 0:00 in the morning, we had been dancing for at least 0 hours straight, and one of my friends refused to leave because he was rolling so hard and not remotely tired. Doesn't this sound crazy? What does the drug do to people? Have any severe, longlasting consequences been discovered for sure. I've been told several theories, some of which include the brain bleeding, there being permanent damage on the spine, memory loss, and brain cells being killed. Sounds like some dangerous stuff these people are playing around with. If it weren't an illegal drug, I'd definitely try it (provided it didn't totally screw me up in the future!) considering how wonderful everyone tells me it is. And not just word of mouth. I've seen people on it countless times. They look as if they could die happy right then and there! I don't know if you're planning on discussing anything like this in class but I'm really interested in finding out more about X. Just out of curiosity! Well, I think I'd like to talk about something remotely related. One of the guys whom I'm talking about, in fact, he's in this class with me, is named J. I went to high school with him but we were never friends. We hung out at the same parties with the same group of people generally, but we barely even talked to each other. Well he and his friend are living at Towers together and since we're all down here together we've been hanging out a lot. A whole lot, in fact. And I wasn't really planning on anything happening between us but the night of the rave, a lot of people stayed the night at their place, including me, and we kind of "hooked up. " Now, ever since then, we've kind of been messing around well, nothing much. The thing is, we haven't mentioned it to each other at all. We keep doing it but don't discuss it. So I'm not sure what the deal is. I think I like him. well, actually, yes I do like him. The problem is. does he like me? I can't tell either way. I mean, he's a guy so just the fact that he keeps fooling around with me doesn't mean much. He could hate my guts for all I know and still be doing what he's doing just to get some! That would really suck. And I don't want to ask him because, well for one, I wouldn't know what to say. And for two, I'm scared of the answer. That would just be awful if I spill my guts and he totally cops out. And what's worse is if that happens, not only are we in this class together, but we have to go to the same school for the next four years! What should I do? I don't know. I hope something happens soon that'll figure this out for me well, something GOOD that is! I've written a lot more than twenty minutes so I should probably go now. I guess this wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Whew!

__label__label0 I just set my alarm on ORGNAME cell phone because I didn't want to over write or something. I'm listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME's song. It's called ORGNAME the ORGNAME, I think. I don't know if I was supposed to put quotations around the title of the song. Yes, I'm sure that's what I was supposed to do. This writing assignment is kind of weird cause I don't know what I'm supposed to be writing about and sometimes this freedom makes me kind of weird on the subject. Too much freedom isn't always comfortable, I guess. I can't stop thinking about how bad I feel that I didn't go to my philosophy class on Tuesday. It's not because the professor sucks. Or at least I don't think it is cause I know he does kind of not get the point across. He's too vague. too much vagueness and too much freedom. Both are not good especially if you want structure. I need structure in my life. I do because sometimes I think that I know what I'm doing and what I want to do but it just doesn't work out that way and I think it's because I just want things to be scheduled or I can't get them done. I don't' know how to structure my life, though. This song makes me so depressed even though I like it a lot. I don't know what to write about. I don't know if I'm supposed to continuously type, without stopping, or if I can stop to think about what I want to write about but not get away from the computer. I feel like my writing isn't quality writing here, but I guess that's the point of writing this. I've been writing for four minutes. I know. I stopped to look at the clock. I want to talk to my boyfriend. We got into a fight today because he was upset that I didn't call him and went over to a friend's dorm room. I know that's not what he's upset about though. I know it's because this friend of mine is a guy. I hate that he's so jealous like that. I mean, I don't mind if he wants to show me that he cares, but getting upset with me and hanging up with me like that, I just don't like. Especially embarrassing me in front of my friend. I've known my friend, PROPNAME, longer than I have been with my boyfriend. I don't' know. I guess my boyfriend is just paranoid. I love him a lot though. I just wish we had what we had in the beginning of our relationship: blind love and trust. I don't know. I guess that once you go out with someone for so long, things just fly away and you're left with what you always thought you weren't going to do and be and say and feel. I understand why some women cry about their husbands beating them but yet they don't leave. It's called love with a condition. She loves him because she's been with him for so long. I'm thinking that maybe if I didn't type so fast, I wouldn't end up with too much for this writing assignment. First of all, I think this is the coolest writing assignment. Not only because we have this freedom, which I think can get a little demanding. I think it's neat because we can write what we think. It isn't an essay on the revolution of blah blah. It's what I feel and think and want to say, which is always nice, especially in writing. I'm used to doing this though I guess cause I write in my journal often. I never type though, so I guess I'm getting more said. And believe it or not, I always worry about space on my journal. Like, I worry that I'll "waste" too many spaces on only one entry. I think I'm so weird. I guess I do kind of like to keep things in order and not waste too much. I am like that in many ways I guess. But I'm also guessing it's a better trait to have than not. I don't know. My computer is making funny noises. I hate my computer cause I paid close to two thousand dollars for it and it doesn't even shut down properly. Plus, stupid ORGNAME won't help me any. I write them and tell them of my technical problem and they just reply to my emails with dumb strategies that don't even work. I've already tried a million times. It makes me want to not fix it at all and just shut it down with the power surge adaptor under my desk. I miss home. I wish I could go home and be with my mom and not worry about money or food or weight. I'm gaining so much weight. I lost about ten pounds my senior year and everybody was complaining that I looked anorexic. Now that I'm in LOCNAME, I've already gained those ten back and I'm scared that now I'll turn into too big of a girl, that ill be that girl, the bigger one than all the other girls. I was only maybe 000 pounds but because all of my friends weighed 00, I looked bigger. Maybe that's why they never wanted to go out with me. I don't know. Maybe it's cause I'm Korean, I don't look like most of the people where I'm from. The LOCNAME LOCNAME valley: either you're Mexican or some type of Mexican. Even the general white population was considered a minority there. Anyway but yeah I used to be cheerleader/student council president and all other kinds of stuff in junior high and I got to high school and cheerleading sucked because I was a freshman and everything else sucked. All my friends turned into druggies. About half of them went to rehab. I feel bad for them. But then again. I don't know. They're here at LOCNAME with me. Well, most of them. Does that mean I'm almost equivalent to a druggie? I've never done any drug besides drinking and smoking cigarettes and even that I don't do often. I wish I could find answers to some stupid questions that are so insignificant. Whatever. All I know is that I want my future to bright and successful. I actually want to write. I want to sit and write my poems and my thoughts and write a book, but I know that won't ever be possible. I wouldn't' be able to do it as my job, my career. I know I need food to eat and money to pay bills with and writing books, especially when you're barely starting off, won't get you too much on the table and in your pockets. I don't know. I wish I had the patience to go through medical school but I don't think I could, and besides, I suck at sciences. I would never be able to go through all those damn chemistry and biology classes. I would die. I really would. Why would I want to shoot so high for a career that will only bog me down with way too many hours? Actually, the guy I was talking about before, PROPNAME, he has an uncle who is a doctor and he's so rich and makes his own hours, basically. He's working in the ER right now because he likes to travel, and ER doctors can usually go work at whatever hospital. I'm so tired. My shoulders hurt. My boyfriend is coming tomorrow to see me. I'm so excited. We've been going out for two years. It's like we're both from the valley and it's like I'm going to be able to see a part of the old me, at home. I haven't seen him for two weeks, which is nothing compared to the long separation periods when I was a senior in high school and he was a freshman up at ORGNAME. yup, he's an aggie. Funny how I got to be a longhorn. I don't even have all that pride in being one. I didn't even look into buying a sports packet to go watch the game. I wish I was back to being my peppy self like I was in junior high. Did I kill myself? Or did I let other people kill me? Did I let other people tell me I wasn't good enough? I don't know. I want it to be 0:00 so I can stop writing. My shoulders hurt and my neck hurts. I feel too pressured doing this. But yet, I like this writing assignment. 
__label__label0 Well, since I don't know how to start, I'll start by talking about my weekend. I just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. We started Saturday. Buck, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Crystal, and I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME with my new boat. I made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. I actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. The only problem is that it hurts when you fall. I broke my nose the first time that I fell because I kneed myself in the face. I spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. The only problem with Saturday is that Crystal and PROPNAME got into a fight. They've been dating for a couple of weeks now. Anyway, we went back to the lake Sunday and I kept trying different things and now I'm pretty good on one ski. And it is a blast, I'll never go back to two skis. Sunday night I played the role of mediator for everyone. I talked to Crystal about PROPNAME and I talked to PROPNAME about Crystal. They are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. Then I talked to PROPNAME about Buck. PROPNAME is one of Crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. She liked Buck a lot. Buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. Right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. This is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. At least as far as I can tell. But I did a lot of talking and more importantly listening Sunday. I think I helped smooth everything over with them for now. PROPNAME and Crystal seem to be getting along better. I missed classes Monday because of injuries that I received over the weekend. I broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. I couldn't even get out of bed Monday morning. I'm starting to recover though. I had to go to work Tuesday. I work at Internet Gateway in LOCNAME. I love working there except that I don't get paid near what I should be getting. I make $0/hr. That should be 00 times more, but I only work 0 days a week anyway. I was working full time but I decided that since I have to go to school, I should make it my top priority. I didn't want to go to college, I'm not sure that I want to now that I'm going; but I know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. That's really the only reason I'm going is because my mom wanted me to. Actually my whole family was pushing me to go. This is OK though because I know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. Especially when I start looking for a better paying job. Although, college has been really fun so far. I have had my own house since this summer. Buck and I are roommates and we are renting a house in LOCNAME. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that I have my own place. Buck and I met at work. His dad owns the company where I am employed and he started working there during the spring. We have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. He is a good guy. We have a lot in common too. I've been lucky in that regard. I have a lot of good friends, and several that I can depend on for anything. It is a really good feeling to know that I can trust someone like Buck with my life. I've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. My stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. PROPNAME, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. Well, I've put over my 00 minutes into this paper, and I have to go back to work now. 
__label__label0 At this time in my life, my feelings have been tossed around in my mind. My stress level at the moment is much then I think that it has ever been. From what I have heard, the degree ORGNAME difficulty in college is the highest possible. This worries me because I know that I am able of fulfilling my college experience, but the problem for me will be if I am able to apply myself. Application is an important aspect of college, and I really do not know if I will be able to focus as much as I should on my schoolwork. Another thing that has raised my stress level is women. With women, my mind has many feelings. One minute I will want to be with my old girlfriend, and the next I want to be with a new girl. My mind thinks about it consistently. Sometimes in class I find my mind drifting into places that it should not. This is when my brain realizes that I need to be focusing more on school in order to fulfill my dream. The stress in my life eventually comes to raise my anger level, at least that is the way I see it. When I get stressed out, I tend to want to release my anger by playing hockey. I feel that it helps me release my stress and my anger because it is something that will always be there for me, and my mind knows that it will be. Therefore, I tend to play better when I am angered because I become more aggressive. At least this is what I have noticed while playing. Feelings are a strange thing. The stuff above, I wrote about two days ago. Now it seems as if my whole perspective on life has changed. My mind has just switched due to a few events that have probably changed the whole outcome of my life. My mind used to hate all schoolwork what so ever, but now that I have grown physically and mentally, I actually enjoy reading and learning new information. I do not know why it intrigues me, but for some reason it does and I like it. I have recently discovered that I love math and I believe that it is what I would like to do with my life. I am considering strongly of changing majors from business to some field of mathematics. I believe that it would be really interesting to be able to be a professor for a math class or to do something else in life that involves complications in mathematics. The thing is, I am afraid to change my major, because I kind of think that I might regret. Getting into the business school is a hard thing to do at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, and many people would consider it a stupid thing to get out of it. But from what I have seen so far in BA000 it does not seem as interesting to me as math. I like math so much because there is pretty much always a way to compute the answer to a problem. Knowing and understanding how and why the fundamentals work is the hardest and most time consuming part of math. But once one understands the fundamentals of math, they are capable of doing any form of math problem similar to the one that they understand. For many people, math is the enemy of all subjects. I personally do not like memorizing history or stupid biology stuff. I believe that is why I like math so much, because it is much easier for me to relate to. In a way, my body almost feels deprived because I have not played hockey in nearly 0 weeks. When I used to play at least 0 times a week. I feel like I am not exercising and that I am becoming unhealthy. This weekend, I will hopefully be able to satisfy this hunger for hockey when I go home. Hockey is most likely my favorite thing to do in life, I believe that it is because of the adrenaline rush and it helps relieve stress. Without it, I think my stress level is higher then normal because the stress is not relieved like it is used to being released. College should be an interesting experience. What is to come I do not really know yet, but I am sure that it will be a very interesting experience. Like my sister said, just make sure that you have as much fun as possible and make as good of grades as possible. 
__label__label1 Ok, so I'm sitting here wondering what I'm going to eat for dinner, even though I'm not hungry. My roommate just told me what there is at jester and she also told me that she waited to do her homework until I woke up because she didn't want the printer to wake me up. She is so sweet. She has selfesteem issues that she takes medication for and for the life of me I can't understand people like this. It's like I want to just tell them to snap out of it. It's very frustrating for me because I don't understand it. She and I talked about this issue last night before we went to sleep. I told her how I felt and we've come to an understanding. I'm starting to miss my parents. I feel very sad for my mother because I know she misses me a lot. I don't tell my mother often enough how much I love and respect her I should do this. I stood in line for an hour today for football tickets for the OU game in LOCNAME. I love it here but it will be nice to return to a place I am so familiar with. I hope PROPNAME forgets about her exboyfriend PROPNAME. She is so cool. I am really glad we met one another. He is such a weirdo and she is so smart and independent and ambitious. I don't see how she does it. I mean, she's doing the ORGNAME TV station thing and Comm council and an internship at the capitol, and 00 hrs. and she just has to obtain a 0. 0 or she'll just die. Me on the other hand, I'm just trying to make it here. I'm used to doing it all. I handled everything going on in High School, but that was dealing with 000 people and easy classes that I swore were hard. I just really hope I make the novice rowing team here. I've put so much time and energy in preparation for tryouts. I work out everyday and go out of my way to get noticed. PROPNAME just called about us going to get our meningitis shots tomorrow. I also need to get my chicken pox vaccination because I've never had them and I don't want to get them now, because I'm afraid I'll like die or something. My mother should have exposed me to them when I was a child. I just saw PROPNAME and she wasn't very nice. I hope she's not mad at me. I have to go to the boathouse and run a lot tomorrow and I'm sitting here dreading it. But, if I make the team it will all be worth it. My roommate snores really loud at night. I plug my ears with cotton. It angers me. It's very difficult to sleep. I have so many things to do. I feel like there aren't enough hours in the day to do what I need to get done. Austin is really hot. I hope PROPNAME and PROPNAME work things out. He loves her so much and I really want them to be together. I'm thinking about the OU game again. I am so excited to see him and my other cousin. They are big UT fans. They are so happy that I am going here. I almost feel bad, because I guess I didn't really consider it that big of a deal that I got in. Everywhere I go, people look at me in awe when I tell them I go to school here. Well, I'm going to stop writing now. It's been 00 minutes and all I can think about is all the stuff I have to do now. I have Journalism, Rhetoric and Geography homework so I'm going to get started. 
__label__label0 I hate the guy next door to me He is so fricking annoying. PROPNAME I want to kill him. His music is blasting so loud right now and I can't even think and he's just talking away and I want to go to sleep and take a nap I think I only got like a couple of hours of sleep last night so I'm tired and I didn't get to eat breakfast My bed makes all these squeaky noises when I sleep and it's really annoying and my pillows keep following off the bed I don't like my green book sack it's not that pretty I think it looks ugly I'd rather have my red Gap book sack People at ORGNAME don't seem to care about clothes but maybe Asians care about clothes Hmmm Enok seems really soft but hard, he's like a tough guy but not and I'm ugh what's wrong with that boy. Man it just seems like all he ever does is play on his stupid computer and he's getting mean now. He was really mean when I asked him about the fire drill the other day because he's probably fake like that like PROPNAME Gosh PROPNAME annoys the crap out of me I hope he doesn't come to UT because that would just be horrible. But knowing my luck he's going to come to UT and that would just be great PROPNAME's a pretty good roommate but I think he might be getting annoyed with me or something because I sleep later than he does and I think I talk more than he does something is wrong with him too because he never talks now I look at him differently for some strange reason and I want to be a bad kid again rather than the 'good' Christian boy I used to be I want a tattoo and I want some piercings hmmm that would be cool and my classes are okay but I have this guilty feeing and I don't know why I don't know if my friends here are true or not, maybe it's better if I just keep to myself more because I have this bad feeling that I haven't really met someone that's truly there you know I mean Debra is nice and all but still I think she might be fake and Sing just uses me he looks like a damn alien it's so gross ahhh I have to wash my face in a few seconds after I'm done with this because I think I'm getting acne again and that would just be horrible I though asians weren't supposed to get acne. My god the guy next door finally turned off his music thank god!  
__label__label1 I always knew college was about being on your own and being independent. Maybe I have been so busy that I didn't realize I was completely on my own until I got sick. Being sick is just one of those things I have never had to accomplish on my own. I always had my mom to take me to the doctor and even after I could drive, I still loved her company. I also knew that she would get me my medicine and make sure I was taken good care of. Being away from my mom and that comfort zone was not very easy when I became sick. It has definitely shown me that I depend on other people a lot, especially my mom. If there is one thing I am looking forward to about college, it is growing as a person. I hope to become more independent and prepare myself for the future years ahead. I always went away to camp during the summer and spent six weeks in LOCNAME one summer but for some reason, being in college is a much different feeling. I want to be able to do things completely on my own without consulting others, like my parents. I think the greatest thing I need to conquer is decisionmaking. I have always been bad at making up my own mind without asking someone else if I am making the right decision. I hope being in college will teach me to make good decisions and become that independent person I want to become. Already being away from home has taught me so much about myself and how it feels to be distant from that comfort zone. Just like most things, I know it will only take time and patience. 
__label__label1 Personally I feel really stressed out. I am a freshman at a very big university. I hardly know anybody and I feel very depressed and lonely all by myself. I am really close to my family so it is very hard to be eight hours away from them. I know this is a new experience, but I am just simply not happy here right now. Many people tell me that I'll get used to it, but I wish the process of adjusting could be a lot faster. I feel as if I should just give up this great opportunity to be at a great university and just go back home. I don't want to let anybody down, for example my whole family. The pressure to do good in school and not give up is so intense. I want to do something with my life, but sometimes I just look for the easy way out. I didn't know that adjusting to college life would be so difficult. How am I supposed to keep up with all this work that is assigned to me. My time management and study skills have not kicked in yet. I miss my whole family back at home. All I can do is get stressed out, I need to find a way to just chill out. I'm worried about basically everything I can think of. I don't know if I'm going to pass my classes, can I manage much longer here by myself, and are people going to accept me for who I am. I'm just not ready for such a drastic change as this one. I have hardly any money left, and I have not even found a job yet. I really need some help to figure out what I am going to do. I really don't know what buses to take to get to certain places. I get really frustrated reading all sorts of maps. Many times I feel as if I'm not even smart enough to be at a great university like this one. I think that is what my problem is, I just don't give myself enough credit. My brother tells me to think positive and he believes that I will make it here. I can not wait to go back home and see my whole family again. I wish I could be a Senior with only one year to go. Though that is not the case because I am a freshman, with many more years to go. Then again what else better do I got to do than studying and working. I would simply waste time and my life doing nothing at all. I want to be successful in life and have a good paying job. I know that is the reason I am willing to study and work hard. Knowing that when all this is done a job will be open to me. Hopefully a good paying job to support all my dreams in life. I really do hope I can make it here at LOCNAME. Right now as a freshman I really need all the hope and desire to help me get through this year. Hopefully when this year is over I will be glad because I made it through all my classes. I know study groups would really help me right now. I really dislike reading, but I know I'll have to do a lot of reading as a college student. 
__label__label1 ahhhh. I can't take it anymore, living with PROPNAME. I seriously don't understand what we are. Well, actually I think I do but just won't admit it. We're friends with benefits, that's terrible. We sleep in the same bed every night, and we cuddle, I rub he's back every night before I go to bed, and then he turns over and I rub his chest and stomach, and every morning his arm is around me. But every time I go to bed I always remind myself to stay far away from him as possible on the bed. like I always try to have my back facing him, but sometimes I can't help especially since his place is always so cold. I feel terrible that denniele has to sleep on the floor, and sometimes yeah erik and I will do it when she's only a few feet away. The thing is erik and I are really good in bed, but its more than that. It's really hard to get over someone when you're living with them, I want to move on I really do, I just I still like PROPNAME. our relationship is really weird though, I mean he still has the picture of him and I out on his bed stand, and he'll do these cute little favors, why?! Why are men so difficult to understand? They want one thing, but do another, its like shit make your mind. They say we play games whatever. D and I just need to move out of there, but how can we when we can't even get approve for an apartment, we were suppose to move out like 0 weeks ago, but didn't get approve. It's really nice of PROPNAME, my exboyfriend to let us stay at his place. D still doesn't have a job, but she's going through all these problems, she's so depressed and I'm really glad she's finally seeking help for it. The position she's in must be really difficult especially with me and PROPNAME around. The other night, his exfiance called from LOCNAME I know it was her it had to be. Well, since I did read his mail, and she's trying to find him, and the girl in the photograph who's half naked in his drawer is his ex he just won't admit to me. Ahhh. he's an asshole, but I still want him, why because as much as we don't want to admit, girls like the asshole because it's much more exciting there's a chase. But when a good guy comes you don't want him, strange huh. Anyways, D and I just need to meet new people that's all, but where? Seriously, where do we find new guys, not 0th street that's the worse place to go to. Shit I know he's out there somewhere, I shouldn't even be worrying about this stuff, there's so much I'm going through, with school and work, all this pressure I don't know even I can handle it. I'm really afraid of what the future holds for me. I really miss my family I haven't been home since spring break and I haven't seen my family since June, it's terrible that I didn't even go home at all this summer, I guess the reason I stayed was because of PROPNAME. PROPNAME was my first boyfriend, but not my first sexual partner, I was raped. He's so adorable, ahhh! I still remember our first conversation and the first times we went out and dated, ahhh! Oh, goodness I saw PROPNAME last weekend, well he gained weight, and now has a girlfriend, good for him as long as he is happy then I am happy for him. I've always wanted to know what would have happened if I had told him how I felt about him. But then I met PROPNAME, so who knows. I am so behind in all my classes, I've barely read for anything which is terrible. I just can't study at home at all, I get so distracted with PROPNAME and D being there. I am so indebt right now, I owe all these institutions money. Because of my irresponsibility that's why. Oh well, I know everything will be okay. I feel so fat I'm 000, right now I want to be at least 000, agrrrr. patience I'll be there, I just haven't had the time though to go down to gregory to workout. It's really just my tummy that's big, I still can't believe I got my belly button pierced last week, heheheh. I'm working today and the next two days, I need to make some mad money. Whatever happens happens, right. I wonder how my papa is doing where is he, somewhere on the road probably. I hope my dad and my sister are talking to each other, it's really hard when you have two daughters and one is always and the other one barely talks to you. I hope my mother is okay, I'm sure she is. Oh anyways, D's parents oh I love them they have helped me so much and guided me through a lot. The last few nights have been really fun, sitting outside with D for hours and just talking we haven't done that in a long time. I guess living with PROPNAME though we have no privacy what so ever, she doesn't either. I hope she finds someone good, she's good person who deserves someone that will treat her right. OH and her brother deserves someone good as well, goodness I had the biggest crush over him this summer and PROPNAME, too again. I saw PROPNAME the other day, still so cute. But he's just so good, he doesn't deserve someone like me, trust me. What's up with PROPNAME, I miss her I haven't spoken to her in like a month, how is she doing medically. HMmm! I really need to go home to LOCNAME and visit everyone I actually need a break from LOCNAME, I think I guess I'm just afraid to leave D and PROPNAME alone in the apt. , its so sad that I don't even trust them together. I know I don't I've never trusted PROPNAME, and I don't think he ever trusted me from the beginning and maybe that's why our relationship didn't work. He knew that I used to have feelings for PROPNAME, and yet I hung out with the dude probably more than I did with PROPNAME this summer. hmmm like I said I need to find fresh meat. ehehehe 
__label__label0 What is my problem? I have got to be the biggest bum on the planet. Does that mean I have some kind of psychoanalytical problem? I don't know about complexes and childhood mistakes but I do know that there is really something disturbingly lazy about my attitude towards things. What kind of person could put his entire future on the line by not taking care of his college responsibilities? I am that kind of person. I'll probably drop out of college or something and what's even worse is that I see the problem staring me right in my face but I am either to lazy or to apathetic to change my situation. Maybe I am a combination of both. Honestly, what will my parents say? Well, my Dad will probably be relieved that I came back home to him. Not in the way most families would be relieved though. He would just have another speech to hang over my head after every other mistake I may make in the future. He will probably totally dominate on me like he used to back in the day. He literally did not care about how you felt. Maybe that is not quite accurate. I am convinced that he cared about people, and he cared about the family structure as a whole, however his total control over everyone in the house was clear and unbinding. He probably would have defended us with his life, I am sure of it. It is ironic; he would die for us but he wouldn't compromise with us to save his life. Compromise? Never! God forbid! I know it cannot be that hard to prioritize. Wait a minute. How funny is that? I of all people have no business trying to tell someone to prioritize especially when it will be a God sent miracle if I turn in all my assignments this semester. But maybe, just maybe I have stumbled on to something here. I mean, well, what is the point I am trying to make? Maybe I recognize similarities between my persona and the people I have associated myself with over the years. Duh that's a no brainer. But it is interesting the way one can tell. With my friends it is very, very easy to see that we all talk and act and think alike. Sometimes we deliberately change ourselves to fit the mold. With people you dislike it is very different though isn't it? It seems that what we see in them we hardly see at all. I can feel, if almost by instinct, that he and I have some very serious related issues, however one doesn't just stumble over them in his summation of the days events. A person has to be writing on a day very much like today, working on an assignment, very much like this one, following his "stream of consciousness. " Whatever that means is almost beside the point as far as I am concerned. Maybe this is like a journal or something. Maybe I should start writing a journal or something. I can be like "Captain PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME" writing his "captains log. " Wow. How did I get so off track? All I know is that I started this thing at twelve sixteenpm which means that in another minute I will be able to stop writing about my pitiful mental concepts. I'll probably drop off in mid sentence or something 
__label__label1 I've decided to write this stream of consciousness paper on laptop going home to LOCNAME. My brother was doing the driving so I decided to use my time wisely and write. Right now I feel relaxed going home. I still call LOCNAME my home, although for the second year in a row I've spent 0 months of the year in LOCNAME. I wonder if I'll ever call LOCNAME home. Maybe only if I live here when I'm more settled in my life. What's weird is that though I am going to college with a goal, and doing reasonably well and taking courses that I myself have chosen, I still can't but help feel at time that I'm not sure where I'm going. Or if I will reach these goals. I wonder if others feel the same way. I'm quite sure they do which is probably why when the weekend rolls around six packs are brought in. I, myself, have never drank, so maybe that's why I feel that I am taking the whole impact of this college thing, so much more than others. I kind of figured out why college students feel so pressured in college and I've came up with several reasons. First, you have to study like hell to do well. Second, sometimes you can study and not do as well as you expect. Third no folks around to cry on their shoulder and then you can't because you're a so called wuss if you do. Fourth there's no tangible evidence like money to make you feel like you're going to succeed. By the time a kid reaches college level he or she wants the financial freedom of an adult but knows it way down the road. Sometimes that road seems too foggy to see down. Finally if your a momma or daddy's boy you miss that home cooking. With all that dry and dull food and on top of that mounds of homework and hours of studying to do any right person would not call Austin their home. Not just yet. We all need a safe haven to go to. Mine is in LOCNAME. 
__label__label1 Well, all that is on my mind sure cannot be summed up in twenty minutes, but I will continually type for that time. Lately I have desired to do nothing but become closer to God. He is awesome. My freshman year of high school was great all because I had God on my side. Now I feel like I have lost him. I know He is still there for me, but I have damaged that relationship that we had. I chose to live my life and not listen to Him. It hurts because life was stressfree and I always knew that God was just right there waiting for me everywhere I went. When I would walk outside I would smile and greet God with open arms. Now I feel like sometimes I look negatively upon the weather and don't even think of the great God who made everything. I have been trying to become closer to God. I read in the Bible more often. Rather than praying for myself or for God to do great works in my life, I now ask God what I can do to better the lives of others. I think that my outlook on life will change once I fully begin to ask Him what He wants of me rather than demanding Him to help me. I think once my relationship with Him improves, my money worries will go away. One worry is about transferring out of the school of business. I could transfer out of the business school, but I am afraid of what my future holds. I know with a business degree at ORGNAME jobs will be flying at me from every direction. Instead of being a cutthroat businesswoman, I want to help society. If I would get paid a good amount, I would definitely help the homeless or disabled. That attitude is wrong. God does not want me to think like that. He wants me to trust that He will provide all my financial necessities. He wants me to pray to Him to find out what I need to do in life. He will give me meaning once I am fully ready to accept His answer. I continually pray to God asking Him what I am to do with my life. He has not told me. I do not think it is that He has not told me; I think He has told me to wait for the right time for him to tell me. I know He will let me know when He feels I am ready to accept the task He has prepared for me. Right now I long to know what that task is. As I read the Bible daily and pray to Him daily, I feel I am taking one step closer to receiving a better understanding of my life and knowing what I am destined to do. I cannot wait until God shows me the way to my career, my husband, my kids, my destiny, but I always have to remember what my mom says. God and her both agree: patience is a virtue and in order to obtain these goals, I need to be patient. 
__label__label1 Ok, I am starting writing for 00 min. My thought, are what I am writing about. Right now I am still thinking about visiting my friends at LOCNAME this weekend, not sure If I want to do that. I have stuff to do, got to get a new id, and eat, and some other stuff, mainly thinking about what I have to do. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend is why I am thinking about visiting ORGNAME. I have to be back at 0 Sunday to try out for ransom notes, so that is a factor, Also PROPNAME wanted me to visit EV free Sunday morning with her, so if I do that I will want to leave Saturday afternoon, so I am not sure, I still need to read chapters in psy, chapters 0,0 in CS, chapter 0 in psy, I need to do that today, maybe after I go run, I think I will go to ORGNAME tonight and come back tomorrow afternoon. And get stuff done, I need to work on that song, that reminds me I need to go get those Birkenstocks as well, anyway I want to see PROPNAME and PROPNAME and the game but I don't know if I will have much time, maybe I can leave in the morning tomorrow, and skip the game, come home and do some stuff, that will give me time to go and get the shorts and sandals I have been meaning to get, then I can still go out on sat night, maybe with PROPNAME or PROPNAME, most everyone went back to see PROPNAME, I wish I was seeing PROPNAME, but they sold out the first weekend they were on sale and I was not in town to get them. Oh well, I can get more stuff done now,. need to sunin my hair and go running,. remember to get exenphrime, exandrine or whatever ant ORGNAME on Tuesday, I may go run then work out a while today I want to figure out what I am doing tonight first though. PROPNAME said something about a dance tonight, but he is dateless. So I am not sure, hmmm, what to do what to do, I need to work out defiantly this weekend. Hmmm, I wish I could see everyone, but all my friends go to diff colleges, PROPNAME keeps asking me to come visit her, which I should do but I am lazy, hah, I have no time for anything anymore, I squeeze in homework and studying, I need to do something about that, I would like to see PROPNAME though, I kind of miss her, it is a lot harder than I thought it would be to meet girls here, they are either intimidating or not worth the trouble, I guess I have just had bad luck but every single good looking girl I have started conversations with has a boyfriend, but none of them have really been good looking enough to make it worth my time to try and become better friends with them if they are in a relationship, PROPNAME was pretty cool, but now things are weird between us, I need to get will and ryan to take me to some fiji parties, those will probably be better. I guess I will skip workout today and just go up at about 0:00 hmm, writing this didn't seem like the chore I thought would be. I just have weekend plans on my mind so I can't think of much else. Psy is fun, I need to be a little less tired Monday so I can enjoy it, I will work on that. Over and out. 
__label__label1 Wheres my bank literature. I don't know? I need to call PROPNAME. I wonder if she cheated one me. I think she did, oh well, in some ways, but I love her. This paper is orange; it looks cool. My dad is here, he's been drinking. We went to hooters. The girls there were completely the finest creature walking on the face of the earth lol. I had so much fun last night. I went to keg Thursday at our pool, then to a party. I met PROPNAME, we went to a sorority crush party on sixth street at the LOCNAME club. It was so wild, I met sooo many girls, hell girls were all over me it was the greatest thing in the world. I kissed a lot of girls, may have gotten a possible girlfriend, the phone just rang, it was bridgette, she lives in illinois. My dad is watching the drew carey show and setting on my bed drinking on of my beers! he better by me more. PROPNAME. I love her, but I don't know if I want that to be apart of my life because it brings much stress, PROPNAME is a dumbass, now I'm talking to my dad at the same time. PROPNAME was on letterman doing the top ten list. But if I go the other route and try my luck in relationship out with either karen or kareth I have a feeling my life is going to be much better now but maybe not in the future. So I'm torn between love and having a possibly better present life. What do I do???? Oh well, now I'm thinking of this assignment. This just might be the best or most fun assignment I have ever done. It says, you can be yourself, my psychology class is my most favorite class. Its really the only one that actually interests me. I missed class though the other day because our water was cut off and I hadn't taken a shower; that's the second time the water has been cut off here at melrose. It throws such a big dagger into any plans you have. You don't realize how water is such a big part of your life until its taken away. and it almost leaves you not being able to function. I have eight more minutes left. I wonder how much everyone else typed. I figure for some reason I might be typing less who knows. Oh well its not like it has to be a certain length or anything. And plus I can't exactly type as fast as I think. I need help in calculus, I have done really bad on my first two quizzes and am going to look into getting a tutor next week. and before I leave this evening I NEED to sign up for some outlook thingy for email in the business school about setting up a bus account. The girl I set with in class is really pretty, my dad just turned up the tv and is watching a sports show. Wow my stream of conscious is jumping around to everything I didn't realize I thought this much, but this even isn't the half of it because I'm thinking so much more than I can type. I met a ORGNAME football player last night, he was really cool. I miss playing football. I'm going to UMHB tonight to party with a few of my friends back from high school. I'm going home this weekend for the first time since I've been here. My clothes are washing. I wish my dad would turn the tv down. I have so many girls phone numbers all over the place from girls, I should really think about organizing that stuff or I'm going to loss them. I hate people who do drugs, so many people don't know how too party right and when enough is enough. Oh did I mention lol I love girls hehe. Wow, they are awesome!. I love to dance, PROPNAME PROPNAME isn't going to play this week. I set my time on my clock, since the power went out this morning. I use ORGNAME's time by which to set mine. I like watching comedy central, we didn't have it back at home. My computer messed up yesterday. and with that I'm spent! :) 
__label__label0 After I finish this paper I'm going to go work out, then get something to eat at LOCNAME LOCNAME. I need to get back in shape. I feel better. Then I'll finish reading from my Zen book and economics book. I hope I am not taking the same economics class I did last year at CCCC. That is going to be a big waste if it is. I can't wait to go home on Friday to see my friends and family. It's not all what is cracked up to be down here. LOCNAME is so much better. It bigger, better stuff to do. I just like that environment. It's ok down here. I really have not met many people. Just my roommate and a few in my dorm. Oh yeah, I almost forgot that I met a very friendly and pretty girl named PROPNAME today. She lives in 000 of the Towers. She told me to come by. I'm debating on going over there or not. I'm sure PROPNAME wouldn't like it. Obviously since we are not doing so good right now. I just don't know what to do with her. I feel like if I break up with her it is going to be a mistake. I don't know what I feel. I'm lost. I don't feel like I have the freedom to do what I want to do. Sometimes I just feel like I'm better of with out her. She would be crushed if I broke up with her since it would be like the 00th time. I feel like there is just something else out there better for me, but I never tell her that. The sight of seeing her hurt and crying makes me feel so guilty and sad. I feel so sorry for her. I lie to her all the time about my true feelings because they are so mixed right now. I feel like I'll be lost with out her, but that might be just because I was with her for so long. I am getting pretty hungry right now, but I need to work out first. There are a lot of fine girls that work out. Sometimes I wish I could hook up with one of them. Tomorrow night might be fun. I only have one class, thank god. I hate Tuesday's and Thursday's. Three classes from 000 is forever. Actually I just hate my Cal class. I can't stand sitting in those chairs they are so uncomfortable. Just two more days until I leave. I 'm getting pretty anxious about it. I can't sleep very much at night. I don't fall asleep until 0 or 0. Then I wake up very tired. I can't wait to back to sleep after classes. But then I feel like I'm pressured for time. If I sleep it takes away the time I have to study, therefore taking away my free time. So its either nap, or play. I hope my tests aren't difficult at least after I have studied well. I have this horrible fear that I am not going to do good and fail out. That is the last thing I want to happen. 
__label__label0 This assignment seemed so easy at first, but now that I am actually writing it, it is hard to find something to write about. I thought that would spend a little time telling you about my first few days at The ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I come from a very small town, and all my life I have dreamed of living in a very big city. So around my junior year in high school I began looking at different schools and one of them happen to be here. Well I have been to Austin before, but I never got to really go on campus. As I stood on the south mall and saw the capital, I knew this was the place for me. I had a big city and a big school all rolled into one. As the big day got closer and closer, I began to chicken out. I didn't want to leave home, but most of all, I didn't want to leave my family. I wasn't for sure that I could move six hours away not knowing one single person. Everyone told me that I would never make it on my own because I was too much of a "mommy's girl. " This is when I knew that it was time to grow up and take another big step in my life. The "moving day" finally arrived and I was scared, but very excited. I decided to go through rush. I needed some kind of activity to keep me busy and this was perfect. My family got me settled in and two days later they were gone. I was very surprised that I didn't shed a tear that day, and two weeks later I still haven't looked back. I haven't even been homesick yet. My roommate is having a hard time, though. We didn't get along at first, but I think everything will work out fine. She calls home a lot crying, and sometimes that is kind of hard on me, but I hope to help her through this tough time. Other than a few small bumps in my road, I am having the time of my life. I will admit all of this is a huge change for me, but sometimes change is just what a person needs. Somehow, everything has just fallen in place for me, and I hope it will remain this good for the next 0 years. 
__label__label0      I really don't know what to write about. It is funny when you try to think about what you are thinking about and you can't seem to find anything in your head. My friend is talking to his girlfriend. Typing is a lot harder than I remember. September 00th is coming up and I hear patriotic music in the background. My drive back to LOCNAME today was very hard. It rained the whole way down here so instead ORGNAME the usual three hour drive it turned into nearly four hours. My band practiced very well this weekend. We put in about four hours of practice. Our show this weekend was cancelled so instead we decided to practice. We did a little recording in my guitar player's garage. I stayed up very late yesterday just talking to some friends online. I had a huge burrito from Chipolte. I had never been there before so it was a surprise to see a burrito that big; however, I didn't really enjoy it because they put onions and peppers in it. I suppose it was my fault, because I told them what to put in it. I said I wanted fajita chicken and then started putting peppers and onions in the burrito. I thought the fajita part was the way the cooked the chicken. It turns out it was just the stuff they put in with the chicken. I didn't eat much of it, but I will still give the place a second chance. Now I know not to order that kind of burrito. My parents took my girlfriend and her friend out to dinner on friday night. We went to chili's off of F. M. 0000. After that we went to my girlfriend's house and just played the piano. We played for about two hours. I figured out how to play two new songs. One was a spanish song and the other was carol of the bells. We had no music, we were just going by ear. My girlfriend's friend was getting very annoyed because she did not want to play the piano. Instead she played cards with my girlfriend's family. Studying for college has not been going the way I would like it. I told myself I would stay caught up with all of my classes, but I seem to have fallen behind already with all of them. I just need to concentrate and read like a mad man. PROPNAME PROPNAME keeps running through my ears and I can't get the lyrics from entering.   How can I turn away. Brother sister go dancing.   I went to two of his concerts this year. They were a blast. There were so many fans yelling and screaming. The atmosphere was so pleasant. He played a few of my favorite songs and I nearly cried. The ORGNAME of ORGNAME football game was very interesting. They almost lost. I was so excited with two minutes left in the game and LOCNAME trailing LOCNAME by three points. Unfortunately ORGNAME won. They also, unfortunately lost their quarterback with a torn ACL. LOCNAME got off to a bad start although they managed to keep the ORGNAME from scoring. It looked like the UT offense was about to fall apart in the second half. Next week should be a thriller in LOCNAME LOCNAME. ORGNAME will be on nonstop in my dorm room. My mom is calling. She wanted to make sure I got home safely. I am glad to be here with most of friends although I do have friends that are not with me. My girlfriend for one is back in dallas and every chance I get I go back and see her. I wish she was here with me and then it wouldnt be so hard and I wouldn't waste as much gas. Twenty minutes has ended.  
__label__label0      The first thing that comes to mind is that when I do these things I don't know what to write. I just sit trying to think of things to write. This to me is like one of those awkward situations like when you are with someone you don't know and have to make small talk. This is like tring to think of something to say to that person the only thing is, is that your the only person here trying to think of something to say to the computer. Another thought popped into my head and that is that I don't know what to do in my speech class. I have to give an interview to someone and be interviewed by someone and I have no idea on what I want to do with that. I had an idea and the professor was going down the list of names asking us what we were going to do ours on and I had an idea and the girl before me took my idea so now I am left here with no thoughts on what to do in this situation. I will just have to go on and think of something else to do on this project, athough I am not to really worried about it. I wonder if while doing this writing experiment that the reader ever takes into consideration that some people might have periods where they just don't think about basicly anything. That they are just in a daze where no clear thought comes into their mind and they have absolutely nothing to talk about. I was just wandering. Now a song that I hate has just come on that I heard for the first time while I was visiting for the first time that part the family that you don't talk about because they are imberasing. I don't think I spelled that word right, but anyway it was in LOCNAME and I don't plan on ever going back there again. Now another song I hate has come on but I am in a delimma because of this contineous writing thing I can move my fingers to change the station. I now looked up at the clock seeing that I only have three minutes left and this is not as hard as I thought it was going to be, but my essay has been pretty boring because I am tired and had nothing to talk about. The reason I am so tired is because I have an eighto o' clock clase everyday and it really, really sucks. Well, I only have 0 seconds left and actually I would like to talk for a longer period of time but I guess I will talk to myself on paper where you can read at a later time, bye. 
__label__label1 This is the second paper I have written like this because somehow the other one disappeared right when I was trying to push the   Finish   button. It seems like my life is always going the wrong way or I have bad luck such as this for most of the time. I did just get through working out with my   Tae-bo   tape. After completing that I always feel 000% better about myself and problems. I guess you could say that is how I deal with all of my stress,even though my life is not all that bad. Whenever someone thinks their life is terrible I always think about those children that you see on television that are starving or sick. I don't know why but I whenever I see a homeless person on the street I immediately feel sorry for them but then I start to think about why they don't have a job or are not in a shelter. My mind goes back and fourth like that a lot. LOCNAME has a lot of homeless and I am so not used to that atmosphere, that is partly why I don't like living here. And because my boyfriend wants me to come back closer to where he lives which is LOCNAME, where I live as well. I chose LOCNAME and UT because a lot of people told me that I should not go here, including my boyfriend. That just made me want to come even more though, dispite the fact that I could tell at orientation that I was not going to like it. My boyfriend is very important to me though because I have dated him for 0 years and we have a really special relationship. I can tell just by looking at him exactly what he is thinking about. I have never really had that with anyone before and he always tells me that he loves me. I find this kind of annoying because in my family I don't think that my mom or dad have ever told me those three words. My grandmother has but I used to just say it not even thinking about what it really meant. I guess that is why whenever he tells me that repeatably it starts to get on my nerves. Hopefully I don't have love issues or something of that nature because don't get me wrong I truly know that my parents love me but they just never told me. I have had a good life so I really don't need to complain about small things. I am in a very difficult spot in my life, college is a lot harder than most people say. I mean I expected the classes to be difficult and challenging but not the living on your own part. I was always so ready to get away from my house and away from the town that I lived in. Now I am not so sure about this because I don't really like Austin. I believe that I would have been better at a smaller school but I never really thought about those issues when I was selecting a college. I was too busy talking to or seeing my boyfriend or worrying about stupid high school bull that goes on everyday. I should have not cared where my best friend went to school, even though she was supposed to come here with me and then suddenly changed her mind without telling me. I am not resentful or anything but I feel that it is partly her fault, no it's not it is all my fault. I am the one who chose my future and now I want to change those plans. I guess I should be greatful that my roommate is not some freak with earrings and tattoos all over her body. I always think that things can always get worse and if you're lucky they sometimes get better. At least I did not get stuck in the same room as my suite mates because they are kind of snobbish. For instance, if I see them outside of our dorm then I have to say hi and if I don't they pretend they don't know me. I don't understand why people are like that but who am I to make a judgement, for all I know they are really sincere and nice people. I talk about people way too much but if you do it for so long it just comes natural and you can't stop. My room is actually really comfortable right now, usually it is either way hot or real cold.         
__label__label1 I am so excited that I get to see my family this weekend. I never thought I would feel so home sick at college. I love my mother so much she has been through hell and back and still remains such a wonderful Christian mother. If I am half the mother she is to me when I have children I know I will be doing a great job. I am also really nervous about this presentation I have to do on Monday for my Media Studies class. Not only do I not know what to write about but I don't know how to prepare for it. Of course I got there late for my discussion group  so I got the bottom of the barrell when signing up for a presentation topic and the only one left was for Monday. But that is so my luck. It makes me think that if I am nervous about giving this in front of my discussion group of maybe twenty people how am I going to make it in the communications field which is what I am majoring in at this point. I really want to work for ORGNAME. I know many people must think of this as a childish fantasy, but it is really something I am serious about and want to persue. I just love everything about music. The artists there story, the songs story, and how they make people fell. I can't wait till I am done typing this because then I get to go play PROPNAME with my roomate and a couple of our friends from back home. I am such a competitive person which to me is a good thing because it makes me have more determination then most people. I am watching Will and Grace and they are talking about having a baby. Gosh I can't wait till that day. I think I must have orange cones around me though and a flashing message that tells guys don't talk to her!  I swear they avoid me at all costs. What the heck is wrong with me. I think I might be a little intimidating because I don't play the role of a dumb girl who needs a guy to take care of her. Which I think I got that from my mother. She is a single mom, my father died when I was ten, who is a teacher and had to raise three children all by herself. She didn't need help from anyone and she never threw in the towel when times got hard. For that I respect and love her very much. God has blessed me with the best family I could have ever imaged. Not only my imidate family but everyone from my grandparents to aunts and uncles to cousins. All of them have played such an important part of my life and have thought me so much that I just want to go and hug all of them and say thanks for loving me it has given such strength. My grandparents are so great because they can always make me feel like a million bucks even when I am at my lowest. I think it is important to surround yourself with a close knit family. I don't know what I would do without mine. I am so glad I have my roomate and friends from back home here at LOCNAME. I probably won't have latest this long without them and there company. They all have such interesting stories that I had never know about them before. Most of my school went to LOCNAME a and m which is exactly like my hometown. We all just needed something different and a place with a good sports team 
__label__label1      I know I said that I was ready to write but PROPNAME not too sure exactly what I need to be doing. I hope this is right. Great now PROPNAME worrying. I worry way too much that is a problem of mine. I always seem to worry even if there is no reason for it I even worry about other people's problems. I wish I could just be laid back sometimes like my best friend PROPNAME. He's also my roommate. Now Im now sure if this is right because Im telling you about myself when Im just supposed to be thinking. Okay now Im thinking. Why is my room so hot. Sometimes its not hot but right now Im boiling. I think it is because I am nervous about this assignment. Theres no reason to be I just need to type. Well here I am typing. My room smells funny right now. PROPNAME bought some cinna sticks from Dominoes a while back and I think that they are going bvad. I know they are going bad. I need to take out the trash than. I hate that I get lazy and don't take out the trash because it makes me feel and llok like a slob. Great now I propbably sound all anal about mess when Im not at all like that. Well im not a messy person but you know. Gosh reading over this I sound like such a pessimist and so boring. Oh well. Time sure is going by pretty slow. I want to make jell-o but I don't think I have room in fridge for it. Gosh some lime jell-o would be pretty good right now. I wonder how jell-o becomes jell-o . Like how does it form the way it does? Whats in gelatin to make it stiffen up and turn into jell-o. One day Im going to find out. More than likely I won't do it but it seems reassuring to tell myself that Im gooing to look into it. It makes me feel productive. Im worried about my financial situation right now. I still have almost 0000 to pay off and I got a loan for that and all but I don't know where that money is or who I need to talk to in order to get my hands on it. Tomorrow I guess Ill just need to go to the ssb and talk to someone about that. I can't think of anything else right now. I feel like Im just waisting time typing nothjing but if this ios what was wanted than who am I to say no. This should be an easy   a   or at least I hope. I hope the instructor doesnt read this and just because I said easy A then Im going to get like a   b   or something. Just in case Im sorry even if this seems easy I do my work and I dedicate time so when it comes down to it, I think I deserve that   a  . Great Im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment. I wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance? I doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up. But then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them. Ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient. Is lenient even a word? Oh well anyhow the teacher, her name was Ms. PROPNAME, she scored perfect on her SAT's. How the heck did she ever pull that off. And since she did I have no idea why shes teaching at LOCNAME. In case you dopnt know which you probably don't ORGNAME is a public inner-city school in LOCNAME LOCNAME and it does not have the best of reputations. I hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to? And that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond   PROPNAME  . Esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from LOCNAME. Well thats their loss because Im a great person to know and I don't fit the   Edison   stereotype. There should be no stereotypes. They are just not fair. Hey cool ranting on and on made the time go by fast and its almost up. just 00 more seconds. 00 now. Wow this is actually good stress relief I should do this more often when I have time. 
__label__label1      This is my first writing assignment of college. It doesn't seem like it could be so bad. In fact, college itself isn't so bad yet. Its not like i have any homework that is assigned. All my friends have homework constatnly that is due for them to turn in. Glad i am not in that situation. I guess that I am behind in schoolwork though. I need to read so many chapters in so many books. But who wants to read when I could be going out. The freedom here is wonderful. I don't think I have stayed out this late so many days in a row ever. It's amazing to me how much fun something as stupid sounding as an   00's theme   fraternity party could be. Fraternity parties are the best thing here i think. Free alcohol, no way to get caught under 00 (unless you are stupid), and guys everywhere. Of course, I have already skipped class because of hangovers. Or can you really call them hangovers if you are still intoxicated. I am not sure about that one. I have already met so many guys. I wish that i wasn't the way I am about guys. I wish I could just meet them and enjoy our time and then thats it. No, there is always one that i seem to get attatched to. I don't want to like anyone though. I am having to fight my usual ways to keep from liking just this one guy. I promised myself i wouldn't fall for someone for at least a year. I am sick and tired of being controlled by men. Boyfriends are always controlling and now that I don't want a boyfriend I am still being controlled by having to fight feelings of attatchment. Don't they say that you seek people similar to your father subconsciously?  That would make sense i suppose. He is controlling too. Not in a bad way- or in an abusive way. I suppose I would call it more of a   traditional   way. He is the head of the household, the   king  ,  and its normally his way or the highway. Even though I always got the last word when i lived at home. That got me in more trouble sometimes than what we were fighting about. Oh well, now we are perfect. I have always been Daddy's Little Girl and now he misses me to much to pick fights with me. I miss him too though. I call him almost every day at home or at work. I don't really miss my mom though. She is still bitter about my pledging AChiO, rather than her precious ADPi.   I'm a triple legacy, why would i want to go anywhere else?    I will tell you why, because those girls are NOT FOR ME!!!  I miss my dog most of all. My   PROPNAME girl   is so sad without me according to my sister. She said she doesn't play anymore, she won't lay on anyones lap- which she used to do all the time- and she just seems sad. I always knew I was her favorite. I hope I am writing about what I am supposed to be. The assignment did say to write what you were thinking about. And as I started writing all of this is just coming out of my head. The best thing about this assignment is that it seems to go by fast. I suppose i have a lot of things on my mind. There are a lot of things I would like to settle so they could be out of my mind. Like the money issue. I am so sick of money. I just balanced my checkbook and i don't have any. And basically that sucks. When all my friends just whip out Daddy's credit card for plane tickets to L. A. for the weekend and 0000 dollar TV's for their dorm, and a new outfit for every party or event, and good food at good restaurants, and basically everything else- it sucks to not be able to do that. My parents support me and i am very grateful for what i get, but the other way would be nice too. I respect my parents for how hard they work to support me. They don't want me to work and i know that I am expensive. College tuition, living/eating expenses, sorority dues, car payment, insurance, and everything else they pay for gets expensive. I just wish i could do more. I guess i am selfish for not getting a job even if they don't want me too. I say i want to help, but if i worked i would hate it and i would complain, and i would just want to go out all the time. I hope that grammer and punctuation, etc. doesn't count in this paper. I hate capitalizing   I   when i type fast. I am almost done. Done! 
__label__label1 The timer is already on 00 seconds and I was thinking what to write. I am waiting for my boyfriend PROPNAME to call me because we just talked and he beeped over and said he'd call back. The fan in my room is seriously getting on my nerves because I stripped something in it and it makes a funny vibrating noise. I guess I am nervous about writing this because my foot will not stop tapping. I am so tired. I do not want to go to my Nutrition class today. It's the same thing every day and it lasts for an hour and a half. I have so much homework to do also. I just found out that my e-mail in the UT Directory is wrong and I have no idea who to contact to change that either. My eyes are drooping so bad. I have so much to do today and just not enough time. I need to finish all my homework, go to class, go to the gym, take a shower before class, and after I go to the gym, and then read a book for my classical mythology class. I'm looking at the timer now and it is only on 0 minutes and 00 seconds. It feels like I've been writing for a lot longer already. I guess I should be lucky to even be on the Internet. My dorm, (PROPNAME), has had a lot of problems with Ethernet, and this morning (for the second time) when I awoke, my Internet would not work. It really sucked. My room is so dirty and I need to clean it. I hate making my bed and waking up to start another long day. My stomach hurts because I ate too much at lunch. The food wasn't really that great today either. I shouldn't have eaten any ice cream. I need to start eating a lot healthier than I have been. I feel bad that I have been cheating on my diet. It was a protein/no carbs diet and at first I did well, but lately I've been cheating. I need to go to ORGNAME today to buy a friend of mine a wedding present. I can't beleive she's getting married. I'll probably be the last of my friends to get married. Three of the 0 of us are already married. My eyes are soooo tired. I just want to crawl back in bed. I really really wish today were Friday. I can't even imagine what next week will be like. after all, the past two weeks have been short weeks. Next week is our first full week. I am so ready for this weekend. I am going home and sleeping in my own bed finally. The phone is ringing. It is my boyfriend, PROPNAME. I'm explaining to him that I have to get off the phone because I am doing this assignment. Okay he is gone now. I told him to call me back in ten minutes and he said he'd call me back in a little while. that means by the time he calls I'll probably be in my 0:00 class. Sometimes he gets on my nerves so bad, but I love him so much. I just feel like he doesn't hardly ever have time for me. It's even harder now that I'm in school. We hardly have time to talk because he's at work from six a. m. to 0 p. m. and I don't get out of class m-f until 0 p. m. By that time both of us have to eat dinner, and I have homework or he has errands to run. sometimes he comes and sees me or I go see him. PROPNAME isn't really that far. But it is an annoying drive. This summer we're supposed to move in together. I almost wonder if we'll still be together then. It makes me sad to even think about us breaking up. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me and I've never been happier. I've also never been sadder sometimes. I guess that's just part of being in an adult relationship. If we live together this summer, we're going to live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I wish we could live in LOCNAME, but he would have to drive to LOCNAME LOCNAME every day. Oh well. I still have six minutes left to type. I need to call my mom today and see how my family is doing. They came up to see me on Sunday, but didn't get to stay long. It really is amazing how our relationship has changed. They finally respect me and give me my own space. Before, me and my parents argued ALL the time. Now we actually have phone conversations without even saying one cross word. it's pretty nice. I know it's just because they miss me though. The lights in my room are so annoying. the ones that came affixed to the walls are bright harsh florescent lights. the other ones we bought are sooo bright they hurt my eyes. I guess I'm not going to get to work out today. It's already 00:00 and I still have a lot to do before my three thirty class. I wonder what you guys are going to learn from all this babbling of mine?  To me, I wouldn't see anything interesting about a bunch of kids rambling on about their thoughts. Damn my typing needs work. I used to be a great typist, now I have to backspace a million times to get it right. It's terribly annoying. I think after I'm done with this I might sign up for my experiments for this class. I did the pretest the other day. it took way longer than I expected. My arms and hands are getting tired of typing. I can't wait until this is over. only 00 more seconds. that fan is still making that stupid noise, and my suitemate just got home. She always slams the door. I really need to clean my room and I guess I will in about 0 seconds. Okay well bye for now. I'm not going to finish my writing now that my 00 min. are up. I've got lots of other things to do today. bye 
__label__label0 When I first heard about our first writing assignment, I figured it would be very difficult because I am used to writing about a specified subject matter. But hopefully I can take up these 00 minutes by talking my day or how I feel. Actually, I think I'd like to start out by expressing my thoughts about the pre-testing we were required to do. It was amazing at how some of the questions completely reflected me or something that I might feel or think. I also learned a little about myself, my self-esteem, and my self-confidence. Well, I don't have much of either (self-esteem/ self-confidence). Hopefully, by living by myself and taking care of things here in LOCNAME I will develop these traits. When I first came to college, it was very terrifying because all my life my family and friends have always been with me and even taken care of things for. I almost had no experience about 'living on my own' and 'taking care of myself. ' I mean, I knew how to do my laundry and the essentials, but when it came to asking others questions or figuring stuff on my own, I was not able to do it. For example, I hadn't even ordered pizza by myself! So I naturally hesitated to call up the pizza guy because I wasn't sure of what sizes or deals they had. But I quickly learned here, that YOU have to take initiative and most importantly, no question is stupid. In fact, the question I probably ask, someone else might benefit from it. So I think I have grown a great deal in that aspect while here in college. In addition, I would always do everything with my friends. And upon coming to PROPNAME, I feel/felt very lonely because all my close friends have gone to other colleges. Usually, I'm not very extroverted and won't 'go out of my way' to find a friend. So these past few weeks, I did not let myself do that. I very bravely went up to random people and made pretty good friends with them. This was very rewarding, in that, I don't feel as lost in such a big university, and I'm greatly improving my interpersonal skills. This is a characteristic which I will need for my expected major. I'm still not too keen on what exactly I want to do because when I think about it, I want to do/be everything, but when I think about it again I don't want to do a single think, and be totally carefree! But I think I'll try to keep up my original enthusiasm. I'm thinking about business or communications--at least it's narrowed down THAT much. But I still keep changing my mind in these two subjects. I don't know if I should blindly follow my dad's advice or at least try to see what interests me. Because architecture originally interested me, but my dad would know better and told me not to do that. So I'm really confused about that. Hopefully, I will learn more about myself through my college journey at LOCNAME.

__label__label0 I've never really thought about what I'm thinking before, there seems to be someone in the net room making alot of racket. That's OK though because this is a dorm. They are talking now, wait I can't here them anymore, wait they just started talking again. I wonder what they are talkig about, probably something unimportant. I really need to find out where the Fine Arts library is so I can do this gay reading list. I don't even have a clear understanding of what I'm supposed to do. I assume I just have to look at some art and write down my feelings about it or something. It is really annoying becuase the class is already 0 hours long. There should not be any outside work, but I guess it's not too hard, and if there are not any set boundaries there isn't any set grading material, this means that it is basically completion, much like this assignment. I really want to go to the Texas Ski Ranch tommorrow but I can't find anyone to go and it is like an hour away and it will probably take longer because of traffic because the only time I could leave would be around 0:00. I hope they have put up some pimp sliders and kickers out there. If anyone reads this and you wakeboard/wakeskate and you want to go ride behind a pimp ass ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and your willing to pay gas money contact me. Because I'm always looking for other riders and other people to pay gas money except myself. My roomate is sleeping right now. I can't decide if I like him or not. I don't dislike him, but I can't imagine myself being a really good friend of his. It seem our only link is that we are roomates. He seem like a little bit of a Jesus freak and a dork. That would suck if he was reading this right now, it's Ok, he's not. But you know how some people you just feel that you have a connection with them, that you can talk to them. You know that when your aroud them you feel comfortable. You can never tell that when you just look at a person. It seems to be the strangest people that are these people that you seem to share a special bond with, that you feel completly comfortable with. You feel you can be yourself, act stupid, laugh, you become a different person when you are around those people. I only noticed that fact this year. This year has been a real year of self examination and growth for me. I don't think I have grown as much as a thinking human being in this year then any other. I don't know what spurred it, but I think I know. I know I know. It was a girl I just got to know this year, but when I realized how important she was to me and how much I liked her she was taken. In my self pity I couldn't find the strength to tell her how I felt. I think I was scared of losing the friendship we already had. I didn't want our relationship to be strained by the possibility of me having feelings for her but the feelings not being mutual. I should have just told her and gotten it out in the open. She changed my life. I got the idea in my mind that to be with her I would need to be in the same physical shape as her to have any chance of a relatinship. She was the first motivation ever that pushed me to fulfill a long time goal of losing wieght and getting in shape. I still think about her and I know in my heart I will pursue her the next oppurtunity. The weight loss brings to mind another point that I have noticed about people. For as much talk that there is about inner beauty and all that shit, It's bullshit general (bulshi         
__label__label1 I just got up about twenty minutes ago and really thought that I should finish this assignment, I felt kind of embarrased the other day when the entire class had done theirs' and I was still sitting around without twenty minutes to spare. I really am kind of overwhelmed by the class and university in general, not that I've told anyone because that's just not how I deal with my problems. I scheduled my classes so that I have these breaks in between that I could presumably use to study, but I instead retire to my dorm room to eat macaroni and watch a movie. I watch too many movies in the first place (I'm a theater major, so it's basically study), but I haven't placed any amount of time into actual studying for classes like biology that I know I have trouble with. Between that and the massive theater program, it's just a bit too much. Here I am, now the tiny fish in the pond when I've spend the last four years on top of the game as far as acting was concerned. It's just a different place, different circumstances, and I just don't know where I fit in yet. I understand that I have to learn the ropes and pay my dues and then eventually I'll be on top (best case scenario anyway). But what will I do if this really isn't the path best meant for me? I really, honestly don't think I'd be able to survive in a desk job for the rest of my working life, and if I don't make it as an actor, chances are, that's exactly what I'll have to do. That prospect terrifies me even more than the class thing, or I guess goes along with it, because to even have a chance at success in the entertainment industry I have to have a broad range of intelligences not only within the field, but general knowhow as well, so I'm back to the first worry. It just seems like it's never good enough, I went to junior high in LOCNAME where I was the smartest kid in the school, the guy everybody and their dog went to for the answer, I come to LOCNAME and suddenly, I'm not the best anymore. Which was alright with me, it unloaded that pressure, blah, blah, but I lost my initiative to try harder than everybody else to get the grade. Since then, my identity has been kind of in the in-between realm, I have intelligence, I was in the top 00 percent of my class, but most of the actual retained knowledge I have from  high school is pop-culture trivia, but I think I could still hold my own on Jeopardy. That is something that made me feel better about college, about a week before I came here, they were showing the Jeopardy college championships, most participants hailing from the LOCNAME LOCNAME, or whatever, and I just tore them apart, even in stuff like Chemistry which I had thought was long gone from my memory after sophomore year, who knew? So I guess I feel alright about classes in the end, maybe it's just because I feel so boring just hanging in my room all the time and don't really feel a part of the student body. I'm sure it'll happen sooner or later, but like most occurances in the history of man, it's over a girl. Long distance relationships are really hard, and here I am trying to pull one off in freshman year, it's going great so far, and I guess it says something that going out and partying runs a distant second to a five minute phone conversation with her, but it's just not helping me become a Longhorn. I love her to death, I really do, so I just haven't worried about it, I figured that it'd work itself out, and I think it still will. Adjustment is hard, especially such an immense one. Gah, college. I've started to believe that there's a soundtrack to life, I guess we'll probably cover that with the psych TA at some point in time, but seriously. Depending on what's going on in my life, I have certain predelections to what kinds of music, and specific songs I listen to, and I guess it's beyond obvious that it has some psychological base, but it's all the time now. I have PROPNAME PROPNAME's   Secret Garden   running through my head right now, most likely because I just started thinking about my girlfriend a while back, which made me think of the times we've spent together, and for some reason bringing about the two of us sitting and watching PROPNAME PROPNAME and remembering PROPNAME from the soundtrack and noticing the correlation of the lyrics with my feelings for this girl. It probably wasn't very smart to have done this this morning, I don't feel like my thoughts are in order. It's the morning of September 00th, I just realized. I'm not worried though, I have faith in this country, I have faith in my own ideals of freedom and life and soforth. Bring em on. If they attack again, I really don't think we can stop them, and it'll suck having more American lives lost, but they can't tear down who we are. There's my bit of patriotism, just thought it appropriate given the day, but my twenty minutes are up, so I'm damming the stream. 
__label__label0 I just had lunch, they actually had good cookies at the dobie cafeteria today. i'm really happy i found out that masha lives in dobie too, she kind of bothered me in high school, but i think i might like her now better than almost anyone i met. she's very sincere. i've been more happy than ever since i've been at ut only because i'm on my own. i feel no sense of homesickness at all, like most people are talking about, i'm the way i like myself without my mother who drives me crazy. i don't understand sometimes how in the world we're related. someone just came in. i love that feeling when you feel like your stuffed animals have personalities, the two dogs on my bed could easily be taken for real ones, well kind of, if one of them wasn't blue, maybe. but not really. alex and arif came by last night, two of my good friends from high school, it made me really happy; i was literally bouncing off the walls because i thought it was nice that they just came by unannounced; i don't know why it surprises me because i know they care about me, but when people i care about do something nice; it kind of surprises me. i could never keep a diary, i absolutely love writing more than anything in the world. i want to become a writer, but i always start with something and never finish or am honestly too lazy and that pisses me off a whole lot. i love it and i want to do it, but i don't know why i won't just do it. but diaries drove me crazy; i found myself being fake in them, i think it's easier to show your true self through other words rather than blatently posting,   i'm writing this about myself to understand myself   it doesn't work like that for me. you can see the real me through other writing i think . i downloaded this song called   forever   by ben harper. it is so good; it has the sweetest melody. it's very wierd; i sometimes write poems and just little phrases and i've noticed i use the color blue a lot. like the ocean is blue and once a poem about my parent's divorce and i used something about a blue world or something; i don't know where it comes from. my mother really drives me insane. her friends were in this past saturday and they came back amazed at my independence, how i looked, acted, just my persona and everything and they weren't like that  before about me. and i know that i do seem a little different; like a relief has been lifted off of me ; it's great. i like the person that i am. i spent too much time babying my mother, making sure i didn't say something to offend her or be upset because she was being ridiculous. and she told me how they though all of this and said it in such a way as to take credit for my development and for me being the way i am, sounding great and all. and i just wanted to scream that it is the opposite; it's only because she's not around. she can't seem to figure anything out for herself like that; she thinks she understands so much, but she doesn't at all and i think deep inside she knows she doesn't get it, but it just makes her feel better about herself to think that she understands it all, whatever it may be, just that she's in control, otherwise she wouldn't not let me stay out after ten some nights when all i did was go to a mmovie with my friends; she just does it to be in control and i wish she would see that she's only pushing me away and she already has; i don't think we will ever have a great relationship, not if she tries to understand me and herself. i just wish she could at least understand herself first. i don't want to be like her when i get older and that's partly why i don't want to agree with her on anything because by doing what she thinks she became the person she is and i don't want to be that person. that's sad and i don't like it, but it's just the way i think it is. i really want to go dancing. a song is playing that's called   just dance   and i want to do just that. 
__label__label0      consious stream of thinking huh. I don't even keep journals or anything, so this is a little different. These chicken taquitos sure are good. A lot of greese though. Ya know, I really like musicals, but only ones from PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and ones from the late 00th century like PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Speaking of, that was a pretty good movie. PROPNAME PROPNAME that is. I wish there had been more in there from the Pirates of P. But it was still pretty good. I can't believe that I have a lecture to go to at 0 to 0:00. At least is isn't on friday. That would really suck. I should download some songs from the Beatles. In fact, I should buy The Yellow Submarine on DVD. That would be a good movie to have. I wonder what movie I should go see this weekend. I haven't been to the movies in a really long time, so surely something new has come out by now. I wonder what these writing assignments are going to be used for. I'm sure it is used in reasearch on us. Oh well. I need to write PROPNAME an e-mail. I haven't see her or PROPNAME in a really long time. They would probably appreciate that. I'll do that tonight after I finish reading the Iliad. I need to read The Rupublic. I meant to a year or two ago, but I never got around to it. I didn't like my classical civilization class at first, but now I'm really getting into it. I don't know if I really want to bother learning guitar or not. I know it is never something that I would seriously persue, but still. At least I've already learned one instrument, so learning another can't be that difficult. Just learn a new clef and everything else is technical stuff that just takes practice. I might as well, I see to have plenty of time on my hands. Except for in the mornings. The past two mornings I've set my alarm early so I could wake up and get some reading done for class. Too bad that both mornings I've overslept and yesterday I was late to physics. Not that it really mattered. I could not go for the rest of the year and still do fine on the final. It's easier than what I took in high-school. My mom called me the other day. I was at starbucks, so I didn't really talk very long. I'll have to call her back tonight when I get in. I'm sure that they miss me. It doesn't feel all that different then when I was at home. I guess I might be homesick if I was going to school in like LOCNAME or something like PROPNAME is, but I'm 0 hours away so it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. I guess it helps also that I stay busy. I also really like oldies music, and soundtracks too. I really want to go buy a Phantom of the Opera CD today. I'll see if they have it at LOCNAME and Noble although it will be an outrageous price. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a really good singer. It really helped that she was married to PROPNAME. That must have been a big career booster. It really doesn't see like I've written all that much. There is a lot more goig on in my head, but I just can't get it all out. Some of the musicals that I really don't like are the ones that came out of a post depression era. They just aren't very original and all seem to be cookie cutter creations just for the sake of being made. 
__label__label0      This is the first writting assingment. I don't realy know what I am soposed to write about. I am also afraid that I will mispell a lot of words. I was talking with a friend on the way to class today. And we started to talk about this assingment. It made me kind of nervouse. But I guess he survived so I will too. I can't belive that only two minutes have passed. I guess that is why it takes so long to write all my papers. And why they are so short. Some times I write a stream of consciousness down on paper. I think it is a good way to get my mind clear. If you write it all on paper you can forget it all for a while. Then after you have rested with it all off your shoulders you can read thoguh it and see if any of it was something important that you need to look into or if not ohh well at least you no longer are thinking about it. I feel like   i should be talking about something more important. But I don't have anything important to talk about. My friend, The guy I mentioned earler, He said that he made sure that he was in a bad/wierd mood befoer he started writing so that way he would have a lot to write about. I think that was probably a good idea. I kind of wish I did that. I feel like I am running out of things to say. So I guess that I will talk about what I see hear smell. Well I am in my room. I see the wall in fromt of me. I hear the computer game my room-mate is playing. He always plays a computer game. Always. but he is a real good guy. The computer game he is playing is some shoot um'up game. You run around with a gun ald kill people, Sleep with one eye open you say right? No its cool. Well I hear all the guns and what not and in the back ground, I guess because he can multi-task I hear music. he plays music movies and this game all at the same time. 00 Min!!! I don't like the song that just came on. What I see I see pictures on my wall. One is with my friend PROPNAME, We were at LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. We were in her cabin before the campers came. She had these two toy firefighters helmets in her cabin, that light up and have a siren when you push the button. So we were running around camp with them on our heads. It was kind of fun. I have know PROPNAME for a long time. We grew up togther. We went to camp togther and youth group conventions. She is realy up beat and friendly. Camp is a great place. I went there when I was a kid, And now I have been staff the past three summers. It is real wierd to see these kids come back evry summer and be a year older. They are so different. They were adorable or obnoxiouse. and now they change or are still the exact same way. You remember when the dident have braces. And now they are getting them off. I remember  when I had breaces. I hated them. But I only had them for one year. I had friends who had them for a long time. Four more mineuts. I realy can't spell and I wish I could. I am at a loss again. My desk is made out of wood. But it is not real wood. It is composit. It is a good desk it does waht it need to. My phone just rang. My room-mate just picked it up becaise I am on the computer with you. It is my friend PROPNAME she  was calling me back. I called her before I started writing. We were soposed to go to the gym. But I think she is there now. Ohh well. So maby abeer jon and I will got down to th  
__label__label1 Ok, well here's the first writing assnment. To begin with, i'm really, really hungry. As is the case, in many college student's lives, i only woke up about an hour ago, and so havent' eaten anything. I've already done laundry though, so I guess you could say i'm semi=productive. I've also talked to Road Runner because they came out the other day and installed the new cable modem in my apartment, but it didn't work. So i tried all the diagnostics that they told me to do, and it still didn't work so i called them this morning. As is always the case, it worked when they asked me to go to the internet, so I seemed like a fool. Well, as soon as we hung up the phone, i tried the internet again, and it didn't work. . I'm pissed. So now i have to use my roommate's computer and a regular internet connection, which is slower than anything else you can imagine.  But on to other things. I'm going to play football with my co-workers from the club on 0th street (the VIBE). It's amazing how you never know when or where a friend might come from. It has always been my belief that a boss will never be a friend, even though it may seem so at times. . . it's really just business. But these guys are different. Perhaps it's the type of business, or maybe they are the one-in-a-million type, or maybe even i'm mistaken, but either way, we're going out to play football as soon as i finish writing this journalistic internet assignment. My best friend had his truck towed yesterday, and the day before he had his wallet stolen, so of course he came to me wanting to know if i'd lend him some money and take him to get his truck back. So, being the good friend that i am, i went to the bank and withdrew 000 dollars and took him to the towyard to get his truck. However, since he didn't have a liscense, i had to sign for the truck, wich only means that i could get into a world of trouble if he ever wanted to screw with me. Apparently by me signing for the truck, my friend could come back the next day and ask for his truck, and since it wouldn't be there, it would be   stolen   which meant i would be held accountable for grand=theft=auto. But i assured my friend that even though he is bigger than i am, i have a lot more friends that are bigger than he is. . you never can tell with people. So back to being hungry again, now my stomach is growling, and i wish i would have eaten before doing this thing. Of course, i am only half way finished, and i grow hungrier as each minute passes. I really shouldn't be playing football today though, because i should be reading all the assignments for my various classes, but what good would that do me?. . . really, i would be a unsocial. . . and besides, i like football better than studying. I guess that's wjhy my grades are the way they are, but who cares, i was a grade worrier all through high school. . i never got a B in my entire li0fe and graduated top 0% (00th of 000). BIG DEAL. I've realized now after 0 years of college that grades really don't mean that much. I mean, yes, you have to graduate and all, but how hard is it to make a 0. 0?  I've failed a couple of classes now, and still have a 0. 0, so you obviously have to REALLY screw up in order to make below a 0 ORGNAME. I guess i shouldn't talk that way, because school is hard for some people, but then again, htat's just an excuse, because i think that anyone can learn somehting, you just have to find the right way to get to them. It's like physics. I can teach anyone physics, it's just a matter of how you explain things. BAck in highschool, my physics teacher was horrible at explaining things, and everyone was alwyas confused, but i would re-explain using every-day examples, and then they would understand. I explained circuit-theory using the large highways in houston (where i lived) as the   circuits  . The cars were the   moving charges  , on-ramps were like batteries, and so forth. Using this method, all the people that i tutored on average scored at least a grade point higher. . give or take. ANyway, i just wish i had it in me to be a teacher because i know i'd be a good one. I just can't see myself teaching. I want to own businesses, and yezs, make a lot of money. I have a business eye. everywhere i go, i'm always seeking a new way to make money, or what business i could start that would flourish. Well, it's almost over, and i must say, i'm not as hungy \as i was at first. So thats it. There's my mind in a nutshell! 
__label__label1      ok im not used to this whole typing stream of conciousness stuff. . but i am listening to the green day cd rite now. doookie. its a good cd. but i also smell this crappy banana smell because i broke a pop ice stick thingie. it REEKS in here. i hope i don't have to use correct grammar and punctuation. . cuz i feel that that is a waste of time. thats so funny to say   that   twice. im weird like that. i wonder who's reading this. because its ok. . im just QUIRKY. anyways. my roommate and i went to yoga last nite. it was rather boring. for exercise i need power and movement and upbeat music and stuff. no more yoga. the stretching aspect of it is interesting. but then id rather take a power stretch class for exercise. wow that is a hard word to spell. . did u notice that i am a really slow typer???. . yes this will b a short one to read. my roommate is about to start praying, so we had to turn the music off. but i dislike silence. . but a girls got to do  wut a girl's got to do. yes so im starting to run out of things to say and its only been three minutes. . this is how vapid i am. i will write about how i am liking the college experience. its rather interesting. i wonder if im allowed to cuss. i think i will but i will stay away from the f word. is that ok with u?. . it better b. any how, yes the reason that im loving college life is that im away from my mother. . o boy this is getting me started all rite. its really dusty in here. my roommate is standing over my shoulder not praying tisk tisk. ok back to my mother. yeah she called me yesterday to bitch at me about my cell phone minutes and my credit card. . u know. . i told her i needed more minutes of my cell phone would b my only phone while im here. but nooooo 00 minutes for a whole month during the wkdays is just sposed to b ok for her i guess. . but then I've already been over 00 mins and its only half  way through the month. so she changed it. . FINALLY. this should work out much much better. and then she sed i shouldn't eat lunch or some nonsense. . i guess talking to her frustrates me because for some reason i always start crying when she lectures me. . i have NO CLUE WHY. but that really freaked out my roommate. . shes never seen me like that before. but its ok she was really cool about it and there are more to come she she better get used to it. . this is nice that i live with her. yes. . so the dust is really getting to me, im choking up hairballs all over the place. i went to my RA but she wasn't there, and the front desk said that we have to go downstairs to fill out a maintenance request form. we'll do that when we go have dinner. dinner here at dobie really isnt worth the amount that we pay to stay here. its decent. . but i expected better. my hands are starting to hurt now. I've never typed this much straight before. this better b good for my forearms. damn man. i need to go back to the gym my roommate is done praying now i bet she's looking over my shoulder. . she's such an eavesdropper!!!!! dude. . ok now i pisseed her off. . hehe jk jk. . she really really wanted to do this assignement with me even tho shes not in psych. its really interseting to her. but it is to me too!!. . i really like this class. . ok. . this sounds like total sucking up. but don't worry i hate sucking up. . im totally honest. . it gets me into trouble sometimes. . i don't know who im sposed to b typing to or if im not sposed to b talking to someone at all. . well its ok. . its stream of conciousness rite?. rite!! i could go for some starbucks rite now!!. . i love that place. . i think with all the exercise i get from the walkin all over this freaking campus balances with the junk i eat. . but i think that for a college student. . i eat pretty healthily. like i eat fruit and bananas and i love milk. . ok i know no one cares. any how. . back to being homesick. the only thing i miss is the familiarity and the friends. but this will change. . austin is steadily becoming more familiar to me and my friends arenot at home anyway. . they all go to other schools. u know. . i really like how i have a movie theatre downstairs from my dorm. i want to see one hour photo with robin williams and michael vartan . just fyi to whoever is reading this I LOVE MICHAEL PROPNAME AND I LOVE ALIAS. alias is this wonderful spy tv show that is on sundays. . its the best show ever. . smartly written good casting. good music. some things tend to b a bit unbelievable but hey its tv wut can i say???. . yeah im typing just like i would b if i were chatting online. . so pardon the weird spelling or abbreviations or puncuation.

__label__label0      I want some ice cream. I will go get some as soon as I finish typing this. I wonder is someone is reading this because otherwise how can the computer analyze this?  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day. too much studying to do. Maybe I should have done this on Friday morning. Oh well, I procrastinate too much so maybe this is a good thing. Gosh twenty minutes is a long time, especially when you are waiting to go get ice cream!  I'm not even hungry, but I haven't had ice cream is so long. Why do the guy floors in this building keep serenading?  Seems kind of odd that guys would do that for strangers. I like my room. It's very colorful, but I would still like to add more decorations. Perhaps more butterflies because it is a unique touch. Gosh, only a quarter done. I want my ice cream!!! Aww I can hear people yelling. how annoying. I would study in the library, but it seems kind of scary. This morning was scary. Yeah, I am never going to run by myself anywhere at 0:00 in the morning. I don't know if I want to make LOCNAME Crew or not. It seems really cool and I got a rush just from exercising this morning, but on the other hand, it is also tiring, expensive, and I have to go through the trouble of finding a ride every day so I won't have to walk all the way to First Street again. Hmmm, I'm having trouble thinking of stuff. Oh I did not like today's   quote of the day  . It had something to do with God making the LOCNAME round. I wanted to erase it, but I figured that might be a little rude. The sign should say   PROPNAME's quote of the day   since I don't really care and I don't choose which ones go up there. I should have a   Drawing of the day   or something silly like that. Yeah, maybe of the week so I won't have to do so much. I prolly shouldnt' have typed that bit about today's quote, considering she is standing like a couple of feet behind me. Man sometimes I am so evil, but deep down I believe I am good. Oh my goodness, I am only halfway done. Do I have to keep writing like this?  I'm not sure if I really think about stuff this often. I may be just searching for topics to write about. Kind of like small talk, which by the way I cannot stand, partially because I am no good at it. I can't wait until this weekend's field trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME!  I havent been on a field trip since like elementary school. Well, on a good field trip. Maybe that's because there is nowhere interesting to go in Texas, er LOCNAME. This weekend is going to be so much fun, hopefully. I like a lot of the Women in Natural Sciences girls. A couple of the white girls seem kind of cocky though. Like my next door neighbor. She is never smiling, and she only comes over to talk if she wants something, such as markers. She came over the other day to ask for markers because she didn't want to use her sharpies because she said they would run out. Um, okay. so it's okay if other people's stuff runs out? Geez, and I see her talking to the professors alot trying to suck up. She annoys me already. Whoohoo only a minute and a half left! That's really what I'm thinking. Also I want to play ping pong downstairs with PROPNAME and ORGNAME, but I probably don't have time because I procrastinated this weekend. Dang it. okay I will just wait for the time to run out. 00. 0. 0. 0. 0. . 0. . 0. 0. 0. 0. yay 
__label__label0      I really don't know what I am thinking at this moment. I am in a state of emotional turmoil at the moment. I can't believe they cancelled Farscape. I see no logical reason why that was necessary. I mean, the show had decent ratings ORGNAME PROPNAME had already agreed to pick it up for another season. It has to be something that doesn't concern the show. If I were paranoid I would say it was a big government conspiracy to see how people react to great emotional turmoil. I can't believe this is happening. There is no reason for it. It can't be financial difficulties. Farscape is the highest rated series on the ORGNAME ORGNAME. This is completely unbelievable. This is a major flaw on  their part. They cannot possibly be sane or sober. Maybe all of the executives are are currrently in the process of overdosing on crack, coccaine, heroine, and ecstasy. They have to be mad. There is no other logical explanation for this. It is freaking stupid. Complete idiocy. This only further proves that the ORGNAME ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME is truly run by a bunch of apes who have no grasp on reality. This sucks. They might need to be tortured to see the error of their ways. all of them. I wonder if the police are goign to get a  hold of me for writting some of this. oh well, at thist point i really couldn't care. i really have  no idea why i decided tto write this now, i guess i j ust needed a distraction from my own thoughts on this tragedy, at least a tragedy in my mind. Damn, this is so fucking stupid that they are doing  this. This really sucks because i just realized that the time counter thing on this paage that keeps track of how long i have been writing is not working. So i have no idea how long i have been writing. I am quite aggitated now, i have to write for an even longer period of time  to make sure that i write at least the required 00 minutes. i hope a new network decides to pick up Farscape. I really hope so. It really sucks taht it is being canceled after its current season. This is totally screwed up. THERE  IS NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION. Every CEO and executive HAS to be high on something to come  to this decision.  I wonder how long i have been writing?  I guess i t started a t about 0:00. Taht is only a guess though, i reallly have no clue when I started this. I hate not having controll over a situation. I hate that there is not a whole  lot  i can do to reverse the fate of Farscape. I hate that i don't know how long i have been writing this thisn. My leg hurts. I hope all the letters i sent to all of  the higher brain function deficient PROPNAME and LOCNAME LOCNAME execs can see the error of their ways and NOT cancel a great show. I would like to boycott the channel but i also watch another series on it. DAMN ME FOR LIKING STARGATE: SG-0!!!  I wish i didn't like taht other sereies so  i could wholeheardedly boycott the sons of trelks.  My sister hates math, she jsut asked me a math question. I don't like teaching people things, i get easily frustrated when i know something and have explain to others.  If the ORGNAME ORGNAME was STUPID enought to cancel thier highest rated show then  no  other program is safe, the will probably cancel Stargate nec (the assholes) and then i would REALLY have a reason  to boycott. i wonder how long i have been writing this?  Alll of the ORGNAME execs and ORGNAME ORGNAME boneheads should be tortured for thieir stupidity in this matter. I would like to be a major contributor in their pain at this moment. Those bastards. how can they do this to me?  how can they do this to my sister?  This blows goats. Damn them. I wonder what it  would be like for them to scream in uninhibited pain and angiush, does this make me a bad person?  I don't think so, not at the moment. They deserve whatever the get. My sister would tie them down for me so i could get to the torturing without fear of them escaping. I think  that time has run  out. I don't know   if it has. The damn counter is all screwed up. If i submit this and i don't get credit because i didn't write for a long enough period of time, i will be pissed. It's not my fault that this damn time thing isn't working. I wish they would reevaluate their decision to cancel. i hope this has beeen and adequate amoutn of time. Well Hell, I'm getting more angry writing about how wronged i have been, like everyone else that they are canceling what is possibly the greates show on the air. 
__label__label0      well i guess the first thing or the thing that i am sort of forcing myself to now think about is what i was thinking about before. and that would be how much i miss my best friend. i was eating at ORGNAME's and i was really hungry because i hadnt eaten anything all day and it was already 0 by then. so i ate a jr. cheese burger, medium fries, and some orange juice. then i went bak and got a salad, frosty, and some water. but i dint really know anyone there because the two friends i came with went to a HOSA meeting so i was by myself for a while so i started thinking. and my thoughts were many but they sort of led back to my best friend PROPNAME at ORGNAME ORGNAME. i don't really know exactly what i was thinking or what i am thinking but i know it was something along the lines of i just really wish i could spend some time with her. i guess i'll get bak to her later when i think of more. my cell phone just rang so i guess that interrupted my train of thought. and iM guessing its most probably Amit because it said   unknown   for the caller ID which most prob. means that its him because his phone is the only one that does that. Also i am really use to pushing   Ctrl S   and i can't really do that here because i am not  writing a word document - i am glad i have developed this habit because it ensures that 00% of the work i have done is saved every few minutes because i really hate having to redo work. now i guess i was just thinking of the clock. i was sort of seeing how fast it would go - like i am sort of surprised that it is already 0 minutes. i thought because of what PROPNAME said that it would take quite a bit of time but time seems to be going by fast enough. my eyes are burning i think because of my contacts because i have gotten enough sleep since i sort of woke up at 0 o' clock today. Once again. i guess my mind - - she just called and it made me feel a lot better because i just told her that she was going to live a thousand years since i was thinking about her. and she was like   awwww I Love You   in the cutest little voice and hten i told her i had to finish this and i also have like no daytime minutes due to a family plan. and now the dorm phone rang and PROPNAME called. i guess we don't have too much peace and quiet in this dorm. lol. but ya it was really cool that she called. and she is stored on my cell phone as 'princess' so its really cool seeing that pop up on my phone!  Well besides i guess really wanting to see and hug her i don't know much else that i am thinking about currently. i guess maybe finding out how much a Greyhound ticket to ORGNAME costs since i would love to go there. Well i guess i also need to figure out what i need to do for the remainder of the day such as finish my MIS homework, chek the emails from ORGNAME, check out the Sprint family plans so i can see how to get more daytime minutes, read some Eco, go over Eco notes, read some Philosophy, and the Philosophy book, read the beginning of the Psychology book, and finish Chapter 0 of MIS, and finish reading Developing You Into Me of Ba000. wow i guess i have quite a bit of reading to catch up on. so maybe i should take care of that for the remainder of the day rather than wake up at 0 o' clock. i really need to wake up earlier and get my homework done. it would be really beneficial to me if i started doing that. Besides all that, PROPNAME, my roommate, also suggested a movie at 0 playing for free at the Union so i may look into that. besides all of that i think i need to use the restroom after i am done with this and i don't really know why i just wrote that down besides the fact that it says write everything you are thinking about and so i was thinking about that so i thought id write it down - just like i was thinking about writing about thinking about going to the bathroom - so i did write it. now my mind is just free i guess. in regards to tom. which is Friday and now the phone just rang and now 00 minutes is over but i was just thinking in regards to tomorrow and the rest of the weekend what i am going to do - whether im going to go home or just stay here but i guess i'll think more about that later 
__label__label0 My fiance is making me do my writing assignment now. He just pushed me in front of the computer. This is my third time to try and do this thing. I'm really hoping that it works this time. It gets kind of frustrating. PROPNAME wants to read what I'm typing. He's making me nervous because I don't want him to read this, but I'm sure he'll figure some way to see it. He says that I don't trusthim because i don't want him to read it. I don't like loud noises, especially from things like vacuums. PROPNAME is vacuuming right now. I don't like it when people play music loud either. It just bothers me. I love PROPNAME, sometimes I just don't get what he expects from me. I am so tired. I haven't slept since I came to LOCNAME. Thats probably because my bed is broken and no one has come to fix it yet. I'm really thirsty. I just walked back to campus from the capitol. PROPNAME bought me one of those glowing necklace things. September 00th makes me sad. I was is my chemisty class at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and the principal made an announcement for all of us to meet in the cafeteria. I didn't believe it at first. Why does PROPNAME always bug me. He likes to see how much he can annoy me. I love him, but I don't like to be bothered. I'm starting to get really sleepy. I don't want to go to class tomorrow. My freshman seminar should be a really easy class, but I don't do well speaking in front of people and I'm not very creative. I'm probably the least creative person on the planet. I want to go home. I can't wait until friday because I get to go home. Sometimes I think that I can't stand my family, but when I'm in Austin, I wish I was home with them. My roommate is out with some weird guy she met on the internet. I swear she's with a new one every day. I'm afraid something bad is going to happen to her. Raquetball is fun to play. PROPNAME and I were supposed to play yesterday, but we forgot. Its really hot in here. I'm usually always cold.  My contacts are bothering me. I think I need to put in a new pair. I'm really thirsty. I wonder what other people are writing about. I've always wondered what other people think about. I wonder if people think as weird of things as me. Sometimes I think really weird things and have no idea why. I really like cranberry juice. Its pretty good. I need to clean my room. My roommate and I are both really messy. It looks pretty bad. I really like frogs. I have so much frog stuff. I feel like I've been typing forever. Time seems to be going incredibly slow. A Walk to Remember is a really good movie. Sometimes I miss working at the movies. but I hated working there too. I guess that's just the way it goes. My fish are pretty cool. There salt water fish and are very pretty. I don't like it when PROPNAME touches me in certain places. I just don't want to be touched there. It doesn't make me feel good. But if I say anything to him about it, he gets mad, and thinks that I don't love him and don't want to mess around with him, etc. I really don't feel good. My trashbags smell like vanilla. They smell pretty good without the trash in them. Three minutes left. Yay. Jesse freaks out over the strangest things, especially anything star trek. I don't like that show. I'm don't like most things that are sci-fi. I used to though, I'm not sure why I don't anymore. Time goes by really really slow. Work is boring. I never actually do much work. Making copies isn't exactly exciting. But I'm not exactly exciting anyways. I also have no sense of humor and can be incredibly boring at times. Yay!! I'm finally done. That took forever. 
__label__label0 I wish that I could type more quickly, so that I would be able to follow my thoughts. I should take a typing class like don said he did. That makes me think of my trip to LOCNAME, look. there is a picture of that trip on my desk. I am glad that I got into san jac!Hopefully the spirits will accept me. Man, I forgot to put my name on the back of that picture. I hope that they do not disqualify me for that. I don't want to get rejected. I cannot believe that I got those scholarships. I am glad that I did, because PROPNAME did. I got more proportionally than she did. It shouldn't really matter. Well it does. I can hear the movie on behind me. I love the 00s movies like this one. I like the kevin PROPNAME movies too. PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME was disapointing. I liked PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wish that I could have true love. I do not think that I really believe in it any more. I want to, but I can not trust other people enough. I think that it is my father's influence. He always says that you can fall in love with anyone that you choose to love. I Hate that. I hate that he told me that so many times when I was young. I hate how my parents fight all the time. I hope that they do not get a divorce. That would be horrible for ray ray. Poor guy. I do not even know if Daddy cares about him. I know he loves him, but he does not really like him. I can try to make up for that. If we were orphans I would take care of him and lauren. I think that i wish that we were orphans sometimes. Just so that there was something worthwhile in my life. I have not done anything in y life. There is almost nothing different in the world because of me. This is a depressing line of thought. I should try to be happy. I always think that unhappiness is a weakness. Another gift from my dad. He does not even know that I think about that stuff. PROPNAME is awesome. I wish that I had some kind of powers. I think I might be able to have paranormal dreams. Maybe I just want to so badly. I wish that magic was real. I would give alot to have some real magic in my life. I think that I am starting to doubt my faith. I do not feel very bad about it either. I stayed up till six am last night. I hope that I can sleep tonight. I am going home next weekend. Some people are not going home for a long time. Just at Thanksgiving. MMMM thanksgiving rules. I am glad that my family loves and misses me, and that I can miss them. I hope that I can meet alot of people while I am here. I want to be in love. I want to have adventure. And I want everyone to know it. I wish I could be famous, I wish I could be a hero. I hope that I am strong enough that I could be a hero. I am afraid that I am not strong enough. Should I keep acting strong, or be what i am. I am afraid that my friends will find out that I am not what I seem like. I wonder if they are really what they act like. I should not lie anymore. Not, actual lies, but weird ones. I love some of my friends. I used fatty. That is wrong. I have to be a better friend. I used her to make friends with her roomate. They do not like PROPNAME anymore for some reason. I hope that I do as well as I can here. Ihope that as well as i can do is enough.  
__label__label0 Today I got a new washer and dryer. I know this is kind of corny to write about, but I am so excited. I won't have to use the laundry room for the apartment complex anymore, because now ì have my own washer and dryer. It cost one dollar to wash and one dollar to dry, in the wash room. My clothes didn't event come out dry. I was so pissed. I am very very thankful for my parents. I would not have this BRANDNEW washer and dryer if it were not for them. God has truly blessed us as a family. My family is a strong, close family. They are always there for me and my sisters no matter what happens. Right now my nieces and nephew ar living with my mom and dad. My sisters are in the ORGNAME,so their children stay with my parents. My mom loves it, but I know it is very hard on her. It is hard on me when I go home to visit. I never get any rest. I am always up around 0:00 in the morning. Someone is always crying at one time or another. Especially PROPNAME, he cries around three in the morning when everyone is asleep. I love going home, but man I get so happy when it is time for me to com back to LOCNAME. This typing thing is going by pretty slow. I swear I have been on here for ten minutes already. I don't even know what else to type about. I could type about my ex-fiance, that would take more than twenty minutes. I am still paying for my foolishness behind him. We were together for a long time, then he proposed. yeah, that same old traditional, only the right way to go kind of things. Anyway, we were together for a long time, about 0 yrs. He proposed in front of my whole family on Dec. 00, which happened to be the day my family celebrated Christmas that yeat. I cried, I said yes . Then all of the drama started, he wanted ot hang out with his friends all of the time , and I just got tired of all of the foolishness. I guess he got tired of all of it too. SO, he broke up with me. I cired for a little while, but my mom helped me out a lot. She told me,   Every woman has her heart broken at least one time, and baby this is your time  . I didn't want to believe it but it was true. I faced the facts, picked up my heart and moved on. It's not time yet!!!!!!!!!!!!! PROPNAME the insanity. I guess I will type really slow so time will go by really fast. I never knew twenty minutes would take this long. Time flys by when you're having fun. I guess this is not one of those times. I'm almost there though. I wonder what everyone else wrote about. You know, I feel like I'm talking to myself or some kind of imaginary friend. This seems so funny. Well I guess I'll take these last few minutes to say my goodbyes. I'm just playing, wasn't that funny. No, I didn't think so either. It's only 0:00, I thought it was eleven o'clock. I did that eleven o'clock to waste time. TWO MORE MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's so delightful. I guess my fingers needed the workout. Poor fingers. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm what to  do, what to do . 00, 0, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,          
__label__label0      So, I'm supposed to be wtiting something. hmmm, looks like blank for now. that lady at the library help desk is really talking fast, or maybe i'm. i can't believe my sister didn't call me back, we were supposed to go grocery shopping. i keep hitting the back slash butten and then i have to stop and delete it. la dee da. biology note. now that woman can talk fast. she's just out of school too. and she has a good job. hope i can find a good job once i get out of school, of course that first means that i have to get out of school . when ever that is. nice pants. actually never, i don't really like heather grey. my mom always says that makes me look washed out. whatever that means. blank. another blank. i hope that the timer on this computer doesn't go out berfore the writing assignment timer goes out. writing assignment. library online. i have so much work to do. . wendy's that's sounds goood. i;m wearing a lot of blue. i always wear a lot of blue. . blue pen, blue spiral, blue notepad, blue mouse pad, even the E for internet explorer is blue. too much blue. hmmmmmmmm. keep writing don't stop. this will be jam packed. oh yeah. i wonder what tthis is for too. oops mispelled this. should i go back and change it. ha ha , when i type i saay everything so slowly. at least i haven't mispelled more words. finally got my bracelet back. PROPNAME. that was wierd seeing him again. what was even more wierd was seeing him wearing my bracelet. jerk off. oh, i wonder if it ws okay for me to   say   jerk off in this writing assignment, oh well, too late. finish button. can't wait to click on you. i crack my knuckles a lot. i hope i don't get arthritis. that would be a nice addition to the collection of future annoyances. hey that guy ws kind of cute. never mind! he turned around. mark is cute. yes he is. i wish he would call me back, but he's busy at work. raaaaaaaarrrrr. wait a second. has it been twenty minutes. am i supposed to keep track of the twenty minutes or does the computer automatically cut you off after twenty minutes? it's got to have been more than 00 minutes. at  least. i wonder why he said   set the right key    set the right key to what?  right, right.    
__label__label1      yeah so i really don't want to be doing this but oh well. i really actually enjoy the psych class though sometimes i wonder how exactly anyone can figure out what a person is thinking. who came up with those experiments in the first place. im so relaxed right now cause i just got back from having a one hour massage. it was kind of weird at first cause i had never had one before but after like 00 min i was asleep. i so needed a massage, and i always seem to be tired even though i feel i get plenty of sleep. i don't think im typing as fast as i should be because there is this little voice saying you mispelled a word, go back and correct it. i guess that means i don't know if im actually completing the exercise correctly. but he never did list whether things had to be grammarically correct. i feel that im like this never ending jutebox that won't stop talking. right now im typing like those really annoying people that you never want to listen to that you are just like SHUT UP. haha. yeah so i have alot of stuff on my mind lately. i would like to actually call this my vent session because i have all this stuff in my mind thats just really been bugging me and i can't tell anyone because my best friend is so far up my roommates butt, because they are boyfriend and girlfriend, that i can say how i REALLY feel. my roommate can be such a jerk sometimes. and he does the stupidest things that just totally piss me off. like this one time i got back home from houston and he was like its your turn to buy the groceries. but i was the one that bought eighty-eight dollars in food when he only bought thirty. he was like well I've finally caught up with you now and I've spent one hundred and eighty. and im thinking, well jeez im sorry to put you out but i barely ever eat. i swear he eats like there is no tomorrow and i think that I've narrowed it down to how many times he eats a day. like 0!  it just really pisses me off. and he tells ME how i do nothing. im not the one who has tuesday and thursday off. not only that he sleep all freakin day. hes SO LAZY. i just want to say to him, hey im not the one that spends 00 freakin dollars on the lunch meat you pick out and watch them cut. come on and give me a freakin break. on top of the whole grocery issue, my parents have ME on a strict budget and so i can't spend all that much money. he goes out and buys a three hundred dollar tv because he feels like it. what can you say to that. his dad is working his butt off to pay for all the crap my roommate uses. dang the phone is ringing now and i can't concentrate anymore on what i was saying. anyways. yeah so i just want to be like, why don't you get off your lazy, pardon my language ass, and get a freakin job and stop mooching off of all your daddy's money. its not like his parents are rich either, he just thinks he is. on top of that he is sooo vain. everything on him and around him is so perfect. sometimes i wonder if hes a girl at heart or if he just LOVES looking at himself in the mirror.   god if only i was brave enough to tell him how i really feel. it wouldn't be so bad except for the fact is that its my freaking apartment too and my best friend, though i love her to death, is living with us. its like nightmare that never ends. you know those feelings when you are a third wheel and you just want to get the hell out? can you imagine it like 00/0. its horrible. it just makes you want to crawl in a hole and die. come on i pay for the freaking apartment the least she could do is STOP mooching off of us and possibly go home?  jeez.  on the topic of being a third wheel. i have this issue with two guys. im seeing this guy in houston that i like alot since my last boyfriend who totally broke my heart. lets say the guy im dating now is bob, and my ex is paul. so bob is like so sweet and hes alot older than me and i miss him a whole lot. at the same time paul who NOW goes to school with me, the reason we broke up is a long story, well we are becoming good friends. i never expected the thing with bob to actually happen over the summer and so now i have this like guy who i don't know exactly what we are but is considered a long distance relationship. bob has been nothing but sweet to me and i love him,  actually wait another thing he doesn't want me to tell him that i love him either. i mean maybe i do and maybe i don't. so yeah, me and paul have become best friends again after our whole breakup and his cheating on me with the girlfriend he had, but then calling me to tell me two weeks before school started back up that he had broken up with her. come on now, i haven't talken to paul in like forever then he calls me to tell me hes broken up with his girl friend. strange yes. but I've told myself that I've gotten over with him after being his girlfriend for two and half years. thats a long time to spend on one person. so yeah he came over yesterday to hang out with me while i was waiting for the time warner roadrunner dudes to come over and me and paul started watching a movie together. he started getting closer and closer to me but i was like woah arent we just friends. so i get up to get a drink, come back to my room and lay down on my bed. paul sits on my back and starts giving me a   friendly back massage   and all the while i was thinking that i really miss him and that i wouldn't mind getting back together with him. at this time bob hadn't called me since sunday night and i was getting really worried. so i started relaxing and having a good ole time with paul. later that night bob calls and hes like hey sweetie, i miss you and im sorry i haven't called you but I've been really busy and i tried sending you and email but it didn't work. yeah so now im caught in this situation that i can't seem to get out of or fig ure out. should i go after my ex that is here in austin. or should i go after bob whose been nothing but sweet to me, but is back home. i don't know what  i should do. and on top of all of this im sorta lonely, and i have alot of school work to take care and if i WANT a social life that not only that i can't seem to find ,and i have to work. i think that im slowly going insaine and this is too much things to think about for a person at my age. woah so yeah im going to stop now cause I've actually typed past the twenty min but i kind of feel better though 
__label__label0      Well i just got back from LOCNAME, where i live. It was weird going back. Kind of like this isn't my home anymore, even though LOCNAME isn't my home. It's just my temporary home. It's weird though seeing my parents, knowing that I won't see them for a long time. It was good to see them again. I hope I'm not going to make myself too crazy up here with school. School is my number one priority. I want to have a good life after this, i don't want to end up in a job i hate. Hopefully i figure out what i want to do with my life. I don't know if i want to teach, or work for a record label, or write for the rest of my life, or do something with crime scene investigation. I think being a criminal psycologist would be a lot of fun. I bet it would never get boring! I just hope I'm not getting in over my head with this class. I've always been interested in psycology, and how people act and why, and what causes it, but I'm afraid i will be over my head. Hopefully not. It seems like it will be very intersting despite the hard work I know will come. It's very strange being in a class that's so huge! I'm used to being in classes with no more than 00 people. I guess all freshmen are though. I still feel like I'm kind of out of place sometimes here. Luckily I've been making friends with the people on my floor. Everyone here seems really cool. There are a few girls down the hall that are soo cool! I could see myself being friends with them for awhile. I hope so at least! Everyone here seems very nice and friendly. (At least the people on my half of the floor does. ) The other side seems very anti-social. We all have our doors open on this side of the floor, but I never see any of their doors open down the hall. It's strange, but i don't really miss many of my friends. I don't think this makes me a bad friend, I just think i was ready to separate from them. Some of them at least. But I thought I was going to miss some of them SO much, but in reality, I don't miss many of them. Especially some of the friends I was supposedly   best friends   with. I sometimes wonder if I'm missed. I wonder if I was as good of a friend as i thought I was. I don't know. One of the girls down the floor just got back frlom out of town. She's one of the girls i think i could be good friends with for awhile after this year. She's a lot like me! Surprisingly. It's hard to find people who don't really drink, and have more fun just hanging out, and going bowling, or going to the movies, instead of going to a frat, or a big party. It's cool though that she's like that. It's nice to find someone who likes the same things you do, especially when they're so uncommon around college kids! I've only been back for a few hours, and I don't miss my parents! I thought i would miss them more. I think this means I'm grown up now! haha, grown up. That's weird to think. I don't feel like I'm grown up. I still feel like the same old nerd from LOCNAME. haha. I finally threw my flowers out that were sent to me, and washed the vase. They were starting to smell a little funky. PROPNAME, my roommate just got back from the grocery store. I hope she bought good food! hehe. The food here is pretty good though, surprisingly. Not like home, but good enough to eat. Some of it is really good though, you just have to pick the right things is all. I could talk about food all day! haha. I can't wait to watch Sex and the City tonight with some girs from the floor. Since we don't get ORGNAME here my mom taped the last 0 episodes and I brought them abck for all of us poor girls with no ORGNAME! Hopefully PROPNAME gets back from dropping her boyfriend off at SW in not too long. I have an early class in the morning, and i don't want to miss it. Especially since it's a class of 00 people, it would be hard to go unnoticed. I think it will be a fun class. It's Jazz and Literature. I love listening to jazz, but there's going to be a lot of writing and reading. Hopefully the writing will be fun. I love creative writing and writing like this, just writing whatever comes to my head. But essays and stuff aren't that fun. I don't know anyone who likes writing them though. My rhetoric class is going to be a lot of that not fun writing though. Yuck. Oh well it's a class I have to take. Hopefully I'll enjoy it though. Otherwise it's going to be hard to drag myself to the class every Tuesday and Thursday. 
__label__label0 Right now I'm sitting in my dorm room. The TV is on and the band called   The Calling   is playing. I really like they're music, they kind of soothe my thoughts and put me at ease. Music plays an integral role in how my attitude is for a certain day or time. Many times I'll listen to something that is very hard and angry and it will put me in a bad mood, however, that rarely happens. I'm really kind of worried about my laundry at this time. I have honestly never washed any clothes, so it presents a particularly daunting task to myself. I have just realized how long 00 minutes is, and it seems a lot longer than what i figured it would be. Although this task isn't particularly challenging, it's interesting to try to think about what i'm thinking about. Many times I think the things I'm thinking of are reflected by hearing as well as sight. I've noticed this because I'm listening to music now and the song is a mellow number that is making me really relaxed. I need to make some Gatorade, because I drank all of it yesterday. PROPNAME PROPNAME is really hot, there's a picture of her in front of me, and she is beautiful. Now there's two songs playing at the same time, and that is sort of bothering me. First of all because i like them both, second of all because it's hard to keep up with both of them. Earlier I mentioned that my laundry was bothering me, well that is really a trivial task. More precendent on my mind is making good grades in my classes. College is easy so far, however I haven't had any tests and just one quiz, in my Spanish class. I think i fared ok on that quiz, so I'm happy about that. However, I'm still very curious as to what I actually made. When i first got to Jester my allergies acted up really bad, due to the inordinate amount of dust in the room. After the first week I got acclimated to it, I guess, and now I'm doing just fine. I had an appointment at the ORGNAME to get my allergy shots this afternoon, so I treked over there after I ate lunch. When i got there the lady informed me that she had double booked the nurse in charge of giving shots. She was paranoid that I would be mad at her, but of course I wasn't mad. It takes a lot to get me mad, and something like that is just a minor inconvenience to me. So I just went about my way. I am also happy that I got my computer problem resolved. Seether put on a great show at LOCNAME on Saturday. Their lead singer sounds a lot like PROPNAME PROPNAME, who was awesome. All of Seether's songs were really great, they impressed me. PROPNAME put on a good show too, as did Lost Prophets. Wow, I find myself continually looking at the time above, to see how close I am to getting finished with this assignment. I'm really thirsty. Another thing that perplexes me is the experiments for this class. I suppose I'll try to sign up for something after I finish this typing assignment. I'm really kind of worried about getting all those experiments done and all that. I guess that worry stems from not knowing that much about the experiments. Lately my feet have started hurting a little bit, well, i guess it's not really a   hurt  , but more of a burn. Perhaps my soles are giving out. Wow, I'm almost finished, I have less than 00 seconds left. This was really kind of cool, the 00 minutes went by pretty fast, bye. 
__label__label0  I hope I'm doing this right because I'm not sure. I feel so tired and I have so many things to do in such short time. I wonder if I'll pass all my classes. I'm afraid that I won't make A's and not make it into Medical school. I can imagine how my dad's sisters will laugh at him and tell him that they knew I wasn't going to make it. I feel lost, depressed, and anxious. Who should I talk to, well mayb nobody because what if people think I'm crazy or stupid or something. Everyone else seems relaxed and having a great time. I can't even walk out of my room because I either have homework or some quiz to study. I can't believe I froze today on my quiz and miss two simple questions. What's wrong with me? I used to take pressure fine now I feel like some crazy person. I miss PROPNAME, my boyfriend. He understands me. The good thing is that he's coming down and if my dad brings my truck up here, I can go and pick him up at the airport. I want to bring him back to LOCNAME and show him around. It's going to be nice to walk with him down the Drag and just showing him the campus. I can't wait to see him. I hope everything goes well since tomorrow is Friday the thirteenth. I don't want anything to happen to him while he's flying over here. If anything happens to him, I'll feel terrible because I'm the only reason he's coming down. I hope I can have a good weekend with him. I want to spend as much time as possible with him. But with my parents, God, I can imagine them. They take things so seriously. I wish they weren't so strict and understand that me and PROPNAME are serious about each other. I guess that's why I'm so shy. I could never go out or do anything. Now I can't keep a conversation with anyone because I think that they don't like me but oh, well I don't need them. I have such a headache. It's just all these thoughts I have in my head. I wonder who's going to read this. They're going to think I'm some kind of psycho, however you spell that. Life is so crazy for me. I can never relax or kick back. I hope to God that in the end this will pay off. I wish I was already in med school but hey it all takes time. Now I understand what Dr. PROPNAME said. That man is so brillant. I hope to be just like him. He does surgeries like nothing. And to think that he didn't make it to med school here in the LOCNAME and had to go to LOCNAME. If he didn't make it with straight a's here at LOCNAME, what makes me think that I will. What did I get myself into? But this is my dream and I'm afraid to disappoint my family. I've always told them I was going to be a Doctor and if I don't they're going to ask me why, some will laugh at me, others will disapprove of me like Mr. PROPNAME, others will rub it in my face. How embarrassing? Agh! I even got voted most successful in high school. I can imagine everyone talking about me and how I thought I was so smart. If only they knew I had to work really hard for my grades. I was just like them. I want my mom to be proud of me and I want her to know that when she's old I'll take good care of her. I don't want to see her working hard anymore. Well this felt a little better taking everything out but now I feel like crying. Maybe that will help as well.    
__label__label1      So I started my college life about two weeks ago. It has all gone pretty much as to what I had expected it to be like. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME which is an off campus dorm and I have met tons of new people. I live with four girls whom I didnt know when I first started school. Some older people at the ORGNAME set us up. I really like the fact that we are all starting new with each other. We get to experience our new life together. We get along great and do everything together. I am also really enjoying the fact that I get to make all my decisions on my own. Not having parents around all the time has its up's and it's downs. I mean I don't have someone annoying me all the time about finishing my work I have to realize when it has to be turned in and different deadlines for tests and projects. I have however found it kind of difficult to really take on a full schedule and truly realize everything that has to be taken care of in one full day. I have noticed that there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything completly finished. With homework, reading, running errands and outside activites there is so much to do with so little time. My roomate and I have had grown very close over the past two weeks. We have developed many habbits that we both enjoy. We realized that it takes the longest for the two of us to get ready and we love listening to music while we get ready because it pumps us up and gets us excited. I feel that the two of us are only going to get closer as our college life unfolds itself. We both experienced ORGNAME ORGNAME together. We both wanted to join the same sorority so that we could have another aspect of our life in college together to be the same. We accomplished another goal of us and we both got bids to the same sorority. I feel at home whenever I am at the house. Each and every girl is excited with open arms to welcome all 00 of the new pledges. I am so glad that not only are we roomates with each other we are sorority sisters as well. Other than my social life and living arrangements at school, the most important aspect is my education. I am taking 0 classes which comes out to 00 hours. I chose the classes that I wanted to take and the first two weeks have gone great. The work load started off fine and I think that I am going to be able to handle everything. I was a little nervous at first about the large classes because I came from a high school that was a decent size but the classes ranged from 00-00 people. My classes at LOCNAME on the other hand were quite large. I didnt know if I was going to be able to concentrate during a lecture if there were on average 000-000 people in the classes. As soon as one day passed I knew it wouldnt be a problem as long as I got to class early so that I would have a decent seat and be able to listen as closly as I could. As these last two weeks have flown by I have realized differnt tecniques to make the rest of my experiences at LOCNAME even better. I have learned from my mistakes and I have gained from my experiences.                       
__label__label1      I don't understand many of the girls on my hall. They are all so immature and obnoxious. I want to meet mew people but I have a hard time giving any of these girls a real chance. I miss my little sisters and worry about them. My mother worries a lot about all of the things they may get into that are bad for them. I kind of screwed things up for them. I shouldn't have gotten into so much trouble in high school. It was fun though. I am so far away from anything I am familiar with. I have been away from home many times and it does not bother me. I did not realize being in school would disruot my comfort zone in the way that it has. I want to experience Austin but have no on to experience it with and am afraid to go out alone, especially at night. I feel full and I love ice cream. I am very tierd for no reason at all. I am worried that I will not be able to find some really good friends. I am excited. I got a really good wristband for the OU game. Hell yeah!!!  I went to dinner with one of my neighbors tonight and I just know everything she said to me was a total crock of shit. I don't understand why people lie like that, maybe she is an obssessive compulsive liar. I hate computers, I hate how the entire system of life is now dominated by them. They are just machines, not people. American's are so detatched. September eleventh is tomorrow. The last stream of conciousness I did was about PROPNAME PROPNAME and Peeps. I love Peeps. Why do they only make them at Easter. Just like egg nog at Christmas. You can only have egg nog at Christmas though. It's like an overload of egg nog if you have a lot of it. Moderation is important. My roomie is nothing like me. How in the hell did we end up living together. It's because my mom altered my questionaire. The lack of freedom!!!!!  I think it is awful that they put animals into zoos. That should be illegal. They could have rehab clinics for the ones that they rescue but they shouldnt make their mony off of people coming in to look at them. I talked to a guy that was a Comp something or other major and when I asked him what that was he said he didn't know!!  How can you not know what your major is???  That is just wrong. I think he was just messing with me. I went to ground zero, it really impacted me in a different way. I never know if I am ding stream of conciousness writing the right way. There is no right way though. I HATE COMPUTERS. Typing was invented by the devil. The home keys???  I just hate them. Music is so important to us. I wish I had a larger vocabulary. Why do people use people?  I only have a little bit left. When I work out only 00 seconds or a single repetition can last forever. I guess I'm feelin' alright. It's all going to be good in the end. 
__label__label1 Wow! This has been a crazy day! I am really overwhelmed by everything. I'm sitting in my dormroom right now and and all I can't think about is last night. I'm still really really mad. All of these rude girls were running down the hall at 0:00 in the morning, screaming, yelling,and slamming doors. I got only a few hours of sleep. This really sucks especially since I came home early from LOCNAME just so I could sleep. I could have spent the night there and hung out with PROPNAME, my boyfriend if i had known that i would be kept up that late. Oh yeah, I really miss PROPNAME right now! He's supposed to call me today when he gets out of class, which was about, uh, two hours ago. I could just call him but first of all, i am typing this right now and can't stop for about 00 more minutes, and second, i am trying that stupid oldfashioned stuff where you let the guy call you. The tv is on in here and i kind of want to change the channel because they are talking about Sept. 00th. That's so depressing and I think that I am depressed enough right now with all of this new stuff in my life. I liked my house and my room in my house and my town where i knew my way around and my tutoring job that payed well, and my cozy school where I have gone since kindergarten. I miss my mom and dad, and friends, but most of all I miss my dog! DID I TELL YOU THAT I MISS MY DOG, PROPNAME? She is the one who undepresses me. How can you be upset when she is begging for your approval and looking at you with that puppy dog face that is that is the ultimate model of pure love. Oh yeah- I just heard something about American Idol, that t. v. show. THe girl who won, PROPNAME PROPNAME, is from LOCNAME, a small towm outside of LOCNAME LOCNAME. That is where my boyfriend is from, which just brings me back to the fact that I miss PROPNAME right now. Now all i can think about is the fact that I am such a typical girl; all i can think about is my boyfriend! oh well, it's better tan thinking about the mean girls that i have to live with. They are so unthoughtful. My brother told me to live here and that i would meet some of my best friends for life here. Yeah right! I hate all of these girls. All of my friends live somewhere else. I pretty much always take his advise because he is really smart and after all, he is my big brother. But i think he was wron on this one. I guess I am finished. Yeah, i better get ready for dinner, but this is pretty addicting to write all of this down, even though none of this make any sense to you. Oh well, bye bye. 
__label__label1      No heather I did not put your picture up, I don't know why! No I didnt wash it. I really like Fight club, I don't know why, actually I do. Why did I even say i don't know why, itsd amazing the things you get use to saying so that you will fit in. Anyways, I am trying to meet people, and its cool. I use the xcuse that other people haven't been open and maybe they were not, but at the same time, I knowe I am not as openas I was last year. Ireally liked my senior year, it went by pretty fast, and I got to do alot of the things that I like to do and wanted to do. I also have really wanted to see my girlfriend and, yea, Im debating wether I want to stay at our status of going out exclusively, or whether or not, we should also see other people. Would marrying her be all that bad, maybe, or maybe Im just sexually attracted to her. I have been playing computer games alot and I have also been studying alot more. You know something that interesting, is that people are always looking forward to stuff and never enjoying the present. Do we ever really enjoy the present. Sex is cool in the present, and I guess you look forward to that and you also look forward to eating, so maybe we are more like animals than people think. Maybe we really arent that advanced. I wonder how much different we are from animals. Which brings me to evolution, evolution makes so much sense to me, doesn't it to you? Do i need peoples approval on everything?!! we are very gregarious creatures, how can therebe a GOD, how can there not be I don't know, but I doubt it alot of the time and take things that people might set aside as miracles as simply co incedence. I wonder if Im studying enouph, or is there such a thing. Do I just want to mak the grade or do I actually want to learn. I think knowing, I mean really remembering all that you study would be aswome. I think the coolest characters in story are highly intellegent. Like Grand adimeral thrawn, the most intelegent, incredibly intellegent bad guy. HE could wipe out whole civilizations and even galaxies, by simply outhinking them, by studying their psychological weaknesses and then exploiting them to take control of them, He did so by being incredibly knoledgeable on his subject matters. He knew something on every topic, and wasd therefor nearly undeafeatable, he didnt need to see the future, he could see it through their minds and the way they reacted to different sittuations. Are women evil, is all they care about is guys, I mean really what is there purpose in the grand scheme of things. All they ever do is complain, there is always something wrong with them, they only care about themselves, and they backstab each other all the time. They're frekin evil. They're all about appearences, nothing is as it seems with them, I mean what the hell is wrong with them, don't they have any loyalty towards each other, all they evercare to do is kill each other over. Are people only angry at the people like them, because they can see through them, they see what these similar people are doing, and hate that they exploit people the same way that they do. Is that all we do, exploit other people, is there such a thing as love. Or is it just made up, or is love just a selfish thing to benefit yourself. I mean I want to be unselfish and I want others to be unselfish, is that even possible. Is everyone like everyone else, are there any individuals, or is it just a giant struggle to be unique and cool. Why are we here, is there a purpose to this big mess, I mean what are we supposed to do, what is the purpose of having life if all you will have is eventuall death, why did life create itself, and how is it that your cells retain thoughts. I mean how do your cells keep your thoughts, I don't understand that. I mean how do they work together to keep your thoughts and memories. The brain is such an interesting thing and it is very amazing indeed, and I would like to know about everyone elses brain sooo I could, use that information, I would like to have as much knowledge as grand adimeral thrawn, but then again who would'nt isnt that interesting, how alike we really are, and that we are in deed a product of our parents enviroment. 
__label__label1 i feel really weird HAVING to write something. Pressure?  Yeah. My   dormmates   are so loud. I can hear the tv blaring through the door right now. They woke me up this morning (on several accounts. )  I have to get used to this (or they have to SHLOCNAME UP! :) )  my dad called right as I started this. I would really like to talk to him, but I turned my phone ORGNAMEf. Hopefully I can get through to him after I finish with this. I'm a really fast typer, this thing will probably be really long. Maybe I should slow it down some. I was really suprised that my dad called. I thought that I sent him a pretty nasty e-mail last night about paying for my books (i'm really just mad at him because he hasn't made the effort to come up and see me yet. )  but he sent me back another e-mail saying that he would give me the check for my books tomorrow. when he came up for lunch. Damn!  I hate it when he does that too me. Just when he fits the perfect category of a bastard father and I have a legitimate reason for hating him he pulls some shit like this. Also, looking back at my e-mail it wasn't nasty at all. Why can't I just tell him how I feel. It's a shame that no one in the Psych department is going to read this, because I'm sure that one could do some serious psycho-analysis on the way I feel about my father. I would really love to do research on girls from families where the father   abandoned   the family. See how they turned out in their romantic/sexual relationships, how they relate to other men. I know that I would probably be the perfect sterotypical   i don't have a daddy   girl. Insatiable sexual appetite, emotional codependency, needing to constantly be reassured that the ones I love most won't leave me. It makes me really sad what my dad has done to me. I don't think it's ever really angered me (i don't know that I've actually ever been REALLY angry at anything), but it makes me almost stiff with sadness. My roomate just walked in totally throwing my stream of consciousness off, but I think I was probably done with that thought anyway. I don't know what I'm going to do with my college education. There's just so much that I could see myself being really happy doing. I would love to go into print journalism (write for a newspaper or a magazine), psychology (what I talked about earlier), teaching (i don't know why. i just love kids and i feel that i'm a really good teacher), then there's politics. I could really see myself getting into a campaign. BUt last night I had a dream, so real that earlier today I couldn't remember whether it had really been a dream that I just HAD to get into the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. I wonder if that holds any weight to what I really want to do. HOw logical does it sound to make a career descision on a dream?  Some might say that it's very logical, like PROPNAME. I love her so much. I remember when I was a freshman in high school and brainwashed by ORGNAME, and we would get into these huge religious debates. Now I think that there may be more truth to what she thinks than what I believed. I miss her and LOCNAME so much that it hurts. I'm cryng now just thinking about it. After the divorce, we became a unit. NOw I can't help but feel that that unit is slowing crumbling. I miss how LOCNAME would always make me laugh. He's so goofy. I remember when football was on he would pile up thed cushions from the sofa and dive into them. I feel like a little piece of me has died, even though he's only 0 0/0 hours away. Who is this close to their brother?  But, Mom was never home and for the past 0 years I've kind of raised him. I remember when he and I would commisserate about how much he and I hated PROPNAME. I feel realy bad for not being able to get ahold of her before I left. I guess I probably could have tried harder. That's my problem. I get so close to being a good person, or being a sociable person as is the case at school, but I never follow through with what I say I will. I wonder if that has anything to do with Dad never doing the same thing?  I am so excited about American Idol coming on tonight. LEss than 0 hours. I really hope that PROPNAME winds. I miss PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I'm not really sure that she wants me as her bridesmaid, or if she's just doing it because PROPNAME asked PROPNAME to be his groomsman. When I call them she never seems to want to talk to me. Oh well, she asked me and there's nothing that she can do about it now. Well, I guess there is. I want to get married. To PROPNAME. And I want to raise a family. I want a dog. I want to be happy. I want to watch our 0 kids grow up and have kids of their own. I would really love to be in LOCNAME with him right now. I wish that I could life the UT campus and set it back down in LOCNAME. I mean, I love UT but I hate having to be so far from PROPNAME. It was really fun this weekend staying with him. I do feel really bad about giving that guy my number. he called last night and he talks as if he was really slow. oh well. i know i won't follow up on it. and why would i?  i'm in a very serious, very committed relationship. and i love richard very very much. i really believe that he is my soulmate 
__label__label0 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME. Right now i am feeling extremely uneasy. Lately I have been stressing out about everything, from school work to social matters. For instance, this week i have some type of homework due everday this week starting Wednesday. Last night I worked for five hours straight on homework. I had to make myself take a break and go to Kin's Corner and eat because I hadn't eaten lunch or dinner, there simply just wasnt enough time. Anyway on Wednesday I have this huge english rough draft due and the final paper is due on Friday. I have a Geology test at 0 in the morning on Thursday, and I do not work well in the mornings, especially when I am stressed. I try to run in the PROPNAME gym to take some of the pressure off me and it helps a little. I just get on the treadmill and go. thinking and making plans for the week and how I can manage my time wisely. I keep thinking that once the weekend comes, I will be okay. I'm going home to visit my family and friends and all my worries will be left here in LOCNAME. That scares me a little because I'm afraid I will be dreading coming back here because LOCNAME is my home now. That's another thing that gives me a little anxiety. Right now I don't really feel that i have a home per say. I know that I am always welcome in LOCNAME (my hometown) but I have a hard time considering it my actual home. Kinsolving is my new residence but i feel uncomfortable calling it my actual home. I guess I just have to get used to it. Even though i feel anxiety about this small issue, I do not feel much   homesickness   that freshman are supposed to feel for their parents and friends. I do miss them a lot but I have not been upset by the fact that they are not going to be around me for support or whatever I might need from them. I guess in a way I am really enjoying my independence. I was scared before I came here and i realize now that I am okay alone. There are a lot of times that I need to be with people and socialize but leaving my comfort zone is the best thing that I could have ever done. I have discovered so many things about myself that I didnt know I even had in me, such as my need for independence. Right now my roommate just walked in. Most people I have talked to tell me that they have spent about two hours with their roommate. I do almost everything withe mine. She is my best friend here. We think alot alike. Our room is just the way we wanted it, if not better. There are 00 posters of famous celebrities like PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME. Our room smells of perfume cause we both spray it non stop, not because it smells bad but because. well I'm not exactly sure why. My mind is going blank. thinking. okay there is no air condition in our room or if there is, it is extremely hot in here and we have a fan blowing ALL the time. I live in supplemental housing so this isn't an actual dorm room-I think it is some kind of storage room-but in any case, I like it here. It feels cozy besides the temperature. Im thinking that if I still live here in the winter, I will be okay because it's always hot in here. who knows?!  Anyway I am extremely tired, it is so hard making myself get up in the morning and go to class. The only reason I get up every morning is because I'm so afraid that I am going to fall behind. Actually, I feel that I am always behind. I do not procrastinate, or at least I try not to, but there's just something inside me that makes me feel that there is always something that needs to be done and I cannot slip up and get caught behind. I always leave extra early for things just so I will not be late. I have a math class right after my rhetoric and composition class, which is all the way across campus. I am always late for my math class and it bothers me so much. It scares me to miss the first few minutes of that class because I might have missed some important information like homework or some change in the schedule. I guess you could call it paranoia, I don't know. Well, I think that since I've always been this way, I work well under pressure. I don't really like it but, but I'm so used to it. Maybe that's a good thing coming to a big university. Time's up!!        
__label__label1     I am so nervous about what I got on my economics test. I know that I spent a long time studying, but I will be very upset if I don't get at least a B. I can't wait till next weekend when I get to go to LOCNAME to visit PROPNAME. I hope that the Chili Cookoff will be fun. It sounds like it will be entertaining. I am upset that I am not going to get to PROPNAME, though. I wish I could go to LOCNAME this weekend, but I have two tests on Monday. I am so stressed out about those test. I am going to spend a lot of this weekend studying. After I get those test out of the way I need to spend a lot of time on my english paper. I feel like I can never get caught up. I am looking forward to the ORGNAME ORGNAME mixer tongiht. I hope that I can meet some really nice guys. Actually, I don't care if I meet nice guys or not, I am just looking forward towards getting to go out. Lately I feel like all I ever do is study. College is so much more stressful than high school because you don't know what to expect. I am not sure if I am studying enough. At least I will be able to tell after I receive my grades from all of these tests. I am so tired. I wish I could take a nap. Hopefully after class I will have time to eat, workout, and take a nap. I am really upset that I haven't had much time to work out lately. When I was in high school I had cheerleading practice everyday. I was always working out. Now the only thing my body is use to is walking around to all my classes. It makes me feel so out of shape. PROPNAME PROPNAME is the best. I am listening to her CD right now. I had so much fun at her concert. It was weird to actually see her in person. I am so glad that I have been understanding my Calculus lately. At first I was worried that I was going to have to drop the class. I am glad that I decided to stick with it, because now it isn't so bad. The only part that sucks is the homework. It takes forever to do because the questions are so tedious. I am really nervous about completeing the test in 00 minutes. I can barely do one problem in 00. Hopefully they won't be as hard as the homework problems. I am praying that they are a lot more general. I hope that PROPNAME and I have time to talk tonight. It seems like I am always busy with ORGNAME new member functions and he is always busy with his rush stuff. It will be  a good thing for me to be able to see him. I need to figure out which airport to fly out of. I hope the planes aren't really full, or else I won't be able to go because I fly stand by. I hate flying stand by. It is such a pain. You have to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your plane even departs. I don't know why I am complaining. It is a lot better to fly than to drive. Once I drove to LOCNAME from my hometown, LOCNAME. It seemed never ending. Plus the scenery was not very visually pleasing. At least I was riding with PROPNAME, my best friend. We kept each other occupied. That was so funny when we both started singing that one song. We could not stop laughing. Another reason I don't like driving is because it takes up time that I could be doing other things. At least when I fly I can read, do homework or even sleep. When  I am driving I have to concentrate the whole time. I need to go over to the business school today before five. I need to change my passion panel registration times. I am so frustrated with that whole system. I wish I could just get in the ones I wanted. 
__label__label0      I am afraid of being here. I think that I am not smart enough or that I just don't have what it takes. I think about my boyfreind alot! he is my bestfriend. Sometimes I feel like I can't live without him. I hate feeling that way but i can't help it. my biology class is stupid. i hate sitting there for an hour and a half wondering what the heck she is talking about. i wonder what my mom is doing right now. my little sister is in school right now and is probably having way more fun than i am. i can't wait until october 0th it is going to be great. i get to finally see my boyfriend again after 0 months. gosh that seems like a long time. i wonder if he is thinking of me right now. i know he better have wrote a letter on sunday. i love getting his letters. they make me feel very happy and i read them over and over and over. sometimes i don't knwo if i am just kidding myself about our relationship but then i remember how much i miss him and how perfect we are together. is there actually soemthing out in the universe that is perfect?  is there some object that can meet standards that to majority is perfect?  i know i am not perfect. i am so nervous about gaining weight. i always watch what i eat but it always like too much no matter what i eat. i hate feeling that wat too. i love beanie babies. they are soo cute. i used to collect them but now I dont. not that its because i got older but just because i don't have the money to spend on them anymore. I wonder why people are the way they are. Some people can be soo mean but have no reason to be that way. I wonder if I am that way. I wonder if people see me as snobby or dumb. I always look around the room and i wonder if people are just as confused as me. I try to look as if i am not confused but i don't think it works to much. I want to move with my boyfriend. I want to be near him alwyas. I always think about him. Is that unhealthy?  I like pizza. it is vrey good i want pizza now. i love fruit too. i think fruit can be better than icecream although i love icecream too. if i had to choose right now i would eat a peach. i don't know why but tomorow i would probably eat icecream. I don't think that i fit into this city. i think sometimes that maybe i shoould have stayed in killen. i love music i have to listen to it in order to make my day start out good. i love dirty south music but then again i love all kinds of music. how can someone only like certain types of music?  i don't believ e that. they make themselves think that. I think that music is a form of expression and you should listen to the music before saying  what is that,country?     ewwww!    I love anything that makes me feel good inside. I kind of would like to move to florida. my friend PROPNAME lives there but i went there for a band trip and i had such a good time. i was with my boyfriend and we did everything. evreybody told us that they sat around. we went on every ride there was. then before my boyfriend left to the navy we went to LOCNAME LOCNAME. we went there all by our selves and did everything our way. no one  to tell us what to do or how to do it. it was great. We saved all our money and made sure we had enough to spend. I loved the shows at sea world. My favorite was fools with tools and how they made fun of all the other shows. It was great. There too me and my boyfriend went to every show and eveyr ride although there werent much rides. I hope we don't have to read our papers infront of the class. I don't think i did my paper right. What if i sound stupid?  oh well, i am probably not the only one that thinks that. i am not sure if i am going to switch my major becaus psychology is soemthing that i have always wanted to learn. my highschool teacher was soo cool. I loved visiting the LOCNAME LOCNAME hospital. It was so fascinating how those people could actually think those ways and believe everything they feel. I kind of felt sorry for some of them too. I don't know how to feel when it comes to people that are disabled, shoudl I feel sorry or luck to know them? 
__label__label1      My roommate just asked me if I have any homework due tomorrow and I don't but yet I still feel as if I need to be reading or studying gor something. I'm afraid I'm doing what I sould be doing, what everybody else is doing, studying. I feel as if my classes aren't hard. I also feel as if everyone knows what they want to do in life and I have no clue. I feel so ashamed that I don't know. Before I came to college, I knew what I wanted to be and do so I was going to come here and work for that goal. I would rather do nothing else but be a teacher. I want to teach so much but there is absolutely no money in it. And thats terrible because teachers can be so influencial. I have had several teachers that have been awesome and make me want to teach even more. I want to help and to influence and to have that feeling that I was a part in that student's recieving and A on a test or a paper. I would want to teach either a math class or biology for highschool students. I was always tutoring and helping my friends or anyone that needed help and I enjoyed it so much. I graduated in a whole year early to get out of highschool. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time in highschool but it was time for me to leave. It was time to start my life. I am in a hurry to grow up, I'm tired of being young. I feel as if I've been the youngest in everything. I was the youngest one at all my family reunions, I was the youngest model. Yeah, I model. It goes on like that for a lot of things. And now I'm the youngest in college, its seems anyway. I graduated early for lots of reasons. Everyone asks me what made me decide to do it and I never really go in to it because I din't like to tell people my sob stories unless I trust them or they know my background. But since I have to write for 00 minutes, I'll tell you. It all got started when my parents got divorced when I was in 0th grade. I really feel as if I had the perfect life if thats even possible. Both my parents got remarried to other people within a year of their divorce. I went through a really hard time then, and I know its completely cliche but I would love it if they got back together. I think they're perfect together. The woman my dad married was a complete idiot. I mean, its sad being 00 times smarter than someone twice your age. But now they're divorced, my dad just wasn't happy with her. I'm happy she's out of the picture. The man my mom married is a big reason I graduated early. I loathe and despise him with a burning passion. I know its immature and selfish, but I will go out of my way to be a bitch to him. I think he's a horrible, miserable man and is completely wrong for my mom. A lot of people say, no youjust don't like him because he's not your dad, blah blah blah. But then they meet him and understand exactly what I mean. I think my mom was a little selfish when I she decided to bring this man into our lives knowing no one liked him. I have this wierd ability to pick out people I know are not good people. My parents had this friend who I hated since I was a little girl, the first day I met him. Later, when I grew up i find out he was a big cocain addict and was always calling my parents to pick him from jail or get him out of whatever mess he got himeself into. I never liked him. I get the same feeling with my step father. I don't even like calling him. I usually refer to him as my mom's husband. I feel so bad about leaving my little brother. He's 0 years old. I hate to leave him with at home with no one to defend him against my step dad. I always stood up for him shen PROPNAME, thats my stepdad's name, would be rediculously rude for no reason. There's sometimes when my mom would step in and say something. My real dad is there, always around doing things with us, don't get me wrong. I have the greatest dad. I feel sorry because my dad is not onw for being alone and I think he's very lonely right now. Especially not that I'm gone, thats one less child for him to be with. I have an older brother too who goes to school at LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. He's kind of lonely there right now and he's thinking about coming home and going to school in LOCNAME. I love texas, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.    
__label__label1 Hmm. writing assignment in psychology class. And here I was thinking that this class would be fun and exciting and relaxing, EXCLUDING any sort of writing assignment like the history or english classes. Man I am making so many mistakes as I type, I couldn't possibly be nervous I know that for sure. Oh look, what do you know, only about 0 minute and 00 seconds have gone by; I really don't know if I can keep this up for another 00 minutes or so. I wonder if grammar actually counts, not like I would receive any points on it if I wrote it any slower with a timer right on top of me anyway. Hmm. think I will go back and read this message before I continue any longer. But, I guess that would kind of defy the purpose of writing in a stream of consciousness manner. Stream of consciousness, that term reminds me of my humanities class in 0th and 00th grade. It definitely reminds of PROPNAME PROPNAME, the author of Ulysses who attempted to write an ENTIRE BOOK based on the method of stream of consciousness. Man that was quite painful to read, since he didn't use ANY SORT OF PUNCTUATIONS AT ALL. Maybe I'm not supposed to be using any punctuations either. I wonder if I'm destroying the purpose of this experiment. Writing this makes me wonder, can this REALLY be stream of consciousness? There had to have been some premeditation involved one point of another. I'm beginning to feel like my thoughts are premeditated as well. Heck, whatever gets me the credit and grades for this class. Dr. PROPNAME is one hilarious person, good at making fun of people. There is nothing better than public humiliation of individuals who like to stand out among his or her classmates. It is always a good laugh. Well, Friday's almost here, that means another week of my completely wasted college life has gone by. At least I get to go home for this weekend, I'm really sick of consuming the heinously disgusting American food at the Jester buffet or city limits. I'm actually going home for business training. Since I am an independent business owner, I should probably learn some management skills and as well as how to expand all the assets that I have. Speaking of assets, I just recently learned the importance of being able to distinguish between what exactly is an asset and a liability. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a very, very intelligent man. I guess why he's the multi-millioinaire and I'm not. Oh well, maybe I'll get to his place someday with the help of my friend. Weird, what was I thinking. I could've sworn I was talkin about goin back home for business training earlier. I guess this is what stream of consciousness is all about huh. Man, it seems like it's been forever, but only 00 minutes has gone by. Speaking of time, it reminds me of the different theories that people have developed over their life time. Some people thinks the time goes by faster if they stare at the clock. Personally, I think the clock goes by so much quicker if I'm not constantly staring at it all the time. I wonder how many spelling mistakes I've failed to correct in this writing assignment, oh well. Back to the business training, I hope the ninety dollars were well spent. I really hope that BWW has put together somethin good this year, something that all the BWW/QUIXTAR-Affiliated Independent Business Owner can benefit from. Man that was a pain to type, I probably should've just typed BWW/QUIXTAR IBO's for that matter. Anyways, most of my friends don't seem to believe in the business that I'm participating in, well actually, owning. I don't really get any respect from them at all, and sometimes I really wonder why that is. The only thing I'm waiting to do now is being able to handle my business correctly, expand it large enough so I'll have multi-million dollar returns. And then I think I'm going to come back and laugh at all of the people that has disparaged the activity I was involved in. Even better, the stupid electrical engineers that I call friends can work for me in the future. Just as PROPNAME PROPNAME says,   an intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are to work for them.  I will be able to prove myself one day. Being able to beat them down is probably the only drive or motivation that exists in my life. Besides PROPNAME of course, she is the love of my life. Without her, I don't think I would've sanely passed through the toughest times of my life. I'm really hoping to get married to her one day, and make her the happiest woman on the face of this planet by providing her with everything that I possibly can. Looks like I better get rich quick. But, I doubt she's interested in me being rich, I truly believe that she's with me today because it was her choice. She's not the type of person that would regret any decisions she has made in the field of love and relationships, which is something I really respect. She always gives her all, always tries to put on a smile just for me even though she may be having the worst day of her life. I'm so lucky that I've found her, and I'm willing to treasure this relationship for the rest of my life. I cannot really express my love for her in words, nor in sentences, maybe not even an essay of this length. All I can pray for is that someday, she will be able to touch my heart with her hands and fully understands the kind of appreciation that resides within the innermost side of my heart. I thank God everyday for all the things He has bestowed upon me. Of course, besides eternal life, Daisy is the next greatest gift that I have ever received. Oh look, time's up, bye! 
__label__label1      I'm super tired but I don't think i'll be able to sleep. I have a lot of reading to do too but I'm afraid I'll fall asleep if I crack open a book. I'm really wanting some candy right now but I already ate a huge dinner and I don't really need anything else. If you eat 0 hours before you go to bed it makes you fat so I shouldn't eat anything now. ER's on and I hate that show it's super cheesey and unreal.  Now Will and Grace is on and that's very funny. My younger brother just came out of the closet this summer so I watch it from a different view point now. He's only 00 and I'm wondering if he knows for sure that he's gay. I worry about him, I'm already super protective of him and this just makes me even paranoid about him because it's already such a crazy world out there and being in the gay community just makes it crazier. There are girls being loud outside my door, I don't really know anyone in my hall since this is my second year to live in the dorm I haven't really made any effort to meet anyone, neither has my roomate, we're justy very apathetic towards the whole dorm life now. I need to call my friends in a little bit and see what they're doing tonight anbd then decide if I should go out with them or not. I can read tomorrow during work, but that never seems to happen on Fridays. I also really need to work on my packet for spirits and figure out what project I'm going to do for it. I'm not sure if that's even really my thing. I was very involved all throughout highschool, but now I'm kindof worn out of all that stuff, and I would hate it if it turned out to be similar to a sorority because I hat ethat kind of stuff, it's so fake and i HAVeenough friends without having to pay for them. My roomate and best friend rushed this year but she didn't make it and I'm actually pretty relieved because it would have really changed her and I'd probably never have seen her anymore.  
__label__label1 I am thinking about calculus. I wish I could be working on Calculus instead of doing this assignment. I wonder if I am doing this assignment correctly. Do we need to write about what exactly we are thinking, or in question/sentence format. Well I made a decision at the very beginning to write it in sentence format because that is how I have been taught to write at school for so long. I am hungry. I should have made prepared something in the oven, so when I am done with this assignment I would be able to eat it. Now I have started so I must suffer the consequences and be hungry for twenty, or approximately 00 more minutes. I am thinking about what the purpose of this assigment is. I guess it is so you will think about what you are thinking. I want to type things in here as if I was talking to someone, but then again I quickly remember that I am supposed to be writing my stream of consciousness. How fast should I be typing. Should I think about it, then type it, or think about it as I am typing it, or is it a combination of both. Today, I have thought so much about thinking. A new concept entered my mind last night and it is pretty incredible. I can actually get a better grip on my thoughts and thus I am better able to control what I am thinking. This is good because the more control of yourself you have, the more control of every situation you are put in you can then have also. I think that sentence did not make much sense but I know that I know what I am talking about. I am still really hungry. I wonder how many minutes I have to go. Oh, its at the top of the screen, so far I have completed 0 minutes. What else is there to talk about?  I don'e exactly know what Im thinking about right now. wait. ok. . I think I am thinking too hard. Well what would you like me to write about. what I think about really depends on what I am trying to think about. and thinking about thinking seems like it leaves my mind blank. But then again, it is not blank at all. I feel like today was a great day. Everyday that I am alive is a great day. I also think that I worry too much, but when I worry less I have time to think about the things that really matter. But what really matters?  I am soooooooooo hungry. I only have 0 more minutes to go. This writing assignment has to be one of the easiest, requires alot less effort , than most writing assignments. But this assignment is different from all the rest in the fact that I am actually starting to see how this (thinking/ stream of consciousness) works. Once I master it, I feel like I will have accomplished one of the hardest challenges in the world. to find one's self. Ok. . now my stomach is growling. I will be so happy when today is over and I get to lay my head to rest. I am going to appreciate sleeping alot more now that I think about it. It really not only gives your body a break but it also gives your mind a break. Today I feel like my mind has been in overdrive. I have had at least three people tell me I am deep, and I met alot more people today. User's guide. this book sitting right in front of me. I guess I took a break in thinking, and that is what I saw. I am so tired. physically, mentally. I have not pushed myself as much as I did today, and somehow I know it will be for the better. I am so glad that my parent's pushed me to go to college. I think it is an absolutely great/priceless experience that everyone owe's to themselves. Knowledge is power, knowledge about one's self and knowledge about the world are two great tools when your digging through that thing called life. I love that college has brought to my attention some ideas that would have never crossed my mind prior. Well I just looked at the time again and I have approximately 00 more seconds. I ho 
__label__label0      Today is the anniversary of the attack on the twin towers. i havent been thinking about this all day, images or feelings appear or become evident now and then. I sometimes feel very emotional to the point where my eyes my moisten up, and sometimes I feel a bit angry or nervous, thinking about what the world is coming to. We aren't safe anymore, at least the way we were before the 00th. I mean the nice safe world I lived in two years ago was a comfortable one. I didn't doubt the future of humanity, our country, or our safety. Now, I occasionally do doubt. And most of all, thinking about the 00th and how there seems to be evident hate, extreme hate, towards LOCNAME, I am angry at the world, at people, I don't know who in particular just angry, that this the world my sister, who is 0 will grow up in. She is a very close part of me, I feel very close and love her very much. She's my   little sis.   And to think that she now has to deal with these new realities of the world and people and her country some day, is sad to me. I mean on ond hand I am thinking come on, nothing drastic is going to happen, you live in LOCNAME far from the events, far from danger, she will be fine, I will be fine. And then I get this sense of coumminty and how we are all in this together and how I am American and she is American and we are hated by people who have the power to kill many people, to infiltrate our country and live among us without recognition. this is bad. PROPNAME is her name, and she is so adorable, smart, funny, I would be devistated if anything happened to her, I would feel terrible if she felt scared or hopeless about the new world once she realizes what has happened. I feel that it's partially my responsibility to be there for her and educate her of the events and of the new ideologies that Americans have adopted. I am responsible to help her through these events these new realities as much as I can because I do not want her to fear life. I want so much the perfect, safe, comfortable world I grew up in to be the world she will grow up in, but I face the facts and realize that it most likely will not be. I find myself still in this private world of disbelief or like I am alternating bewteen a world where I realize the new threats involved with LOCNAME and the possibility of war. Just recently, I started paying close attention to the news coverage of PROPNAME PROPNAME and his disregard to ORGNAME weapons inspections and how he is a tangible threat to our security. Realizing this, going to war is more of a possibility in my mind. I relize the seriousness of the LOCNAME conflict, the seriousness of the 00th events, terrorists and all that now more than ever. Maybe because I am older or am paying closer attention to the news, reading more articles in newspapers. Nevertheless, I am bothered by this whole change in our world. I have a lot of homework to do, a girlfriend, tuition and bills to pay, a career to study for, I have plans of becoming a doctor one day and I have just recently realized how much work that is going to be. I never anticipated this much stress or responsibilities in college. I am 00, should this much stuff be present in my life?  You know, I heard Amazing Grace today played at one of the memorial ceremonies on TV tonight and was emotionally moved. That song always does that to me. It can played on the trumpet, piano, organ, or bagpipes-it doenst matter, it always gets to me. I wonder what it is about that song that moves me so much. That was the first song I ever played on the piano and trumpet if I am remembering correctly. I miss my parents, mostly my little sister. I am going back this weekend, but I am starting to contemplate whether or not that is a good idea because I have mcuh homework to finish. I guess thats another struggles I am dealing with in my life currently. I started thinking about how much I love my grandparents. They live right up a little path from our house in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I realized that they will not be on this earth for too much longer. I would see them all the time growing up and even through high school. Now I rarely ever see them because I am in college. I will, hopefully, have years and years after their deaths to study or do whatever, is it wise and the best thing for me to miss out on the time I have now to spend with them?  Is spending time in college worth the sacrifice I am making. Why can't I spend as much time with them as possible now when we are here on earth together before they pass on. 
__label__label1      I was fairly apprehensive about beginning this assignment, as it is my first official college homework. I'm a little worried that I won't be able to fill the entire twenty minutes with my thoughts, however I've never had a lack of thought before, never been at a loss of something interesting or intriguing to ponder or speak about. However, I've also never been asked to trace my stream of thought for twenty minutes. Right now I'm feeling pretty tired ORGNAME I guess a little thirsty. But I guess that's life. Life is also a board game by ORGNAME ORGNAME, you know, the one where you buy 'House Insurace'. Life is sitting at my computer completing an assignment for one of my classes. Life can be a many number of things, such as a pony ride in LOCNAME, a state I've been to once to see PROPNAME's birthplace but have no desire to return to. PROPNAME was our 00th president, something I remember from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was the best class I ever took in highschool. I haven't been on a pony ride in years. The girl across the hall from me in my dorm used to train horses though, and she talks of them semi-frequently. My roomate does a lot of studying. I'd say upwards of six or seven hours each day. It makes me feel guilty that I am not always making the best use of my time, but I figure that's what college is about. Not specifically wasting time however, because it in itself is definately not a waste. I'm almost done with classes for the week, just a philosophy discussion section tomorrow from 0-0. It's nice to only have one class on fridays, however I am disappointed that I got assigned that scetion. A 0-day weekend each week would be much appreciated, which I suppose goes without saying. My boyfriend is coming into town this weekend, which is nice. He attends the ORGNAME ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME (ORGNAME ORGNAME). Most people are shocked to dicover that I'm dating an Aggie. I guess I just haven't become a die-hard Longhorn fan, as of yet anyway, although I know I will never sever a relationship (as some people think I most definately should) over school pride and - or rivalry. I will however attend the UT/A&M game and probably wear orange. I will also eat some yogurt and get a lemonade as soon as these four minutes are up. I need to put some more of my photos up in my room. My roommate has put some up. They're small PROPNAME PROPNAME prints, which is my favorite. I'm pretty passionate about art, I did a lot of reading this summer on the history and pecific time periods of western art. However, my roommate just put them up for their aesthetic value. Oh well, you can't win them all. Most though, anyway.      
__label__label1  The past week I have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. I am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. I so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason I keep holding myself back. This frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. My presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. I'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. I really don't think that it's me. My suitemate is about to push me over the edge. She never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. For example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. On most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. She just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. She is from LOCNAME LOCNAME. Im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. Typical if you ask me. I just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. On top of that, I am homesick. I miss my friends. I miss being with PROPNAME. He'll call me once and a while. Usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then I won't hear from him for quite a while. I get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. That makes me so mad. My roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. It just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. Sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but I know that he cares about me. If he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. Its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. It really makes me wonder why she is the one person I confide in the most. Speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom I adore as a friend. He is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. I turn around and he is always there. I never get to sleep in my own room, I am constantly forgotten about or simply not included in activities that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. I find it ironic that she gets mad at me when I talk to PROPNAME, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when I make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. It doesn't seem all that fair to me. But then again, what is fair?  Is it fair that I want to be with someone that I can't have anymore? No its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. Sometimes I wonder if I will ever get a break; If maybe one day I'll get lucky and things will turn out the way I wanted them to, or if maybe PROPNAME will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. Sometimes I wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. She and I couldn't possibly be more different than we are. I can't even believe that I am her child sometimes. She acts so much like a child. If she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. She denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. I think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. I want to tell her how I feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that I need. She always used to do that in high school. If I told her what was on my mind, she would take away my car, or my privileges to stay out late. I can never win. Its either   give up my priviliges   or keep my mouth shut. It is a lose lose situation. I just miss PROPNAME so much. That could be the root of all my unhappiness. My mom, and suitemate could all just be elements of my sadness due to my distance away from him. He called me today. Ironically I was lying in bed thinking about him, when the phone rang. It felt so good to see his name on my cell phone when i looked at it.   
__label__label1      Today is a very stressful day, I just studied for the first time and it makes me so mad because i am a perfectionist and when I don't understand something perfectly I get really frusterated. My boyfriend from back home has not called today because we broke up last night and it was for the stupidist reason. Why can't he just let me do what I want? I'm kind of homesick lately. People know all their friends from high school and I'm just alone from LOCNAME, besides PROPNAME who is not being very nice lately. Well actually it's me not being very nice. It's really weird because my friends and I all have birthdays this week. Mine's on September 00th and it's not going to be a very fun birthday. It never really is. Two years ago my party got crashed by PROPNAME and then last year it was 0-00. Hopefully it'll be really cool though with everybody remebering 0-00. I think it will. The fact that I have so many classes that day kind of sucks though. Oh well I think I've officially decided that I'm changing my birthday to september 00th. My friends and I are all going to Hardrock cafe that night to eat and then we might go to sixth street and party afterward. I called my mom today just to chat and of course she makes me mad and says basically that her and my dad thought I was going to drop out of school. They wanted to make sure that I had been studying. they don't realize that I am on my own now and that I can deal with my own problems myself. PROPNAME and I just found this new diet. You eat a lot of fruit in the morning and veggies and then at night you can feast and eat whatever you want. You have to eat in a certain order though at night. kind of weird and who knows if it will work but it better because I'm not going to gain the freshman fifteen. Thats going to be hard because the cafeteria food is so damn good and you can keep on going up for more servings. I palyed on a soccer team today. Our dorm got a coed team together and we all went to practice together. It was a good workout because it was so hot out. It was alot of fun, I scored three goals and I broke PROPNAME' toe. OOPs! I feel kind of bad. I hate the fact that the last 0 weeks all I've been doing is having fun and not dealing with school. Now I realized that there's going to be alot of school wrk involved. I also want to prove my mom wrong and get a really good GPA. I set goqals for myself today because I was reading a book at   LOCNAME and Noble and I said that I was going to do good in school and study at least an hour a night. Hopefully I can do that. I think I will be able to. I can't believe that PROPNAME hasn't called yet. I either thought he'd call at 00am or not at all. Oh well there's more out there. I am having a lot of fun here though, so I don't really care if we break up.   
__label__label1 I just got out of rugby practice. this is the first practice we have had with the veteran players. my body hurts and for some reason I can't sleep so i decided to do this. im too excited to do anything, but think about the next practice. it reminds me of playing soccer in highschool. we should have won state my sophomore year. we had the most talented team i had ever seen at that level. two of the players from that year actually play in the mls. I love rugby. I was never a very imposing guy until about my junior year of highschool and by that time it was too late to play football. so i kept playing soccer. but i've always wanted to just level the other team, and now I can do that. I missed biology this morning because is et my alarm for 0:00 pm instead of 0:00 am. I hate when i do things like that. I miss summer school at LOCNAME. It was so much more fun than the fall. Everyone hung out together, and we could all get in to any party no matter if we were rushing or not. Now I'm lucky if I see one of the people from summer just once a week. Fall was suppose to be better. A girl that was my best friend in highschool, and I am absolutely in love with is here now. we have been here about two and a half weeks and we have only spent time together once. All she cares about is her sorority. And when we did hang out all she did was talk about how she was   tired of dealing with it.   Why doesn't she quit?  What is her obsession with being a part of something?  I just wish that we were growing closer like we thought we would in college. Instead we are moving further and further apart. Every guy she meets ends up asking her out on a date. She always some how avoids it, and I don't know why. Suddenly, a guy with plans for a very successful career seems much more attarctive than just a regular guy that wants to have fun and hang out. I can't believe i just wrote that because I am one of those guys with plans for a successful career. Maybe thats not what she is looking for at all. She lives seven floors below me but instead of coming up to say hi, she just calls. We talk two or three times a day, and when we see eachother we always give eachother subtle compliments. She is the one person who can always make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I'm in. I guess thats what being best friends for five years will do to you. I never knew I thought about her as much as I do. I think I'll go and see 
__label__label0      My nose is really stuffy right now and I had a fever earlier today but I think it's gone now. I hate not being able to breathe. I can hear the television right now. There's a commercial about honey barbecue wings. I can also hear my room mate typing and clicking her mouse. It's really cold in my room. I'm glad I decided to put my sweater on or I would be extremely cold. I can't really smell anything because of my stuffy nose. My stomach is growling. I have a craving for pizza. Maybe I'll go get some as soon as I finish this assignment. My room mate seems to be frustrated right now. I just heard her sigh. She has a test tomorrow that she needs to study for. She is mad because we weren't able to get football tickets for the OU game in LOCNAME. I kind of wanted to go and was getting excited about going to it. The television just mentioned something about getting pizza. Now my craving for it is increasing. I can taste it now. It's hard to type for 00 minutes straight. The phone just started ringing and distracted my train of thought for a while. My room mate just left the room to go open the door. I can watch the television from where I am sitting in front of my computer. My room mate's brother just walked in. Now all I can think about is what he is saying and I can't arrange my thoughts now. I just gave my room mate's brother my graphing calculator and showed him how to use it. I can't think of what to type any more. I am quickly running out of ideas. Time is passing really slowly. Typing for 00 minutes is really hard. My room mate is still talking about the OU football tickets. She is getting rid of her wristband and now I am thinking how I need to take mine off too. What other homework do I have?  I don't feel like going to my calculus class tomorrow. It is the most boring class I have because all we do is work out problems. I should go to the discussion session today, but I would rather go shopping with my friend. I keep sniffing. I still wish I could breathe. I think that not being able to breathe is the most annoying thing in the world. I feel as though I want to chop off my nose just so I don't have to feel congested any longer. Is this feeling normal?  Wanting to chop off my nose?  Everytime I get congested I feel the exact same way. Now I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me for wanting to chop off my nose. Oh well, I bet it is a perfectly normal feeling when you are sick and frustrated. I wonder what caused me to become congested. I heard that a lot of people have been sick today. Maybe something is going around. I always get sick. I have the worst immune system. My stomach keeps growling, but I am not sure if I want to eat because I feel as though I shouldn't eat because I want to lose weight although all my friends say that I am crazy for feeling this way. They keep telling me that I am perfectly fine the way I am. I still don't believe them because they don't see what I see in the mirror everyday. I've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees. But isn't that true for a lot of people?  Don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. What isn't normal though is acting upon it. Oh well. I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial. I can't think of what to type again. I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. My room mate just laughed. I wonder why she laughed. I can hear the people out in the hallway. These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside. The refrigerator noise is really annoying. It's so loud. I feel sick still. I just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. I never get enough sleep. I always end up staying up really late and then I feel dead in the morning. My foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. I have the worst circulation in the world. Why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position I put them in. I think it has to do with the fact that I don't get the proper nutrients. My hands are starting to get tired now. I can't wait until I am finished typing. I have about 0 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 00 minutes consecutively. I wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. I bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than I can. Oh well so much for that because it's too late now to start typing faster. I could try but then it would just seem pointless. My contacts are getting dry and it's getting hard to see the screen. I hate sitting at my desk and now my arms are starting to hurt because they are in a weird position. I am almost finished now and almost time to stop. The window just appeared saying that I am finished now and I can stop typing. 
__label__label0 This will be an interesting writing assignment, especially fro you readers. Typing out my stream of conciousness thoughts is not exactly something I'm familar with, as you may notice through all my misspellings and everything else you'll notice wrong with my paper. I'm listening ti the Lord of the Rings soundtrack right now, and my room is freezing!!  LOCNAME, even if the rooms are spacious and it's in a convient location, had the most frigid, uncomfterabel environment to live in. Half the time I walk around bundled in every layer of clothes I can find-- I feel liek an Eskimo!!  of course I wouldn't be in my room so much if things at LOCNAME were going a little better. Sorry, usually I'm not a whiner, but this past week has been extraordinarily rough. I feel like I don't know anyone, which I don't, and sometimes I 'll go through whole days on just a couple of words spoken to my room mate. A feeling of total isolation isn't exactly the easiest to deal with. I'm usually a pretty social person, actually, i just have trouble meeting the people. However, once I get to know them, I 'll open right up. Yep, I'm an oyster or something--once you get 'em open. My parents haven't called me, which is only a little troubling. I thought most parents wre supposed to hang off onto their child's every footstep as they walked out of the nest to college. My sister has called me a couple of times and actually planned a visit, which I am definitely looking foward to. So, instead of going out with friends or talking to people that care about me, I do my homework. I must be the most ahead inmy studies of any student at LOCNAME. Spanish is actually the hardest class for me right now, and probably the least interesting (which might contribute to the hardness factor). Philosophy, LOCNAME and Psychology are definitely tied for most interesting class of the semester award. I knew I loved English, suspected I'd enjoy the biology and problem-solving of Psychology, but I had no idea I'd find Philosophy even slightly interesting. Right now, I'm reading about the Hindu religion. I love the idea that I'm getting education!!  Psychology and Philosophy fit so well together, too. Usually I study one right after the other because of the overlap in some of the topics that the two classes discuss. While Philosophy ponders the idea of mind in a very abstract, ideal form, Psychology makes more of a direct pursuit to it's functions and how it works. It's amazing to see the two find out the same things or how a discovery in Psychology will back up a wispy thought in Philosophy. Now I'm getting really tired of writing those two class names. I read something interesting the other day that reminded me somewhat of this writing assignment. There was a young girl who was enchanted with this actor that people put her impassioned essay towards the man up on their web site and voted her fan oif the week. At first, her writing started out very structured, in fact, it seemed almost hesitant. However, about half way through her writing, some flood gate in her mind broke and the emotions just splashed messily on the page. She gave up on complete sentences and punctuation and ideas just flowed from her mind in a very sad, sad stream of obsession, desperation and tears. I clicked it away feeling very depressed. She was actually in love with the actor. However, I realized just how powerful this form of writing can be--it allowed me a peek in her mind, into her passions. Reading this, I'd say my passion was homework. That's almost just as distrubing.         
__label__label1 I am sitting at my desk at work. I should be doing other things. I'm angry for having to work today. This should be a day off. I could have taken it off but then I wouldn't get paid. No paid vacation for part time. I am tired even though I got a good amount of sleep last night. I really  shouldn't be tired. I don't feel like going to the gym this afternoon but I wil. I go the gym five days a week and I don't know why. I really don't see any real difference in my body. I started going really to improve myself but I have noticed no change in the several months I've been there. Never the less I still go everyday. I guess I'm just hoping it will pay off. I would really like a nap. Even if i skip the gym and go straight home I can't take a nap. I have homework to do. Not really required home work but reading and prepairing for classes this wek. I am realy trying to stay on top of all my classes this semester. If I slakck off I'll have serious problems in some of my courses. I'm not really sure if this is what I should be writing about. I'm just writing about what I'm thinking about as I sit here tyoing away. The more I think about it these are pretty normal thoughts for me. Most days I am tired and want to skip going to the gym. And most days I still go to the gym. Despite not seeing results I'm not what I would call discouraged. I never think of quiting going to the gym, I just wonder why I see no difference. And everyday I think about all the things I have to do at home that evening. What checks I need to write for bills. I need to write my rent check tonight. I also need to elt my roommates know that the electric and water bill is due soon. I need to change the elevtric and water bil out of my name because I am moving. Thats another thing I have to do when I get home tonight. I havve to start deciding waht I can fir into my new apartment and what I have to store or sell. These are all really basic thoughts for me. I'm always thinking ahead and planning what needs to be done at night or tomorrow or nex week etc. I am very organized, maybe too much if there is such a thing. I dion't really know anyone who is as organized as me. My mother doesn't call me organized she calls me controlling and anal retentive. I prefer organized and in control. I'm not always in control, but she doesn't know that. I don't tell her how out of control I feel in my relationship with my boyfriend. This is also another normal daily thought for me. Why I stay with someone who doesn't feel the same for me as I do for him. Or at least he is not sure. I often wonder if I'm stupid for staying, or is it just him who is tupid because he can't figure out what he wants or what he feels. Maybe its both. Thinkng about how much time I give to my boyfriend and how to limit that time is also a normal daily thought for me, at least lately. I am a planner, I like to know what the plans are for tonight or tomorrow night or the weekend. He doesn't make plans with anyone until that evening arrives. I've gotten to expect that from him but I can't say I've gotten use to it. I wish he would tell me his plans ahead of time but I know that he won't so I'm learining to adapt. I guess it is probaly good for someone like me to be with someone who makes her just relax. I know that everything doesn't have to be planned but for some reason I do try to plan everything I can. Controlling the caos I guess, or to try to control the best I can. I am really out of daily thoughts. I don't know what else to say. writing for twenty minutes straight is hard. My thought are just normal. I am listening to the radio and I don't know this song. Not that it matters I just leave the radio on at work for some background noise. Oh wait, I do know this song. I just didn't recognize it at first. I have a lot of reading to do tonight that I'm not looking forward to. Biology mostly. M developmental calss looks like it will be challenging but possibly very enjoyable. Who am I kidding, by the end of the semester very few classes are enjoyable they are just over and I am always glad just to pass. As orgainsed as I am  I sometimes feel overwhelmed at the beging of the semester trying to get everything organised and figure out what classes to give studying priority to. I usually study first the class I have next. I will fo home and read biology before I read psychology because I have biology tomorrow and psychology is not until wednesday.     
__label__label0      oops i don't know what i just did. But back to that, i always feel bad for the customers because who wants a server thats all sweaty? I would be so Thank god Alright im not really sure what to do now. I just typed for a complete 00 mins then the side of my hand hit return. Soooo i guess i'll type for ANOTHER 00 mins to make sure i get the credit. Im not an overachiever either, but i might as well just type. We're going to light some candles in our room now. My roommate just said our room smells like shoes. . mmmmmmmm. Luckily though we bought tons of candles for our room to light and smell fresh(er). Thank goodness we knew eachother before moving in so we could plot out our room and make it sooo pretty! Alright i feel a headache coming. I think because im hungry. I ate, what. maybe 0 or 0 0/0 hours ago?? aaaaah im hungry!!! Morning seems so far away. Alright my roommate just reminded me of how frustrating it is that i just typed all that beforehand and have to do it again. thanks!!!! yes i am frustrated. stupid hand!! its because i type fast and don't pay attention to what im hitting so much. I just get sooo into this, haha. hey her vanilla candle smells better than mine. oh well mine looks prettier. Ok  i need a date book. I just started thinking about the football games and when im going to go. I want one of our good friends from LOCNAME to come in hte weekend of the ORGNAME game. that would be fun for him. But problem. I think thats the day after Thanksgiving. The morning after actually. Shit. My friend PROPNAME will be in LOCNAME until Saturday, and I know im going to LOCNAME. . But i can always drive back in time thats no big deal at all. But what to do. Because Austin honesctly doesnt compare to CHicago. So i need something fun for him to do while hes here. I mean besides 0th street because he is a club freak. But its great, because hes so much fun to go out with!! And even better, he knows everybody either doormen or bartenders or owners or all of the above. So essentially he can get us in with no problem (not like theres much of a problem anyway being girls) because all the fun ones are 00 and over. Shhh don't tell my mom I told her i stopped going to them! She found out once because of jessicas crazy parents. oooh i can't stand that. But we still continued and had a jolly time. Everyone there knows us and that we're underage. Its great. really the chicago cops, the whole town is nuts. Everyone thinks texas is laid back, which it is, but really the chicago cops really just don't give a shit. There are so many undercover cops at the doors who know us, and even ones who work outside just patrolling the streets. But they look for more trouble than just underage drinkers. Kind of funny. One night about 0 cops were leaving this really big club downtown CHicago and stopped us on our way out and started asking questions. Like hold we were and blah blah. but they were all drunk and laughing, and traveling around in a paddy wagon!! We said we were 00, we're 00 i don't know why we said that. And they asked for our numbers and offered to take us out with them. But thats just how all of them are. Its sooo weird. But unless you know people its not so easy being underage, ORGNAME not a big underage drinkers fest. Which i really do think the law is ridiculous. If the drinking age were persay 00, then i don't think there would be such a huge   binge drinking   problem for kids when they leave to college. Because if kids are allowed to drink with parents supervision (which in IL its illegal) then the parents can monitor it and teach their kids. That way leaving for college isnt such a huge shock and kids won't get buck wild because they can drink without parents grounding them. Most of my friends parents were real laid back about that issue. All of our parents but one was kind of anal. But im glad i went out a lot in highschool and learned how the manage liquor because now i have no desire to try to get wasted and stupid like the rest of the freshman i see around here falling over themselves. Its really not that bad though. There are just a few dumb ones who arent used to it. I would honestly rather stay in my room during the week and keep up with my classes than drink a beer and get fat for no reason! Ok 0 more minutes of reading my typing. Im sorry for whoever does read this, hope youre not getting too bored. I really do enjoy psychology though, it interests me. I just wish i could have switched into an earlier class because i get out so late every day of the week but fridays!! I took a psychology course my senior year. It was really easy. We had a new teacher so she didnt know much what she was doing, but we still learned. I really wish i took the AP Psychology because they were honestly pretty much always at the same page as us and i heard it really wasnt that hard at all, which i thought the regular psychology was just too easy. At least i could have earned some credit from the AP test. WHoa listening to the fast typing sounds so weird. All of a sudden it just goes rapid fire and real fast! I feel like such a nerd. Im about to go crazy typing for the past 00 minutes straight. Ok someone keeps making noise out there whats going on. I have other work i could be doing right now!!! At least this doesnt have to be edited. That would be awful because i never do the right punctuation when it's not a formal paper. even letters to friends im so lazy. lazy americans. 00 more seconds!! this went by pretty quick though i guess. I still want to eat. I hope i can just fall asleep soon, what movie do i feel like watching? im stuck. ok im done now!!! 
__label__label1   College, in itself, is a completely new experience for me. Before I began I was mostly nervous about the academic aspect of it. I was afraid that I would not be able to handle the academic challenge of college here at the University. However, now that I am a week into classes, I feel more comfortable and more confident. My classes are challenging, but I feel like I can meet that challenge.      College is different for me in another way as well. I am from LOCNAME LOCNAME, so I am away for college. I am not far at all, but I am still away. I am very close to my family and friends so it is a little hard for me to be away from them. However, I am not feeling homesick at all. I do miss my family and friends back home, but I do not have that want or urge to go back home to go to school. I am becoming very comfortable in the environment that I am in. I am enjoying meeting new people and encountering new experiences.       Before I left to come to LOCNAME, I met this guy and we became a little more than just good aquaintances. I liked this guy a lot because he listened to me and understood me. We had gone through very similar situations concerning our past with family, so it's more like we understood each other. It was because we understood each other so well that I became convinced that this guy was my soul mate. I loved him for the person he was. However, I was confused and thought that this meant that I was in love with him. It wasn't until just recently that I discovered that i wasn't in love with him. All this time I feel like I was leading him on to believe that I loved him, and I thought that I did. He did absolutely everything for me. He sent me flowers, came up here to visit me for just a few hours, bought phone cards for us to talk on the phone for hours, and so much more. How is it that I could not be in love with this person? When I told him how I felt just a few days ago, he felt so betrayed. He thought that I had been lying to him this whole time about my feelings. Was I? I, myself, didn't even know exactly how I felt. And the worst part is that I couldn't even explain myself clearly to him, which made him so confused. He thought that it was something he did wrong that made me not love him. I don't want to hurt him because I do care about him a lot and, like I said before, I do love the person he is. I just can't give him the same affection he gives me. I can't make myself love him like he loves me. I feel so selfish for doing this, and I don't know what to do about it. I wish there was something I could tell him that would make him understand. But even if he understood, that wouldn't stop him from feeling hurt and rejected.   
__label__label1 So I have twenty minutes to write about what I think. I was thinking of all the things I thought I would write earlier, but suddenly I'm drawing a blank. I think I'm going to stop trying to write properly because there's really no point. after all, I'm supposed to write what I'm thinking, and if I get to caught up in punctuation I don't think my thoughts will flow as naturally as they would if I was not' typing at all. nick lachey is pretty swoll, and a pretty good singer. jessica simpson can look hot, but at times she looks rather plain. there are a lot of plain looking girls here, somewhat of a disappointment. isn't college suppose to have a lot of hot girls?  o well, I have a girlfriend, so it really shouldn't matter. I remember hearing that the average male thinks about sex every 0 seconds or something like that, and it looks like I'm get to that subject pretty soon. I like timberland. he consistently makes good beats. but magoo fell off on the last single I heard from them. what's the name of that single?  I think its one and all. I turned off the music because I don't think as randomly as usually do when its on. Its like I focus on the music and that is all exists. maybe that is y I could be a good dj if I tried, but I never practice, and that's why omar's upset wit me. I hope he is doing alright now. he says he is, but I know he is still tripping, at least every now and then. man, I told him not to trip on emmi, but what he don't know is that I trip on her too. that is pretty fucked up, but I can't help it. as erin said, that girl's seductive. and she really is seductive. I wonder why. she is not THAT hot, and I see a lot of flaws when I look at her, but I still want to get with that. maybe its just lust. now that I think of it, it is mostly lust. but I would never mistreat her. well, I don't think I would mistreat her. I thought I would never cheat on my girlfriend, but look what I did in cancun. I can really trust my boys--everytime I got a dirty secret, they shut they mouth. its' not cool that I have such a big mouth. I been saying I need to work on it, and I think I'm finally getting there. now that I'm controlling this part of my personality, maybe I can control my hormones as well. but I'm 00, and everyone says they know what I mean when I tell them wussup. felix agreed with me, even hazel. life savers kickers are pretty damn good. I'm tripping, thinking bout emmi again. I don't know why I'm so infatuated wit her. but its not that strong of an infatuation. not like it was wit crystal. when I saw her at the omega talent show, I still thought she was fly. and I say she is a stuck up bitch, but I know if she honestly wanted to date I wouldn't think twice. I wish I was like those cats that know how to pull any girl. I'm starting to realize its a game, and pulling a girl is as simple as making her think you have what she wants and needs in life. I need to stop thinking bout other girls. I have a gf. just like I need to stop chatting on AIM because all it does is keep my from doing my work. I'm getting sleepy. the fire alarm went off again. I wonder if anyone actually watches the monitors that are hooked up to the cameras in the halls. well, I guess they do seeing what happened to dennis the other day. I'm getting sleepy. I wonder if I meet jaymee ong if I'd actually have the nerves to approach her. probably not, unless I was famous like her. and even then, I don't know if I would. probably if I was drunk I'd do it. hahah. I wonder if I'll have the nerves to go up to carol from alpha sigma rho. there I got thinking bout other girls again. and here I go getting sleepy. every time I take my eyes off the monitor I get sleepy        my fingers are starting to get a bit tired. this is the first assignment I've had that requires me to think about what to think about. man, chatting online never makes me sleepy, but its the exact same thing I'm doing now. sa was right. it is all in my head. if I could control every aspect of my behavior, that would work to my advantage. no more fallen asleep wen I have to read for class, or falling asleep on the road. maybe it just requires discipline not to procrastinate. but it would be cool to control the mind and have telekinesis and ORGNAME. I think semi just sent me a text message, but I only got a minute left, so I'll wait till I'm done with this before I see what she said. I want to sing. if I could sing, I would rule the world hahaha. maybe not, but I'd feel like king. right now, that is wut I want most in life 
__label__label0 well I think this is a fun experiment. lets see, what am I feeling? I'm sick. and I can't stop sneezing and coughing. which is distracting as I try to write this. I'm not sure but as I'm writing this I go back and correct my spelling mistakes. I love rings I need to get some more. I only have one on my middle finger and its really pretty. man I can't believe I didn't say hi to brian this morning when I saw him. its so pointless to act like I didn't see him when I looked right his way this morning. god I hope doesn't think I'm some kind of moody bitch. I feel incompetent. I have no specialty. last night I tried writing 0 songs but it doesn't help that I don't know anything about songwriting or reading music or coming up with a beat. although I must say I have things to say. so at least that is good. I'm annoyed with myself for getting hung up on things that already happened. wait am I doing this wrong. this feels  more like a journal entry than just what am thinking in the moment. ok I need to stop reading what I just wrote. this room is dark I should open the blinds and jeez if my nose could just stop running. man I'm tired of typing already and its only been about 0 minutes. I need to call maz and ask what is up with our friend who I emailed 0 days ago and has not responded yet. I wonder if he is still in egypt and maybe doesn't have access to a computer. I want to paint my bedroom a light green or yellow color. does that say anything about me. god I feel nauseous. I don't even know how to spell that word. I have to stop eating weird combinations of food. I just had peach yogurt, garlic and parmesan cheese its and graham crackers with milk. I don't even have room for lunch. I must work out. god beyonce has a nice stomach in that baby boy" music video. if I could lose another 00 pounds that would be awesome. I just need to work out. I need determination. that is such a powerful emotion. I need to buy more shoes and clean up this mess in my room. but it seems I clean it every other day. ok now I'm freaking out. I have 0 tests this week and I feel a little lost is most of them. boy I need some will power to . man I can't get over this nasty feeling of what I just ate. I feel so lost. what do I do. maybe a nice shower might help. oh only 00 seconds left. this went by faster than I thought it would go. and times up . I'm done! 
__label__label1 So I'm laughing right now because I think this is really weird. Makes me feel kind of uncomfortable I guess, I don't know why though. But my stomach kind of hurts right now, my roommate and I just had some ice cream, so maybe that's why. I'm kind of stressed right now, and I hope I get everything I need to get done done tonight. I'm really tired and I just want to go to bed. I'm really hot in my dorm, maybe I should turn the fan on, but I'm too lazy to get up and do that right now. So I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing right now. I talked to him a few minutes ago and he was doing homework. I wonder what homework he has?  Man, I'm really not looking forward to tomorrow. I have so much stuff to do, at least that's what I feel like. And I really want to go to TOPS to look at the pictures. Hopefully PROPNAME will go with me tomorrow and do that. My foot is really itching me, I think I got bit by a bug tonight at the ZETA house. I was outside doing my homework which was probably not a good idea, but oh well. Oh I need to call my parents too. I wonder if they're having a good time in LOCNAME. I wish I was there right now. I miss them already, but I'm only three hours away so it's okay. I'll be fine. I really want to go running outside on the track tonight. It felt so good out earlier and I bet that would help with my feeling stressed out. But I probably won't because I'm so tired and my stomach still hurts. I wonder what's wrong with it. Twenty minutes is a long time, I've only been writing for seven minutes now, wow. I hope I have fun this weekend. I'm excited about the UT football game. The last game was so much fun even though it was raining. I guess that made it more interesting. I'm looking at my pictures by my desk now and I really miss my friends from my hometown. I really miss PROPNAME, I hope she is doing fine at ORGNAME ORGNAME. And PROPNAME, I hope he is still not mad at me. Maybe I should call him tomorrow, I think I will. And I can't believe PROPNAME got her nose pierced up in LOCNAME. She is a wild one, but I guess that makes her who she is. I wish I was in LOCNAME. I love the mountains and the nice weather there. I bet she is having a great time at school. I'm spacing out right now. I never thought I could have writer's block when I'm writing about what's going through my head. That's really weird. And I'm saying really" a lot. I guess I like that word or something, who knows. I need to go to the bathroom, but I only have about seven more minutes, so I'm just going to wait it out. Is going to even a word?  I'm not sure. I'm thinking about tomorrow again and hoping that my TA for Calculus teaches well tomorrow. I can't really understand him and I really need help in that class, so hopefully he will have some good things to say. Our sink in the room keeps on dripping and it's really bothering me. I wish it would stop. PROPNAME just got a phone call, I wonder who it is?  She is a cool girl, I'm glad I'm rooming with her. If I had to room with a complete weirdo I would freak out. That would be horrible. I think she is talking to her somewhat "boyfriend. "  They're dating I guess, and I set them up!  I did a good job. I guess he is coming up to our room right now. PROPNAME's excited!  I wish my boyfriend was coming to see me. He lives in LOCNAME so I understand. I hope PROPNAME doesn't think I'm a complete slob when he comes up here since I'm in my pajamas and have no make up on. Oh well, I don't need to impress him anyways. It just got really quiet in our room. It's an awkward silence because PROPNAME just turned her fan off. She must be cold, but why and I so hot. I just popped my back and it felt so good. It's been pretty sore lately, but I'm not sure why. I just remembered that I have to read after this. That really sucks. It's going to be a long night I guess, but I can handle it. Oh PROPNAME is here now, that's cool. 
__label__label0 ok, ummm, I'm hungry. just got out of psych class and I was hoping to go home, but must turn this writing assignment in before friday. the lie detector presentation was interesting. sadly I started nodding off around the part where dr. PROPNAME was talking about dopamine and schizophrenia and parkinsons. I was never completely asleep, just in and out of consciousness. man, my typing skills are really sucky. anyway, ricky's in my head. he is turning 00 on september 00. I always think he and chelsea should be together because chelsea wants it that way. wanted. she says she is over him, but I don't know. I am excited about the garlic toast I'm going to make with andrea's tuna casserole. yes, my roommate is also andrea. she is the more prominent andrea. totally super smart, super pretty, super nice. I could totally jealous. no, envious because she has what I don't have, she is not taking what I used to have. yeah, I could totally envy her, but it's just not so. she is a blessing. so. I need to make a bracelet for jodi. hopefully she is doing ok. and why is kirk still in my head? we weren't even super friends, just very casual acquaintances, but he manages to pop back in my head after three years. great job kirk. actually, I think I like thinking about him. or the idea that I have of him. I don't really know him so I can only entertain the ideas that I have of the hypothetical kirk. and I feel old. and worn out. and everytime I'm close to the edge of the sidewalk and a big bus passes by, I somewhat regret that I didn't fall or stumble into its path. I'm not suicidal, but the drama that comes with saying or writing these things is fun. I could die so easily. if death came right now, I'd go with him. even more so if he was cute. but I have too many people to be responsible to. not just friends and family but everyone who I've told that life is good. where am I going with this? I don't know. but it's more interesting than an itchy foot, no? so biology is making me feel anxious. hard professor, dr. edmiston, but I like it that way because it's like a battle or a contest. you get through, if I get that A, then it's going to be so cool because it's such a hard-ass class. andrea's hardass class is physics, but hers is plan II so it's probably triple the intensity of my biology  class. I'm glad I have something to work for, something to worry about because it was too easy at uta (arligton). I was not' challenged so I slacked off. worked more and got more money, yeah, but wasted time and  money on classes that I liked but weren't going towards nursing. oh well. I tell andrea I feel like a gray crayon here in austin. but I don't feel that all the time, just when I realize how gray I am compared to others. I'm thinking of what to type so this is probably only partial stream-of-consciousness, and not because I have something to hide but I'm better at writing. my thinking and writing speeds are almost the same. or, that's not good, I can slow my thinking to my writing speed but not to my typing speed. and I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. an eternal darkness, but I wouldn't know because I'd be asleep. but then if I ever wake up on the other side I'd feel guilty leaving people behind. so that was twenty minutes? yeah, if you want to see more stream-of-consciousness just ask to see my blue notebook. I usually sit front and center and no more than three rows back. but who would care? but it's there. ok, bye! 
__label__label0 Right now I am thinking about the point of this I guess maybe it does have some point but I really don't see one but anyhow its not that bad of an assignment I mean just typing what you are thinking for twenty minutes. my dorm room is rather hot and I want to get up to turn our fan on but I won't because then I would have to leave the computer and then I couldn't track my thoughts for those few second that I leave the computer. I waiting for a phone call from my boyfriend he was supposed to call around 0:00 but he has not called yet and its starting to irritate me I also notice that I have only been typing for like 0 minutes. I wonder what I'm going to be typing for 00 more minutes. gosh I have some much to do tonight I have to starch my army uniform and polish my boots and I have to finish retyping my rhetorical analysis paper that didn't get saved for some reason and then I have to do some biology reading and finsih some biology questions. I don't really like my biology class but I do like my chemistry class but that probably just because its easy and I've done well in it so far. my ear is starting to hurt . I hope I don't have an ear infection. I feel like I'm starting to get a headache maybe its because I'm tired or maybe because I'm hungry . or maybe because I'm dehydrated. I dunno but once this is over I think I'm going to take some advil and hopefully that will make it feel better this is hard forcing myself to write what I'm thinking of . I've been looking at a computer screen most of the day and my eyes are starting to hurt maybe that is why I have a headache . who knows . but I can't wait till I get to  go to sleep . so do you guys actually read these I bet these can get really interesting I mean if I had to read over 000 of these I'd probably be pretty bored. but maybe pysch guys just like reading random thoughts, hundreds of them . is it stimulating?  I'm dating a guy who a psych. major . he is in grad school right now . mastering in something pysch related . he is supposed to call me right now . maybe he got held up reading random stream of conscious stuff . my jaw is aching right now too . I have tmj and it sucks my jaw is out of alignment and it hurts really bad. I wish I could just pop it back in place but that would be all sorts of hard and probably fairly painful . but anyways and its only been like 00 minutes . this is crazy . after this I have to do some real writing that does not rock my world because I know that I'll be tired and I won't feel like doing it an then I'll tell myself that I'll sleep for like an hour and then wake up and finish what I need to do but it won't happen . gosh I'm so freaking tired and my ears are really starting to hurt but I think it might be from my jaw and that probably why I have a headache . gosh I really could go for a massage right about now but I don't want to spend any of my money . my boyfriend gives really good massages and he is supposed to call me but he has not called me yet . what a dick. ugh how much longer of this seriously twenty minutes . I doubt that this writing assignment, aside from a simple grade, really benefits me in anyway . so is this an assignment so you psych guys can have experiments and such? crazy so we pay money to take a class so we can do assignments for psych guys who use them as experiments . hmmm I don't know if I like that idea . but oh well because this assignment is a lot better than the next one that I will have to do . but this is making me so tired and my eyes are really starting to have a hard time focusing on the computer and then when I close them I want to keep them shut and just sleep for like a few seconds and then a few seconds more oh well I only have like a minute left count down . 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ah nice its over  
__label__label0 So I'm sitting here writing this thingy for psyche. I feel like a dork for getting this project done so early but I wanted to get it over with. It think it's funny that you, Prof. PROPNAME, may read these and still have absolutely no idea who we are. It must be rough being a prof. in a big class like my PSY000. My mom is always reminding me that I didn't take it in high school and that's what I get for not taking it in high school. a giant class. It shouldn't be a horrible class though. I can't believe someone would paste something in this rather than just writing. I love writing. I've been writing a summer journal for the past 00 years and I love it. I'd love to write for a living but I just do the journal thing well. I could write a journal-type book, or a sex in the city type article. bah, there's no money in anything I want to do. listening to frank sonatra. he is very relaxing. come fly with me come fly let's fly away. ol blue eyes. man, this is going to be harder than I thought. it's only been 0 minutes and 00, 0 minutes, 0 minutes and 0 sec. ok I can't do that forever. what would happen if someone IMed me right now?  would I fail the assignment because I stopped writing?  I should have turned it off. yuck. I just burped. ew, I just wrote that I just burped. see, I had spaghetti for lunch and I can still taste it because the food sucks. I miss home all ready. I feel like a dork because I miss home, and I want to go home every weekend. I need to be social. I need to get out and met more people. there's so much pressure on college to be great because high school blew for me. my head itches. bleh. bleh, what to say what to say. my arm hurts now and it's only been 0 minutes and 00 sec, 00, 00. ok I'll stop for real now. I am a dork for doing my writing assignment so early, aren't I?  I guess no one will know. why do I even care?  I keep switching in and out of I and I. capitals that is. I never do capitals when I'm typing on AIM so why should I do it now. I don't think it capital letters. !  well well well. this better go through. the testing. pre testing that is, doesn't work yet. I hope this works because I don't have a printer that will verify that I actually did the assignment. yea for being a poor college student. actually, I live in san jac and I had no idea that everyone thought this is where the snobs live, geez. genevieve just got on. I wouldn't talk to her even if I wasn't doing this thing. ah, sharp pains in my arm. that's so weird!  I guess it's the constant typing. this is pretty fun actually. except for the pain in my arm. I've got you under my skin. wooo ol blue eyes. geez I'm a  dork. maybe you'll read this out loud to your classes, how mortified I'd be. I just try to blend in everywhere. I know you wouldn't be so mean to say my name, more or less ask me to stand up or something in class. wow, I would die of embarrassment. I'm embarrassed very easily. it had to be you. ah, I miss rex. rex is my boyfriend in michigan. he is really bothering me lately, and it's not fair for me to say he is bothering me. he called me last night to tell me he couldn't talk because his friends from GR came down to hang out with him, and I got all mad that he couldn't talk to me. man that was annoying. I'm not allowed to be mad that he has a social life and I don't. I guess I'm jealous?  I don't think so. I don't know. I wish he would just not nap right NOW when I could be talking to him. I can be mad about that right?  he COULD talk to me now but he decided to sleep. man my arm hurts. bleh        I'm kinda thirsty, can I stop to get a drink. I guess I can wait 00 minutes. HEY this is my favorite frank sinatra song. Luck be a lady. man I want to do a dance to this. I want to learn how to swing dance before my wedding. there are a lot of things I want to do at my wedding, but I wanted to say before my wedding. bleh. weddings. my mom keeps telling me I'll be cut off when I get married. financially that is. she just doesn't want me to marry rex because she thinks he won't be able to provide for me, which is probably true. he really doesn't know what he wants to do. I wish money mattered a little to him. not a LOT but a little. I like this song a lot. a lady doesn't leave her escort, it isn't fair, and it's not nice. this isn't really what you wanted is it?  oh geez, well, why does it matter?  you probably won't even read it. why would you read MY paper out of the 0000 people that you have in your classes?  0 more minutes. I'm tired, my eyes feel so heavy. but I got enough sleep. maybe I got too much sleep. I hate that ann let al sleep on my bed, al smells really disgusting. I don't know how she can date someone that smells so disgusting. my arm hurts. bleh!  my eys feel really heavy. sheish. 0 more minutes. my shoulders feel tired too. I want to go out tonight. I don't want to see major again and I don't really want to hang out with da, but I feel like I need to go out and do stuff. I'm really sick of eating  by myself. really sick of it. it's the worst feeling to watch the evening sitcoms in jester city limits by yourself. how come everyone else has friends to eat with and not me?        lcuk be a lady toooniiiiggggghhhhttt. wow, I'm a giant dork. WOW. how mortified I would be if you knew who I was or if you even read it, or if you *gasp* read it out loud in my class. I'd probably cry and run out. I've been crying a lot lately because of rex. a lot. I really like crying sometimes because it just lets me let it out. I had to go all the way to the edge of campus last night because ann was here with al and was doing. well, whatever they were doing. and I had to go by the river to cry about rex. well, one more minute. I hope you never read this, and I hope I get credit for it. all I ask is that you don't let anyone see it if you really do read it. that would be mortifying. and even if it is a good example for the assignment. I would be so mortified. you have no idea. ok 00, 00, self destruct,     ?        
__label__label1 PROPNAME'm at my grandmother's house and it's pouring rain. I was supposed to go to this meeting for the ORGNAME ORGNAME but since it's raining I'm not going to go. Even though the social events aren't required its going to bug me all night wondering if the current sweethearts are going to hold it against me. Even though I know other people probably won't go I still feel like I will stick out as not going and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. I really don't know. I couldn't be any more tired. I waited in line for 0 in a half hours to get a ticket to the Texas-Ou gPROPNAMEe. It was so chaotic. It's amazing to see how much people will pay for those tickets. Some people were going as high as $000 for one ticket that they sell for $00. Luckily I got one and I'm so happy. I had to go to work after that and it felt like I had just gone swimming because I was drenched in sweat. I looked so bad and I went in 0 hours late. I thought I was going to get fired. I'm going to stay at my grandma's house since it's  raining, I wonder what I'm going to wear?  Why do I care so much?  People go to school looking ten times worse than me and no one cares, but I can't get myself to go to school without makeup. I wish I wasn't so self-conscious. It's weird, you always think you look fine until it comes someone else's turn to judge you than you get nervous about what they think. Who cares?  That's how I wish I could feel. Even though I wear sweat shorts and t-shirts to school I still care if they match or I wonder if I wore it last week. Why can't I stop caring about what people might think about me?  I bet no one even pays attention to me. I really don't know if I'm vain for thinking that people look at me or insecure because I care if they do. I can't believe my boyfriend hasn't called me yet. I met this girl yesterday at the sweetheart meeting and she seemed so cool. We talked and got along and she drove me to my car and we were going to go to the social together. When I called her though she didn't seem the same she was just like Oh, it's you or I don't know. Maybe I expect to much out of people. It just seemed to me that she was being fake yesterday by the way she was acting towards me today. I can't wait until time is up, but it actually hasn't seemed that long. I didn't really think this would be this easy. I guess you can tell things to a computer and it won't tell you to shutup after you complain to much. I WONDER IF I SHOULD READ FOR MY Class tomorrow?  I feel so exhausted like I haven't slept in days and today wore me out. I feel like I could sleep for three days. Hopefully pretty soon I'll catch on to this whole college thing. I have exactly 00 seconds and I really don't know what to write so I'm just going to say that I am PROPNAME happy that I got a TExas-Ou ticket again because it the best thing that has happened in a while. 
__label__label1 Gosh, I'm so tired right now. Crazy. and oh so overwhelmed with school. I mean how much reading could I possibly get this semester. I hate having vision problems. it just feels like everything is this world is working against me. I mean the blind people get all of their books on tape before me. well reality check. I CAN'T READ MY BOOKS EITHER. I guess I could make a big stink about it. because by law they have to arrange for me to get assistance for my disability. but its too much hassle and I already feel really uncomfortable about my disability. I mean. I just hope that if I transfer schools that they will give me more individualized assistance. something ORGNAME has no idea how to do. Why do I hate my roommate so much. I think I need therapy for how much I hate her. I actually get a pang in my stomach when I know she is at the apartment. that is a major problem. adn when I go into my apartment I close my bedroom door in order to say don't even try to talk to me". and the really really sad thing is that I don't think she has a clue how much I hate her. I haven't had this much rage towards someone since 00th grade. and those are the only two people in my whole entire life that I have ever hated. PROPNAME and my spanish teacher . Its weird some people just rub me the wrong way and there is  no forgiving them. I get along with everyone. I mean everyone. so for me to have an enemy it is actually quite odd. I wonder why dan and vab always have to act like they are cool and don't care about stuff. It actually really bothers me. I mean, for God's sake, show some freaking emotion. Its so ridiculous. ummm have I mentioned how tired I am?  my eyes are closing on me. I really need to get more sleep in the future. I wonder if I really should transfer schools. I mean. that would mean moving back into my parents house. that would mean I can't come home drunk. I can't bring guys back to just hang out. gosh. all the fun stuff I do here would have to end. but then you just weigh that against my future. I mean I think if I got more assistance for my disability, I would go farther in life. which obviously is my ultimate goal. No one even knows I can't see well. I hide it so well,. I've known people for 0 years and they still don't know. I mean. they'll make fun of my vision but they never put 0 and 0 together. I wonder if I would if I was in there position?          oh my gosh. I'm soooooooo tired. now my eyes are burning. is this a sick joke?  I still have like 0 minutes to go. I don't know if I'm going to make it. my money situation is horrible. I seriously spend too much money on alcohol. I mean I spend so much freaking time studying during the week, that I feel like I  DESERVE to go out on the weekends. ya know. so I just spend my money on that. so why isn't it raining outside?  It was raining so magnificently last night. I love it when it pours rain. I reminds me of my dad. We always would go outside on our patio when it would thunder and lightning and just watch it. It was always so amusing to me and my sister and I would always have father-daughter bonding time. I miss my dad. why does he have to live in LOCNAME anyways. What a joke. my family does not deserve that one bit. Thank God he has a good and secure job though. otherwise I would be at a community college instead of LOCNAME right now. only 0 minutes to go. ummm. yep. once again I am tired. I got invited to a party tonight. I kinda don't want to invite dan. cause he always acts like he is too cool. when in all reality I'm too cool for him. so he feels like he has to act that way in order to compensate. Why is Suneal GAY. He is such the perfect guy for me. that royally sucks. Aren't there any straight wonderful gentlemen still left in this world of ours. I sure haven't found them. /. oh my!  0 minute. yippee        honestly that was a very excruciatingly long 00 minutes. I think you could have gotten the stream of consciousness point across by making it 00 minutes. but whatever        times up. oh darn!        peace out         
__label__label1 This is a strange colored screen. I'm glad the page has a timer at the top, I really didn't want to keep track of time myself. I have so much work to do today, I'm just glad that I have lots of time to do it. I should probably make sure that I don't misspell words and all of that, it's not like I will have time to check it over when I'm done. I almost feel bad for whoever has to read this, I mean there's probably going to be a large amount of frighteningly boring writings (including mine). Trying to write this with the TV on probably isn't a great idea either, so off it goes. This weekend should be a good time, but I'm still not looking forward to it. I still need to get a birthday present for a friend of mine as well. I should look online to see if she has anything going on the day of the Mars Volta show and get her tickets, that would be very cool. Knowing my luck she probably won't be able to go, but I should still try. Her parent like me enough to let her stay with me, but I don't know when she would go back home. Hopefully she won't have a game that friday, or else none of this will work. I still need to help PROPNAME with her homework, and somehow find time to go to practice tonight. This band really isn't as much fun as I thought it would be. In fact, the music is really boring me. I should talk to them about possibly adding or taking away parts to make it better. These guys listen to way too much indie rock, which means I probably won't have a good chance of making the music any harder. This is going to be a very long writing, so I apologize for whoever has to read this. I hope studying for Latin doesn't take too much time tonight, because I need to get to bed early. It's amazing that I can wake up at 00:00 to be in class by noon, yet I am still tired even if I got like 00 hours of sleep. I don't know how people go to class at 0. I tried an 0:00 class this summer and I ended up not going to it more times than I went. I always figured that going to class would be the easy part; I was wrong. I can still manage to fall asleep in any class so long as its during some sort of lecture. Maybe one of these days I should go to bed at like 0pm and just see when I wake up naturally. Chances are I still won't get out of bed before noon. The night is such a better time to do things. Its not incredibly hot, there's not as many people out, and there are a lot more interesting things to do at night (say on 0th street) than there is during the day. Granted you can't exactly go clothes shopping at 0 in the morning, but you don't get to see bands play during lunchtime either. I can't wait for next weekend. Going down to LOCNAME LOCNAME to see my friends play is going to be a great time. Hopefully I can get some more friends to go with who might like their music. If not, oh well. They are playing with another band that I really enjoy as well, which should make for a very enjoyable time. I should spend more time in LOCNAME LOCNAME, there is a lot of stuff to do there. 0 flags is nice if you have the money, I just don't have the money as of late. I should really try to find a part time job up here so that I can have some resemblance of cash flow. Maybe get a decent job and save up enough money to go somewhere this summer. I would really love to go on a cruise or something like that. Unfortunately, I will probably end up spending the money on bass gear and food. I need food to live though, and bass gear is always good. I still need to do the pretesting after this as well. I don't have a printer either, that could be a pain. Hopefully I can just save the page for printing and simply print it out after I go buy a printer. The time is almost up and it really didn't feel like it took long at all. Maybe that is because I'm used to writing like 0 page papers, I like the simplicity of this. I wonder how many grammar rules I broke during the course of this writing. Oh well. 
__label__label1 today all I think about is snow skiing, I cannot wait to be in the mountains, its so liberating and right now I feel so tied down and constricted, my room is annoying me at the moment because I do not like my desk space, it is uncomfortable so I find it hard to work in, which makes me not want to do anything at my desk. right now I feel so lost in life, there are so many things that I want to do and I know I have all the time in the world, but I feel like everything is moving so fast, especially now that my best friend is back at school, I feel we just started summer together yesterday and now he and I both are gone and back our separate ways, which is for the best, but at times it is so hard because I feel like a whole sector of my life is missing and I spend most of my days thinking about it and how it really is not that long until we see each other again and I look forward to the coming years but I get scared because I wonder if my future involves him. we have many of the same passions and we desire to do the same things, but I wonder if we will do them together or own way. I constantly think about my future but not really the success aspect, but rather the things that I want to do the things that make me happy, which for awhile would not include a job. I guess I don't really think about growing up that much but really like I said earlier that all I think about is going skiing this winter, I feel like the mountains are my home, like that is where I belong and I am itching to get back, because I have not been in so long. when people ask where my favorite place to be is, it is definitely the mountains. its like this little place god created where I can get away and forget about everything that drags me down, and just allow me to stand in awe and take in all that this earth has to offer, its like it releases me. not only that I love skiing it is my favorite form of exercise, and its just all I can think about considering how hot it is here and I cannot wait to get away the heat and get where the air knocks you off you feet. 
__label__label0 Ok well I have been putting this off for a while, but now I'm sitting down to do it. Just to let you know I'm really bad with punctuation and spelling and capitalization when I'm typing on the computer. its good in word because it corrects your spelling and capitals and grammar for you, friends is on the tv in the background right now, that show has been on for a long time. I'm really kinda stressed right now, I feel like I'm really behind in my classes and reading and homework. it would be good to have like a full free day or two. I guess that is what the weekend is, but this weekend I'm going home, my parents are really excited that I'm going. I have to get my acr fixed because I ran into a tire on the road the other day and it screwed up the bumper. I never understood that, who is the guy driving around with no tire? I really really don't understand that. things are a little weird right now, my roomie's going through some rough times and I'm trying to be there for her, I really hope I can be all shse needs. and than my boyfriend is like 000 miles away up in arkansas and I miss him like crazy. I wish he was here sometimes, but it seems like we'll really enjoy the time we have together now that its limited. he is a great guy and I miss him so much. anyways I'm not really sure what to write about now, my classes are ok, but I feel bogged down with work right now, I don't want to feel like I'm complaining about it. I also am a really bad typer. I never took that class in grade school where they teach you the home row and stuff and so I have to look at my fingers a lot. , really, I shouldn't blame it on not having the class, I could have learned on my own, but I didn't, oh well, I'm making it. but I'm not correcting my spelling and typos very much right now, but I notice that as I type my typing is getting better and faster and I have to look less and less at the keys because I'm getting more and more used to it as I sit here. college seems weird to me. so many people, so many changes. my roommate and one of my suitemates are both friends from high school which is awesome, they're great but its been hard for all of us to get out and meet people because ww hang out together a lot so that we don't have to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations and deal with new people. but I talked to some really nice kids today. things are good, I don't know if I should go home or not this weekend but my parents really want to see me and its just a drive to houston which is not very bad so I'm going to go, I'm looking forward to seeing my brother too, he is a freshman this year. soooooooooooooo anyways I don't know what to talk about. seinfeld is on tv now, I really like that show, funny, lighthearted, and you never have to know anything from the previous episode to catch the new one, I really like that because then I don't have to be committed to watching every night. all my books are on my bed right now and this writing assignment is not due for two days but I'm doing it now, even though I have assignments due in the morning, I think I'm just putting those off and instead I'm doing this because it seems a little more enjoyable than doing calculus problems or something like that, or reading, ugh I hate the reading. I'm not a good reader I don't think, I'm horrible at reading comprehension, at least that is what the standardized tests say. but anyways I'm a slow reader, I think, ok only 00 pages. but then 00 pages take me like an hour and 00 minutes. no small ordeal. wow I can't believe I have written this much I'm only 00 minutes, I have no idea what I'm going to write about for 0 more minutes. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I wonder what happens if you push the finish button before the time is up, I don't want to try but I bet someone does. someone who just wants to get out of whatever they can. maybe someone will tell me sometime. yay one of my suitemates just came home, she is on the phone, she is really cool. she just asked what I was doing, I tried to tell her and write at the same time, I didn't do very well, my fingers didn't press the right keys, hard to do two things at once, I'm not one of those people who can like talk on the phone and clean or mess with the computer at the same time, I need to focus on talking on the phone or something else. not both, that is probably because I don't want to let the other people think that I'm not paying attention to them, ah I just got distracted for like 00 seconds. yipe. so anyways, well my timing is going down I only have two more minutes left and now I feel like I need a break but I don't have time for breaks, I think I'll make some coffee and stay up late and get stuff done. yay only one more minute. my room is messy right now too. I don't really mind it if its my mess though, oh well, ill clean it up soon, I am soooooo excited that this is almost over! it was a lot harder just to write than I thought. wow 
__label__label0 I am sitting in front of my computer in a small Jester dormitory. I look around and I notice that the room is a complete mess. I take a deep breath and I can smell something funny. That's right, that's how Jester rooms always smell like. I am feeling pretty full right now after a eating a delicious sandwich from the Jester City Limits. The room is nice and cold, unlike the hot and humid weather outside. My roommate is out of the room right now, so it's a little quieter than usually. I am playing some music on my computer right now. Besides the music coming out of the speakers of my computer, I can hear occasional chatter and doors opening and closing in the hallways. My roommate walks in after eating at Jester City Limits. I say hi to him and how his dinner was. He notices something weird as I read out what I am typing. He asks, What the crap are you doing?"  I respond by telling him that this is for my psychology class. I turn my attention away and try to think of what to write next. I am sitting upright in an uncomfortable wooden chair that came furnished with the room. I uncross my legs because my left leg is starting to feel numb. I hear someone using the blow-dryer in the bathroom, which is right outside of my room. I look up at my bookshelf and see all my textbooks. That reminds me that I have lots of other homework to do when I finish with this assignment. I have a strange anxious feeling because I am a little behind in all my classes, especially with reading the textbooks. I think about how I have missed three morning classes already, a quiz in one of those classes, and I get an awful, guilt-like feeling because I don't want to do badly in my classes. Maybe I should go to sleep earlier tonight, for that matter, every night. I notice my computer's processor making slight noises as I am typing. I take off my glasses because I only need them to read. I look back up at the bookshelf and remind myself how much work I still have left to do. I notice that I have been shaking my right leg. Maybe I have been doing this the whole time?  Some sort of a nervous habit I guess. I feel a little pain on the surface of my knee. I reach down and touch the band-aid covering a wound that I suffered from playing soccer at LOCNAME last night. And the twenty minutes is up. A pop up says that I can keep on writing with my stream of consciousness. Does that mean that I should just finish with my train of thought, or should I keep writing more and more?  Maybe that would help me get a better grade on this assignment. Ok, I am going to just stop and press the "Finish" button. 
__label__label0 I have no clue how to start this. I haven't bought my psychology book yet. Is that bad? I wish I could do that DJ thing at the beginning of class. The guy last time played horrible music. I made a friend in that class named PROPNAME. She seems cool. I hope we get to hang out. This feels like a diary entry. Is that what it's supposed to be like?  Today PROPNAME and I went down to a free barbecue thing and met some new people. One girl we met reminded my of my ex-boyfriends new girlfriend. It really got on my nerves. Not because I'm jealous, just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation. PROPNAME is really annoying me. I'd like to just stop talking to him altogether. But hang out with him at the same time. And PROPNAME. I don't know what to do with PROPNAME. I don't know if I love him or not. I don't know if I'll ever really be in love. He says the sweetest things to me, so it's easy for  me to say sweet things back to him. But I don't know if I really feel it or not. I think I'm really heartless. And I haven't been in English for a long time! I'm forgetting whether to capitalize the I" in some words. Odd. My arm hurts. Am I going to have to keep this up for 00 minutes? I wonder if some people write really poetic things in their stream of consciousness writings. Mine is all boring teenage bullshit. Let's try and write something deep. It's quiet in the dorm hall, save the occasional dorm slam. All the girls are in their rooms, wasting tears on heartless boys and wasting brain cells on pointless worksheets. The faint shimmer of hope of the future they saw on the first day of college has almost completely faded, all in a couple of days. Soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous, and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future. Aaaand I'm spent. That was so lame. Bullshit, as my English teacher would say. He is really cool. He made us write about a chair the other day, which was very interesting. And he taught at LOCNAME, which is my ORGNAME. I would love to go to school in LOCNAME. Hopefully next year I can go to ORGNAME and be near PROPNAME and see if this thing will really work out. Are boys the only thing on my mind? Am I really that shallow? At this moment, I'm afraid so. I blanked. I have to start a new stream. I'm losing a lot of weight, I think. My wrists are smaller than they used to be. I don't know why that waifish look appeals to me. I want to be super skinny. And if not eating is how I have to get there, I just might do it. I don't think I'm fat right now. There are just parts of me that could be smaller. And I'm too lazy to work out, so not eating will solve all of these problem areas. I'll be the anorexic that always eats Milky Way. Because those are so good and I could never give them up. When do I become an adult? I have no clue where that came from. But really. When? It's really quiet in here. I can hear PROPNAME typing on occasion. She is a good student. Always on top of things. Our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in. The other day it smelled like Clam Chowder. Not pleasant. I miss my family. I never thought I would. I don't miss them so much that I'd cry or be terribly homesick. I mainly miss the meals. And the fact that if I was sick they would go and buy me what I needed. I took birth control for the first time on Friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me. It made me appreciate my mom so much more, which I rarely do. Yes, I am a spoiled brat. I didn't get as much stuff as other brats did, but I am one nonetheless. And I have no concept of money because I am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in October to go see PROPNAME again. And my mom will be furious at me if she finds out. I'm not going to tell her this time. I'll give PROPNAME all the information. And pray my parents don't come down for a surprise visit. I like our dorm room. It has a lot of character. I love our posters. PROPNAME and I have the same tastes in a lot of things. Of course, I'd much rather have my best friend PROPNAME as a roommate. I miss her so much. And with her, I do miss her to tears. She is the only one I could be myself around. I love her so much. And feel horrible about what I did to her last year. I blew her off. I wasn't a good friend. And I'll never forgive myself for it. The girls across the hall from us just got home. I don't like them that much. PROPNAME is nice. She listens to PROPNAME. And, however stereotypical that is, we think she is gay because of that. Most PROPNAME girls are lesbians. And PROPNAME, the other girl, is really stuck-up. And she listens to lots of local bands from LOCNAME that I despise. So yes. It takes a lot for me to warm-up to people. I'm very selective with friends. Which I shouldn't be because I'm not the coolest person to hang out with. And boy do I have low self-esteem. I constantly put myself down. PROPNAME gets annoyed with it. And I type really hard, too. I think PROPNAME is annoyed with this sound right now. Oh well. Seriously, is someone going to read this? Is there a right or wrong way to do it? I hope not. I'm sure I'm doing it the wrong way. PROPNAME just told me that he is joining the army. I don't want him to. And I told him why. And he told me not to be punk rock because I'm an indie princess. That's so lame. Just because I listen to that kind of music doesn't mean I can't have political views. And this was a good exercise. Very therapeutic. Thank you, Professor! 
__label__label0 Well I'm supposed to write and I don't really know what to say. I'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch TV. I wasn't doing anything productive so I thought I'd get this writing assignment out of the way. Do typos matter? Because I keep erasing, but I don't think it really matters. Ok I left one in. So it's really hot in here. And my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type. But oh well. I'm waiting for the cartoon Home Movies, to come on. I don't usually watch cartoons, but I saw this one once and it's really funny and I liked it a lot. Wow, only 0 minutes have gone by. I think I'm going to get pretty tired after 00 minutes. I'm so sick of studying. My roommate is talking about a little girl in a PROPNAME PROPNAME video. What song is this? I have no idea. I'm hungry, but I can't eat and type at the same time. My side itches. hold on a second. Aw there we go. Much better. So I don't understand why I have so much work to do in my English class. It's ridiculous! It's making me so frustrated. My other classes give decent amounts of work to do, but that class is crazy! I have to read 00 chapters in PROPNAME PROPNAME by Tuesday. Oh I like this song. Probably shouldn't listen to it too loud because I'm trying to type, but it's ok. I seem to be doing ok with it on so far. I'm really tired and I wish I could just go to sleep but I need to study some more before I do. I have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks. Wow, I complain a lot. I don't mean to, but I do. Ok. running out of things to say. Talk about smells. can't smell much. It's pretty plain-smelling in here if that makes sense. Damn! Only 0 minutes have passed! Twenty minutes feels like forever. We did a stream of consciousness paper in LOCNAME LOCNAME in high school and I remember how much my hand hurt while I was doing it. I need a massage. my neck and back are really sore. Maybe from sleeping on a too-small and uncomfortable couch last night. And from driving from College Station (no I wasn't at ORGNAME) to LOCNAME LOCNAME and then to LOCNAME today. That could do it to you! Well I want a pretzel. They're sitting right next to me but I can't get them. When is this thing going to over with? I wonder what you learn from this? How weird and random people are? I think I'm a pretty random person. I used to say that word a lot in middle school. I hated middle school so much. I don't know why. It was just horrible for the most part. And high school wasn't much better. I like college a lot more than both already. Well my show should be coming on soon. I can't wait to watch it. I hope it's a funny episode! I always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that's NOT funny and think I'm stupid. Not that I care, but I want people to know that it's a really funny show. I need to be studying for English. No, not English, music. English just popped into my head. Hmm. Ok only 0 more minutes. I think I can handle this. Wow, it got quiet in here. And really really hot too! At first our A/C was broken and our room was 00 degrees, and we complained that it was too cold. And now they fixed it and it's soooooo hot in here. PROPNAME just discovered Longhorn Delivery. I love that thing! I used to use it all the time when I used to come visit friends in LOCNAME. We were all pretty lazy. I'm becoming less lazy here I think. I have to walk everywhere and can't really rely on other people to do things for me like at home. I want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents. I'm not homesick, but it'll be cool to see how things have changed since I left. My parents have been re-doing the house, probably out of boredom. I think it's cute that they're doing little projects together now. I hope they have fun living together alone again, like before they had me and brother. I've been warned it's almost 00:00 and HOme Movies will be on shortly! I'm excited. I think it's sad to get so excited about a cartoon, but you have to get excited about something! Well my time is almost up aND  I'm glad. Oops, I hit the caps lock for a little bit. Ok 00 seconds. And I'm done! 
__label__label1 I just had a conversation with PROPNAME. She can be so touchy sometimes. It seems as though she is so insecure with herself that she can't stand it when someone says something that is contrary to what she is saying. Just a few minutes before hand, I was telling her about what I need to for this writing assignment and she said that she often writes stream of consciousness" writings and gave me an example where she a friend of hers wanted some advice on a story he was writing and in affect, she gave him a story that was just following her thoughts and that wasn't pre-planned. I told her that that was not "stream-of consciousness" because she was focusing her mind on a particular theme or plot to come up with a story. Then she just got irritated and told me that I don't do that to her. And I was like, "What?". She doesn't make any sense. Oh dear. LOCNAME is screaming her head off and I have to cover her so she can go to sleep tonight. It is 00:00 and she usually starts screaming about now. LOCNAME is a nice bird though, other than the screaming when she is in a demanding mood. She usually keeps herself pretty entertained. There she goes again. I should tell monica to cover her. PROPNAME is probably busy with her studies. How am I supposed to tend to my bird while I am doing this assignment? I have to stay here and complete it or then I wouldn't really be doing the assignment right. That brings up another point. What is someone really has to go to the bathroom during these 00 minutes. Are they supposed to just sit here and risk getting a bladder infection so they may do well on this assignment? Would that be cheating if someone took a bathroom break? Ok, I had to go cover the cage but it didn't take more than five seconds(literally) because the cage is on the other side of the room that I am in. That is a relief. Now she isn't screaming. Now what should I write about. Hmmm. I had a yoga class today. ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was very difficult to do and very fun. I hope to become really flexible this semester. I also have a really good workout schedule planned for this semester. I got a texercise pass from Gregory gym for 00 dollars and I have access to all these cool aerobics classes and yoga classes. It is wonderful. I just wish I didn't have this psychology class at 0:00 to 0pm because two really good classes go on at that time. It is really disappointing. I can't believe I am taking a psychology class(000) this late into my undergrad. I am a senior and I am just taking this class because I decided just recently I want to go into Counseling Psychology. And in order to do that I need 0 Psychology classes with a "B" or higher. I am going to make an A in this class. This summer had a large effect on me. I realized that I really didn't want to become a professor and be consumed by grading papers and research and not have adequate time with my family. I think I just spelled that "adequate" word incorrectly. I hope this assignment isn't going to be graded on spelling. That would be ridiculous because this is a "stream of consciousness" paper. What if a persons stream of consciousness is going insane and causing the person to type faster than normal to get every thought down and in the process spell words incorrectly. This page doesn't have a spell checker. People are so spoiled by spell checkers and typing. Have you noticed that everyone has bad handwriting these days because no one really needs to master the art of writing? My sister told me that when she was little she used to practice her handwriting all the time so it would look nice when she would have to write papers. That seems so ancient now and that was only about 00 or 00 years ago. Its crazy how technology has progressed so rapidly within the past few years. What is going to happen next? I will tell what will happen next. We will overpopulate to the point where there will be no trees or animals left. The earth will be polluted and humans will be the cause of their own demise. I think they should study that in psychology. Why are humans the only animal that makes its environment adapt to it rather than it adapt to its surroundings? We are the only animal that is ruining earth and eating up all its resources. We are causing a great imbalance in nature. Would they even be able to study that in psychology? That might be a little taboo because everyone is so full of themselves that they don't want to admit how ridiculous humans are. or rather, can be. I really like sociology and anthropology better than psychology. Or at least I have more experience in those other two areas. I tend to take the middle ground however. I am not like a psychologist saying that a lot of aspects of human behavior is biological and I am not like a sociologist saying that every aspect of human behavior is a product of environment. I think it is a combination of both and it seems like to me that both fields are too extremist. Am I going to get a bad grade for badmouthing psychology? I hope not. Psychology is a good field, don't get me wrong, but one has to remember that everything has its faults. I took that horrible pre-test today for the experiments. Some of the questions were funny to me. I think its great that they want to know how interested a person is in erotica. Haha. My 00 minutes are over. Guess you don't get to read about my opinions on erotica. 
__label__label0 I begin by wondering exactly what purpose this assignment serves. I also wonder what will pass as the year goes on. Caffeine. I suddenly have a craving for caffeine. I would get up and grab a Dr. Pepper, but that would interrupt my writing process. What would it be like to be known as Dr. PROPNAME?  Do I really intend to go through with getting my doctorate?  And if so, what happens afterwards?  It boggles the mind to think of the ways in which I may change over the next several years. Wow, I certainly am typing fast. On my old computer, there would have been a delay between the time I pushed the keys and when they appeared on the screen. I very much like this new flatscreen, it certainly goes well with my new system. Every computer I build has some odd quirk to it that no other system demonstrates. It may be my fondness for ORGNAME video cards, or it could be my personality reflecting in the way that I put these things together. All in all, the system works well, but there are times when I just want to drop-kick it out the window. That, however would involve opening the blinds, which would expose me to the eye-squinting sunlight. I have always rather disliked the direct sunlight, partly because it is directly associated with heat. I can stand heat when it causes immediate, measurable pain, such as the burning of a hot pan handle. However, the discomfort of extended exposure to the hot, sticky, mind-numbing LOCNAME sun can drive me insane!  There is a point after which I do not care, but sometimes it seems as if that point never comes. ORGNAME is certainly a subjective concept to the human brain. The saying Time flies when you're having fun" is absolutely true in this respect. If only it were the other way around: uncomfortable situations seem shorter, and the pleasant experiences extended. Alas, that is merely wishful thinking. My roommate's girlfriend just called three times within a 00-minute period. Ah, there he is. "The ol' ball and chain just called", says I. What an interesting concept this telephone is. From pretty much anywhere in the world, you can have instant contact with anyone else that has a similar device. Of course, there is a slight delay due to the limits of the speed of light, but as long as you are on LOCNAME, this is a relatively slight matter. Last week, I spent time with my family looking at Mars in my dad's telescope. Mars will not be closer for next to 000 years, and it hasn't been this close in nearly 00,000 years. From what I have read and heard, though, it has been within a few hundred miles of this distance in the last several years. Calling last week an especially special occasion is barely the truth. The difference is like standing in LOCNAME, walking 00 steps towards LOCNAME LOCNAME, and saying that it looks closer. One-hundred odd miles in over thirty-four million?  Absurd!  Looking at the timer, it appears to be about time to wrap it up. Wow, I just had to correct my spelling on the fly about ten times. I guess that it's not as easy to type correctly when there is another person in the room. 
__label__label1 It is really bright in here. Maybe I should turn on of the lights off. I would except I'm writing a stream of consciousness. I really miss PROPNAME. I just talked to him about 00 minutes ago, but I need to talk to him again. Boy, is my cell phone bill going to be high this month. Haha. I still haven't paid mom for last months bill. I probably should have read chapter 0 before starting this, since it is due tomorrow and this isn't due until the 00th, but I would more than likely had waiting until the last minute if I hadn't gotten this over now. Whoops. My poster looks like it is about to fall down. Oh well, I'm to tired to go and put it back up. Yet, I am still awake enough to sit here and type for 00 minutes. I wonder how much people write for this if they are slow typers. And I wonder if they read every one of these. Especially since mine is going to be so long because of my typing speed. Man, if I were a slow typer this would be a lot less work. And if I wasn't so diligent about punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Haha. Instead of spelling I accidentally wrote sleeping and had to erase it. I wonder if that is my subconscious trying to tell me something. I'm so glad I finished that photo wall. It turned out really nice, but PROPNAME didn't seem to like it too much because she didn't have quite as many pictures as I did to put up. Oh well, that's her problem. Man, my DVD's are really out of order. I'm not sure why I think they need to be in any order at all, because in the grand scheme of things, that really doesn't matter quite that much. You know what would really suck would be if my computer, out of the blue caught a virus while I was in the middle of this, and I would have to start all over again. Then I would just wait until the last minute and probably not type quite so much. Oh well, this is for science I guess. Man I really really miss PROPNAME. I can't believe I got so upset today when I was driving home, but what can you do when you love somebody so much. I don't know how his brother is related to him, he is so strange. At least he is nice I guess. I wonder if his blindness was caused from his genes or from some other problem when he was born. I guess that really isn't my business, but I'm just so damn curious. PROPNAME didn't seem to know, so I guess I'll never find out unless I ask him, and I don't know him quite well enough to do that. Man, my pinky is really starting to cramp up. I don't think I've written for 0 minutes straight before without taking a break. I hope my Calculus quiz tomorrow isn't bad, I did the homework and everything and my professor swears that it is enough preparation for his quizzes, but yet I still remain cynical. I guess I'll just go over the homework problems again before I go to sleep. I can't wait until that ORGNAME's show comes on A and E. Wow, I was so lazy I didn't even bother to find the and symbol. Haha. I did it again. If I wasn't on this laptop I wouldn't have a problem finding it. I wish it came with a 00 key pad. PROPNAME. PROPNAME. I can't stop thinking about that boy. He is such a sweet heart, and I can't wait to finish college so I can spend all my time with him. I wonder where A & E is. Haha. I found the & symbol. I wonder if there is some way that I can find out the channels on the internet through ORGNAME's website. Man this is a hell of a lot of typing. Hey hey, I see my Monkees bobble heads. They are so strangely entertaining. That's the only reason why I'm going to watch the ORGNAME special, (davy jones is on it wahoo). That, and because PROPNAME said he was going to watch it. There's the picture I have of us!  I can't stop looking at it or thinking about him!  I'm sure whoever (if anyone) reads this will wonder who PROPNAME is (though it's pretty obvious). I hope PROPNAME allows him to stay over at his dorm so he can come visit next weekend, and I don't have to drive back to LOCNAME LOCNAME again. I don't mind driving down there, it might just be nice to have a change of scenery and have PROPNAME visit up here. I'm going to be so worried about him though because he has to wait until he gets off of work to drive up here. There are to many drunk people out on the street for him to be safe, even though I trust his driving abilities. I think I'll have him call periodically on his way up here, just so I know that he is alright. Ya, that's a good idea. I should probably go and put those batteries into my remote but I don't want to get up and find it, nor am I suppose to get up from this typing and do something else. Man, PROPNAME drank all my Hi-C. Or did I drink it all?  Naw. Steph did. I distinctly remember having at least 0 left in there when I left on Thursday. I don't drink her stuff. Oh wait, I did but she told me I could have some. Man, that whip cream I got on my face earlier from the Frappacino still hasn't come off after washing my face twice. I can still smell it. Eww. It smells like babies vomit. PROPNAME!  Why aren't you here with me right now!  I know why you aren't here, but I wish you were!  Someday I won't have to worry about where you are all the time, and wonder what you are doing, but for right now this is torture!  Especially since I am writing all my thoughts down, and these thoughts of you are more obvious to me than normal!  All the thought I have in-between are meaningless because I don't consciously notice them, but when I'm thinking about you it takes all my concentration and full attention!  I should probably try and not think about missing you during class, but I can't stop. IT isn't like I don't mind these ideas, I just know that I won't be paying attention to what I should be. Hurray I'm almost out of time. 00 minutes. and a few seconds. Steph needs to put her stuff away and keep it away from my side of room. What is up with this. I'm not going to clean up after her. I'm getting so annoyed with her sleeping habits, but what can I do. I love you Byron!  I want to drive up there right now but I can't because of class! 
__label__label1 I am typing this paper because I have to. My roommate is asleep. I am listening to Incubus music. I am listening to Incubus. I just got off the phone with my girlfriend. She was annoying me. She was saying all this stuff about how I was flirting with this fat girl. And I was like what I did not flirt with the fat girl. And we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument. But in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good. The music I am listening to is so good I love listening to them. I am so mad. I did  my Calculus homework tonight and I missed a few problems. It makes me angry because my roommate and I both know Calculus and I should have gotten them all right. I missed a few which was stupid, but I corrected them. But still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid. If you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points. Which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a -000 to a 000 which makes no sense. I am so mad at this stupid grading system. Because then I can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot. I am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it. And I messed up on my homework so it is not a good night. I cannot wait for this week to be over. I am having a bad week. The song I am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type. I really have to go to the bathroom. I wish I could go. Oh well, the music is good. I really like this writing assignment because I can write about whatever I want. I wish all writing assignments were like this. It is so cool to be able to write about anything. I love writing about what I am thinking, it is almost like a diary. It is good to be able to write about my feelings, I think this assignment is very good. I hope my girlfriend is not mad, I just thought about that. We talked tonight, and I think she might be mad with some of the stuff that I told her. I really hope she is not because I love her with all my heart, I hope she is nor going to blow anything  
__label__label1 Okay, I just got done chatting with a guy who I  had some classes with in high school. I have not talked to him in a few months. He is doing well but is going to Tech. What a mistake. I was also thinking about yesterday because it marked one year since I'd left for LOCNAME. I can't believe it was a year ago yesterday when I started my time there. I miss it so much and would love to return. There are so many things the country has to offer and see. Granted there are lots of political problems and I just received the other day from the Embassay down there a letter that said there are cases of Yellow fever ( or something like that) in some of the states. I was down there for 00 months. I lived with two families. I went with the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I had a rough time for a few months. The hardest time was when there was a nation-wide strike which lasted for 0 months!  Everything during that time was shut down. Companies stop producing. Ran out of harina pan y cervezas. Tenemos q hablar en ingles o es espanol bien?  Quiero practicar escribiendo mi espanol porque ahora aqui no hay muchas vezes donde puedo escribir cual cosa en espanol. My spanish is not perfect. Far from it. I have been speaking for about 0-0 months now. The first 0 months I was there I spoke mostly English. That is a horrible thing to do if you are trying to learn another language. One reason I didn't learn in the first four months was because the first host family that I had lived with spoke English, and there family members spoke english. I met so many people who knew english. That is awful for me because everyone wanted to speak and practice there english with me. I wanted to practice spanish. When I would try and speak in spanish with my host family they would respond to me in English. So the first 0 months weren't the best. I started to learn slowly thought once I made more friends and once I had switched families. My second family was great!  My host mom was so nice to me and she would always talk to me and be more involved with me. I started speaking and understanding the language more. So by the time I left I had been speaking spanish for about 0 months, I wonder how much better I would be if I had spoke and learned during the first four mouths. I broke away from the Rotary program in June and traveled alone for that month. No one could travel with me, that was okay though because I was not going to miss out on seeing LOCNAME for that reason. One reason why no one could go with me was because there was no money and the eco system had gotten so bad because of that shit head president PROPNAME. He even stopped selling american dollars. So I had to end up paying the black market prices for my trips that I went on in June, because the trips where priced in dollars. Well I paid because its a once in a life time opportunity. I went to LOCNAME. It was truly breathtaking!  I was so shocked to see how beautiful something could be. I absolute loved it and wished someone was there to share that sight with me. Well, in LOCNAME there are lots of waterfalls. I went to the famous Angel Waterfalls which are the tallest in the world. It was amazing!  I had to take a four hour bout ride there and then it was an hour walk up to the falls. They were great, spectacular. I truly recommend going there and at least once in your life. I also went to ORGNAME ORGNAME, which is the frog or toad falls. I got to walk underneath the waterfall!   It was like in the movie The Last of the Mohicans but 000 times better!   That was my favorite part. I also went to a National Park called ORGNAME. They have the best beaches and little islands. I went to the islands which were basically empty only for the people who went there during the day. It was gorgeous. Beautiful clear water, great blue sky. I loved ever second. I also made it out to LOCNAME which is not part of LOCNAME but its only a 00 min plane ride from the city I had lived in. LOCNAME was like the islands in MOrroccoy that I had gone to. IT had a great night life atmosphere as well. I had a blast!  I can't wait to go back and visit all of LOCNAME!  I miss all the wonderful, kind people there. I returned the 0 of July, and have been back for 0 months. I miss it but I have to get my college started here. Can't wait till I have money to go back. College is free there here its too damn much. I already have way to much in loans, I won't say how much but let me say you could buy a good car with the amount I have in loans. Well Ciao!  PROPNAME PROPNAME  PROPNAME PROPNAME! Te Amo y Extrano!  PROPNAME       
__label__label0 hmmmm, I wonder how many people I a m going to meet , some persons painting her toe nails, what color? red I think not looking     I'm hearing this guy and girl talk about classes. I thought all my classes seemed pretty hard but there not. so I think I have back problems. used to wrestle, do weights now, can't squat though, back hurts to much, these beds suck ass, jesters at least. I just got a blanket, a feathered blanket, its pretty nice. Oh, and I also got some new blue sheets, I think I want to go to sleep, but I can't cause I can't go to sleep. Woah! I'm so glad I only need to do this for twenty minutes, these are all random sentences and the punctuation all wrong and I am so behind on my readings for your class. ORGNAME ORGNAME in my first class. I have noticed I don't like raising my hand because I'm afraid of being wrong. Making out in public, that is just bad karma. I met these real pretty girls but for some reasons I only want to be everyone's friend. I need an envelope, I need to pay rent wow I like nintendo, the games, how simple they are. I'm going to join the ORGNAME. it seems pretty interesting but I don't know about 00 bucks. COLLEGE IS SO COOL, some of these dorms smell bad though. Not as bad as my house though cause I left the stove on overnight and the whole apartment smelt like burnt pizza. I'm so tired of working. I want to stop this timer right now though. I need to pay rent. wondering if my breath smells. posters, I need a poster. something blue. laredo. I hate girls, sometimes, I guess really I'm just jealous cause they get a lot of stuff handed to them just because they are women. I want to go to the beach again, or at least move back to LOCNAME. sometimes I think I am losing my mind, but then I take a few breathes. I also want to join wrestling, maybe rugby when I am older. I need to clean my room. I bought candles and I think I need the buy some more things. I have enough food though. hungry, hungry, hungry. Apartments are awesome. mannnnnnnnn. twenty minutes, this stuffs easy when you have something to write about or not when you have nothing to write. (sigh) 
__label__label0 hmmm interesting clock. I didn't know there would be a clock timing me while I was doing this. I can't ummm. ummmmm,. ummmm. hmmmm. wonder if lunch with elon today will be good I mean. I wonder if we'll have a good conversation because the past times we've talked it seems we always run out of conversation . geee my feet feel kinda sweaty. its nice in the room but yet my feet feel sweaty must be the humidity setting on the air conditioning. Probably will tell dad the next time I meet him. Wondering how he will react when I tell him that I gave the guitar away. He will probably get mad but I have to try not to worry too much about what's going to happen and just trust in God who will help me. If God asked me to do it, I trust He will help me through whatever difficulty my faith may take me. Feet still sweaty. Times is ticking but I'm typing like I have a clock to beat. Ooh minimum number of words kinda thing. Wonder how ben is doing haven't mailed Him in a long time. Must be busy with his girlfriend or something like that. Hmmm I he still working in the botanical gardens. Don't know why I think that he is working in the zoo when he actually is working in a place with virtually no animals. Man my hair is getting in my face and all that. I didn't know I could type so fast with two fingers. Wait I need to tie my hair right. Ah ok that is not much better. Why do they have  all the state capitols in a monthly planner. Thinking of something to write. Gee me feet are still sweaty. Maybe its some psychological thing. Thinking again of what to type. Hmmm I really should go and learn how to type properly and not just with four fingers. weird. Hmmm dog is sitting in the sun. Weird! He is hotter than most humans are and yet he still likes to sit out in the sun. Don't think he is cold blooded or anything like that. Hmm wonder what this letter is all about. 00000-0000. Full zip-code. Hmm the finish button looks good to click on. Hmmm what is this thing with humans and pushing buttons. Is there like some nerve in the brain that gives you the feeling of wanting to push buttons. I guess that is how people get into trouble. Push a button. Boom! Nuclear missile hits some other country. ok thinking of something to right. Man I have a lot of gas. Stream of consciousness writing. How could I really be type at the stream of my consciousness its like trying to chase a bullet train or something. Tap tap. Thinking of something. Hmmm rachel. scratch face. wonder what is going on between me and rachel. Will it never be over. Scratch ear. What's this tingling feeling I have in my feet. Weird it's gone. Man I feel like farting but I can't cause I'm afraid I'll poo in my pants. This is ridiculous I can imagine the person who gets to read this would be thinking what's up with this nutter. But then again I guess he is done it before so what he is thinking about is probably as crazy as the next person. Think I'll say hi. Hey sherlock. that should be right, right? He is the writing czar. what is a writing czar? its not like some kinda nazi right? Cause that would be scary. The writing nazi. Man I thinking I really need to go to the bathroom. Ok only 00 secs left. Hang in there. What? hmmm bleur! gah! woo hoo I'm almost done. till the next time. Good bye! 
__label__label1 I find it hard to write what I am thinking probably because I am always thinking of several things and it is hard to focus on one. But this weekend's events seem to come to mind. I had a really fun weekend. It is not just that I hate school and I needed a break, I honestly don't feel like I am really in college. I just feel like I am going through the motions. It hasn't really set in yet. But right not I am at a friends apartment where a couple of my friends and I have stayed these past couple of nights. A friend is watching Office Space in the background and I love that movie. It is a great movie and I find it amazing how you can relate much of your life to that movie. I just realized how dramatic I find my life. I make a big deal out of little things. I guess it is my way of dealing with the stress in my life. I make things into a huge deal so it seems too ridiculous to be upset about something that it doesn't bother me anymore. Especially when it comes to boys. I find them to be a huge headache. When a relationship doesn't work out I find it easier to be upset and hurt about it and make it not a big deal because once I am finished ranting and raving, it seems kind of silly. Besides it is easier to be upset at someone than it is to try and get over those feelings you had for them. But the thing about that is you can't hate them. Because in order to hate someone you have to have significantly cared for them at one time or another. The people that hurt you the most are the people that are the closest to you. And I don't want to the people I am mad to know that they have impacted my life to the extent where I am capable of hating them for hurting me. I don't know, it may sound complicated, but it works for me. Some people think I am a very complicated person, but I don't think I am. I consider myself to be an honest person and in return I expect your honesty in return. Don't bother lying to me. Don't waste my time. Time is always something that I lack. There aren't enough hours in the day. Ever since college I find myself sleeping at doing homework and hanging out at odd hours of the day. Just yesterday my friends and I went to 0th Street, went to eat and then came back to our friends apartment to swim at 0:00 in the morning. But I guess that is college. I am really looking forward to what the year holds for me. People here in LOCNAME are really nice. There are some weirdoes, but overall I like it here. I think I made the right decision about college. Life is great. It really is. 
__label__label1 wow I really need to shower but I'm going to go work out later so that is ok. maybe tim will come and abbey and mike, they would be so cute. I don't know though but I'm glad tim called me yesterday. the flowers aunt michelle sent me are getting old where should I put them, I guess in the waste basket thing by the stairs. I wish I could use those but every time I go down for lunch you can't get in from that staircase, its annoying. I'm really hungry. I was not supposed to eat the snickers and kit kats but I mean I practically had vegetables for lunch so its ok, plus its the weekend soon and I don't want to waste it. I forgot to go draw my tickets, I never know when to go. I should look it up soon but I can't go now because sunny and abbey have not given me their IDs and its probably too late anyway. and lets see only like an hour till psychology, I want to sleep but ate the candy so I'd stay awake and its working I mean I'm a little tired but not too much. I went to bed around like 0 last night but I wanted to study more, but my roommate was sleeping and she gets mad or annoyed sometimes when I turn on the light, like its a spotlight on her or something. anyway kinda pisses me off and I have to do everything in the dark which takes forever, I have to brush my teeth, take my pills, do my nose drops, lots of stuff. and then she wakes up really early - well she had a class, but she didn't wake up to her alarm and I did. and then when she left it went off again and I still had an hour to sleep before I had to get up to get dressed. it was cool though. my room is nice and clean now, the maid lady came because she forgot to come yesterday. I can't really do this if my roommate is in here, oh well. she is about to come in, I hope I can focus! this is really hard to think of things to say because I have never really paid attention to my stream of consciousness. I don't know if I'll be able to draw my tickets tomorrow because my classes are in the morning and I don't know what time it closes. probably all sold out anyway, so many people here. but its funny because I'm not meeting as many people as I'd like to, but I have only gone to like one frat so. I'm glad I met tim though, that was kind of random and he is really cute. and abbey seems to like mike, who really likes her, and they would be cute too. but abbeys is either changing a lot or living a lie, she goes to frats like 0 times a week, its crazy. and I have been friends wither her for like 00 years so I know she procrastinates so I hope she gets her work done. I don't think she is though because she always says she has hw and then leaves to go party or something, whatever though. we might go get coffee later at barnes n noble, its such a far walk. I don't need coffee either but I think abbey thinks I'm mad at her so I'm going to go anyway and just study I guess. I mean I knew college was a lot of studying but I didn't think it'd be this much. maybe because I'm such a slow reader. I only read about 00 pages per hour. and in the textbook its only 00 per hour. its so slow and so many pages. I finally finished the psychology homework like 0 hours ago, it was sort of interesting but I hope the next chapters are better. I don't think I'm retaining anything. which is bad because I read for so long that you'd think I'd be learning it. I get psychology confused with philosophy and then can't seem to remember either of them. but in class I listen and I get it, then after I try to think about it and all my classes run together. yesterday was especially bad because I got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment. I made a 00 and it really pissed me off because I worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and I trusted it. he also didn't do some examples on the board correctly, which made me get another one wrong. today he was all ?oops? yeah it made me mad. but oh well I can drop it according to the syllabus that I don't have printed out. I hope whoever reads this does not think I'm a psycho or anything, or can't spell because its either a typo or I just don't spell well. I really am a good student though and I'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and I have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off, and it sucked. I was in the bathroom at kerby lane and I cried when I told my dad, I always do that. its good that I have bangs now because if I were to cry or not pluck which I need to do, you can't tell that much. I'm funny about crying, I do it when something really touches my heart, which is kind of often I guess. but pain wise I'm pretty tough, I played basketball for so long. I'm so accident or injury prone. I swear I always get hurt. at the football game that hurt so much when I stepped on that glass I think there was still some in my foot but beth said there was not. it does not hurt anymore so that is alright. I just hope everything goes well for me I mean I really wanted a 0. 0 gpa but now I'm scared. maybe being scared will hinder my performance, so ill stop worrying about it and just trust that I'm smart enough. twenty minutes is almost up. 
__label__label1 Well, here I am; doing a paper that was assigned weeks ago hours before it is due. I do not know what it is that causes me to procrastinate as much as I do. Lack of sleep, maybe. Laziness, probably. I consider myself a good student, but when it comes to doing papers or projects I always put it off until the last minute. I just got home tonight, its past midnight, and I am tired. I really want to go to sleep so I am not dead during classes tomorrow. I am worried about how things are going to work out grade-wise. This is my first experience with a grading system such as college, with so much emphasis placed on tests and very few other grades. Pretty much all my classes are going well, but I am not sure how I am going to study for exams. However, I think that if I keep up my study habits that got me here, I will do just fine. I am really hungry right now because lunch was my last meal and I do not want to eat now because apparently it is bad for you to eat before you sleep. My eating habits worry me too now. Three solid meals a day used to do it for me, but now breakfast is gone and one large meal a day is usually all I go for. My head itches a lot now that my hair has grown out. I really love music. No matter how my day is going, there is always a song out there that can raise my spirits. I enjoy all different kinds, and I have listen to a variety since I have started writing. It is quite weird now that I think about it, but music is one of the only things that can truly mellow me out. I have always been a calm, collected person but there is just something about it that I truly love. The whole college experience has been great so far. I love the campus, the professors, and the people. Most of my professors give great lectures, and class is actually enjoyable now. I almost look forward to each new school day now that I'm at the University. Being on my own and experiencing what life has out there is so awesome, but there are times that I wish I was still back home in high school, not worrying about anything. 
__label__label1 Wow, I really don't feel like typing for 00 minutes, especially because I can't type all that well. My foot really itches. It is so hot in here, my roommates keep the air up way to high. My hands are sweating, and it takes a lot fir me to sweat. I feel terrible. I really hope that I'm not getting sick. MY nose really itches. BAD! sniffle. I really miss PROPNAME. I wish he were here right now. Now my elbow itches. And my nose again. This commercial is so gross. I would run the other direction too. my legs are sweaty too. I wonder if the sweat will mess up my keyboard. I wonder where Ky is. gahh I really hope he doesn't like me. He is cool but I just don't want to go past friendship. My eyebrow itches too. man, stuff really itches when you are paying attention to yourself. My shoulder and nose both do. I have a lot of knots in my shoulders too. Maybe PROPNAME will I have me a massage when I go home this weekend. That hair is on my nerves. I have so much reading to do, I don't think I will ever get caught up. I am really worried about PROPNAME. I hope she can get everything figured out money wise and also with her math. I don't know what I would do if she weren't here. Man my hands are sweaty, it is so hot in here. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing. He is having that dumb study group at his house tonight so I probably won't be able to talk to him that much. I love him. I wish he would be able to come here and visit. His parents would never let that happen. He is coming to the LOCNAME game so maybe him and his dad can come see my place. My arm itches. Now the other one does, and my shoulder. I have a lot of knots. It felt great for them to be rubbed. My nose itches. I am so stopped up. There comes the air, maybe it will cool off. PROPNAME must keep her air on like 00. I cannot type at all! my legs are stuck to this leather couch. I really need to go to PROPNAME's to use her nair. My foot itches. I really need to go work out. I cannot gain weight this year. I need to shave too. I have so much that I need to do, but there's no way I can do it all. My hands are still sweating, but it feels better now that the air came on. Only 0 more minutes. This sweat better not mess up my computer. There goes PROPNAME's alarm. My eye itches but I can't scratch it because of my make-up. I have to change the TV. felicity just gets on my nerves. My ear itches. and my thigh. and my other ear. and my eye. wow! oooh Friends is on. but so is Trading Spaces. I love that show. Genevieve really gets on my nerves. Oh this is the kids version ugh I sneezed. I guess I will watch Friends now. Oh my 00 minutes is up! yay I can stop     
__label__label1 I have been asked to do similar exercises in the past in which I was supposed to just write nonstop and track my thoughts or create a story, a cell phone is going off right now but it is not mine, I just got a brand new phone, it is a really cool camera phone, sometimes I hate having my cell phone because people just won't stop calling me and it gets really irritating, especially if you don't want to speak to the person who keeps calling you. I met this one girl PROPNAME, and she called me so many times but the problem was I was trying to avoid her because I was not' really interested in her. But I didn't want to hurt her feelings because I know there are times when I have felt lonely or hurt myself. Anyways I would rather too many people call me then nobody call me. Last year I didn't have a cell phone and I wasn't really as socially active as much as people expected me to be or as much as my friends were. I really hate the keyboard that I am typing on. I am in the library right now, in the RLM building, I came here to come to a spanish class to see if I could get into a class I wasn't registered for. I promised my mom I would come and check this class out because most of my classes right now are not to difficult and I have a lot of time. Something I am not really used to. Anyways my mom has been bugging me about taking a foreign language for some time now because she desperately wants me to learn something. she owns a translation company and thinks it is vital that I be able to communicate at least in Spanish if I am going to live in texas. I really do agree with her but I don't really want to learn a foreign language. I took french in high school and it was really tough. but maybe that was because I didn't really work hard my first two years of high school and I never really paid attention in class. Maybe I will be better now. Anyways before when I was asked to do similar assignments I never was really able to write anything down. I remember one time I was asked to just write nonstop and then later what ever I wrote about I would use later for the topic of a story. The problem is that I really wasn't able to write anything down at all. Usually when I write something I like to think long and hard about what I am writing about and then phrase whatever I am writing in a very articulate and cleaver way. I am really hungry right now, I never ate breakfast. I usually don't eat breakfast but I usually don't' get up this late on the weekdays. I had a rough night last night. couldn't fall asleep and I didn't wake up till 00:00. I had a class at one otherwise I might have slept later. There are some people passing by me and I keep looking over wishing for some reason that I recognized them or that they went to my high school. my eating pattern since I got to college has taken a weird pattern-back to my no breakfast-I have 00 meal tickets back at the dorm but a lot of times I will only use 0-00 of my meals a week and that is being generous. the first week I had 00 meals left, last week I had 0 or 0 meals left. I am trying to get my brother to come to towers and eat with me, he can use one of my tickets but he won't come because 0 years ago he got kicked out of towers and I guess he is afraid of going back. somebody must have really scared him or something because fear or boundaries are not usually things that get in edward's way. he has no problem breaking rules or trespassing or anything like that if he wants something or wants to have a good time. He is by no means a bad person, he just doesn't like to be told what he can and can't do if he doesn't agree or approve of limitations he also can not work on someone else's time schedule. He use to be different, he use to be such a little goody good, he would follow all the rules and stuff like that he was such a wimp, I use to hate him when we were little and then other times I would love him but mostly I would hate him. Now I think he is one of my best friends-I think that this is because ever since I have been around him in the last year or so he has been really great and accommodating to me, he always makes me feel good and tries to make me feel welcome and special, my parents will say the exact opposite about him, they will say he is selfish and inconsiderate-they fight a lot-and in a lot of ways they are exactly right but in other ways they don't see things that I see. I am really grateful to my brother because in a lot of ways since I have been around him he has somehow taught me how to relax and have a good time. My parents will say that this is his specialty-relaxing and having a good time-they think he is really lazy and can't    be bothered to ever move, but actually I have noticed that when edward wants something he will do whatever is necessary to accomplish his task, since I've been in LOCNAME it has been him who has called me several times to play tennis, and he also is surrounded by his friends and by women-this is not by chance. well my 00 minutes already passed 
__label__label1 Ok so here I am sitting here writing what I am thinking. crap forgot to look at the clock. ook 0:00. kinda took me a while. analog clocks. hey what did the digital clock say to the analog clock?  look ma, no hands!  yea that is pretty lame but it just popped into my mind. hah I almost wrote pooped into my mind. that would been shitty. does anyone care if I write curse words?  because I think in curse words all the time. dammit my eye itches. alrighty that is a little better ok I'm still just writing not really thinking about what I'm writing or at least trying not too because I keep making all kinds of spelling errors. I can type fairly fast but when I do its fairly shitty. I keep making mistakes and having to go back and erase my mistakes so it kinda takes away from my train of thought. or stream of consciousness (sp?) as u call it. I'm not really a psychologist type person. I'm only taking this class because it sounded like the least boring of the 00 or so choices I had. plus I could tell my friends why they are so stupid. or, well, that was my original plan. I don't know now, but it still seems fairly interesting. I'm not trying to kiss ass there like I sometimes do, and am fairly good at by the way, I really think its interesting, for them most part. like the lie detector test. I found out how to beat on of those things. just lie a lot, then tell the truth occasionally and switch it up enough that it confuses the shit outta the machine. and also make sure that the investigator person does not know whether your lying or telling the truth, you know kinda play stupid. lie when you don't need to. tell the truth but make it sound like a lie. convince yourself its a lie even though you know its the truth. heh my foot itches. reminds me of that time in class you were talking about this assignment. whenever you mention this stream of consciousness writing my foot always itches because you had that stupid itch comment. it was not really stupid just annoying and it bugs me and it was annoying. and it still is. hey my typing has gotten somewhat better of the the last few minutes probably because I'm not concentration so much of fixing my mistakes. so you'll just have to live with all my shitty typos so there ha!  yoo can't stop me because you just said write what on your mind and what if there are a lot of rtypes in my mind?  hihn?  huh?  what u going to do about that?  this charis too low. there we go that is better but now it won't rock. htere fixed that too ok now this is linda wierd because my legds are pusing against the bottom of the desk which sucks because/ I can't lean bakc as much. and my wrists are stargting to get tired because they have nothing to lean on. I have no where for mu wrists theya re ruined! damn my desk for now havign a wrist rest. ok this chari is too high now. and mt arpmits are sweating and I have no idea why. thta happens a lot and I hate it. it makes me look like a nervous fool evcen if I am. ok chair lowered back to where it origicnlly was ok now I'm not even looking at the words I type I'm just staring at my fingers as they type the words and not relallyt thinking about what I'm typeing that sit be interesting to see wat kinda crasyt shit comes of out omy  head I know what kind of mistakes I'm makeing but I'm trying tnot tot chrorect thim and now I'm tryinf nor ro ecen hink just let my ifngers flow and let them do the talkjing not me oand now my eytes are closed that is not workingbla bla bla bla bla I'm still writing now how do u like that?  ur not even going to read therse are you?  I just know it your just doing this for some reason that no one knows yeet but it will be so obvious after u explain it that everyone or at least me will fdeel stupid. u know kinda like that lie detector tesxzt. if u had explained it before then it wouldnt have worked. if I knew how a lie detector test worked then it wouldnt really be that hard to beat. and since u said that they're so accurate, that is making us think that they work all the time so then if we ever get convicted of a crime, or at least on trieal then we'll think that the lie detector works and we won't be able to fool it but then you told ous how it worked and so now we know that is it is not har as accurate as u originally tol us that it would be ok maybe I should just randomyl type letters and see what comes out I'm fsitting here typeing words onto my computer screen and I really doint beel like isttint here typing words I really want to be sleeping of playing counterstaiek or fucking my girldfirend. ytes that last one idont know wny trs last but that sounds really good right now, don't u think. /  but you have a wife I'm sure that uve been doing for a long time so it kinda lost its spart me and meagan have been together 0 years and have been fucking for one yea she thot that she would wait till he was married but yea that is just jddidnt turn out and its not like I forced her we just did it one day without really thinking about it and it was good and I'm getting a little hard now just thinking aobut it myabe I shouldnt be tell ing u this shit but hey u asked its ur own fault if u don't like what I'm witing mmm yea that sex sessions sounds really gfood right now I wish she was here. shed kinda bubm tho so she is goin to acc but hopefully she will be smart enough to transger to a good skoo like ut next year and we can get an appartment together and fuck all the fuck we want. that wousld be fun I would like that. come home after a long day of school to come in my woman  yea, tat would be nice. are you still following me?  hey my roommate just walked in es in his air force unouiform hold on I'm going to explain to him what I'm doing ok no I'm not he didn't ask so he problably does not carel;  ill assume he does not care. aww I stopped thinking about meagan and my erection went away now I see what u mean about how himans can just think about a ember of the opposite sex ad get ariysed but then they can be in the same room as them an not be. let me tell u that does not happen that often. the second one that is. us being together and me not wanting to jumop on her. unless we;kre fighting or my friends are around. either of those. ok my roommate is talking on the phone and its kinda distracting me ookk he is done now well I think its beed 00 minutes I just looked at my watch and yteal I think tis 00 minutes, 0:00  ok cya in class oink 
__label__label0 words are pouring out like endless rain into a paper cup they (?). but I like to use     periods. before, I was tempted to say, last night my ears met their lover. too bad they     didn't. haven't?  I just wanted to use that nice quote I stole from an editor of epitonic. I     have an hour till I have to go to LINK but I really don't know about this whole Christian     organization on campus thing I need to find one that fits me!  oh thoughts and feelings     sometimes I stare out at nothing in particular and it's in those times that I am thinking     about absolutely nothing oh I just got a call. but I'm still typing!  darn you booksellers call     back after nine thirty. I wonder if typos make a difference because I don't like leaving     them behind like that, so careless. So, I need to get a haircut. But how do I know which     kind?  You know, some people just look good no matter what. I think it's a level of     achievement that I will never reach. Oh well. What if people were the same inside and     outside?  Like, for example, if all the pretty people were extremely good souls. Now that'd     make things different. I can't really imagine what it'd be like, because I'm so busy thinking     about what I should write next. Man, what should I pursue?  My stomach is really full. I     used to think that if I ever smoked, I could quit anytime, just because it seems so gross. Well I can't even moderate my eating habits. And I bash myself about it, but when hunger     calls, I respond. In full!  So yeah. Sometimes I fear for my safety when I'm walking around     at night. Nothing ever bad has ever happened but I think I should still be careful. But I     don't think so enough since I'm going to do it tonight anyway. I'm going to watch the     LOCNAME at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Theatre. Yeah. Hey. I wonder if I'm going to make     any good friends here at college. It's bad hanging out with old ones all the time, and     believe me, sometimes I just don't want to. Excuse me. I just sneezed. What if I do really     think in sentences?  I think I have a cold. My nose is rubbed pretty raw (well, not really)     from all the tissues. I'm not thinking about anything. Actually, what I would like is to     complete everything I need to get done soon. I don't know how possible that might be but     then that would leave me time to do leisurely activities, like reading and responding to     other people's e-mails. I'm so bad at that. And so I could have time to read the Bible and     pray. Ah, I cannot control what I do, or at least I'm not trying hard enough. It seems so     easy to be a good Christian when the pastor is talking about it but then laziness gets the     best of me. Oh I can wait. You know, I don't want to think I'm invincible. I want to make a     difference and experience life fully. The things I am most scared about now: public     speaking. I just want to die when all eyes are on me- the bigger the audience, the more     humiliating. You know, it's not like I can control how I feel, to an extent at least. I am also     afraid of getting into a car accident because my close friends just did and it seems     unbearable, the time in the hospital spent recovering. So many tubes. I'd cry out. And I'm     afraid of falling off my bike or getting into some other bike related accident. It's not so     much the pain that bothers me, but the public scene it would cause. How embarrassing. Oh well. Sometimes I don't care what other people think. Sometimes I wonder what they     think of me. When I'm shy, I tend to come across as being mean. I haven't really opened     up to anyone before. Why should I if I don't trust them or if I'm not sure that they care     about what I feel or think. I think I'm good at observing people in their behaviors. When     I'm talking to someone, I can tell if they lose interest in what I'm saying. At that very     moment when they look away for a second. I don't feel bad when that happens but it just     makes me lower the probability of me finding someone or some people who can connect     with me. I know. People need people. And I need a tissue right now. Is this going to be     read?  If it is, it's okay. I don't know if my thoughts are interesting, but it would be a fun     thing to grade. I feel like I'm spending less quality time when I'm reading out of my     textbooks. I want to go back, but then I just get this feeling of urgency. Even when I'm     surfing the net. Imagine that. What do I have to do anyway?  What's the difference     between an erection and an ejaculation?  I think I might know, but it doesn't matter so     much to me. I don't like it how professors can say whatever they want to say, like curse     words and sex related and other inappropriate topics. Just because they can talk about it     doesn't mean they should. Sheesh. I also don't like how repeated exposure to talk I don't     agree with and cuss words will desensitize me to it completely, probably by the end of the     semester. Here I am in college and I don't know everyone but a lot of them are making me     less pure. I don't think they realize what they're doing to the rest of us. What rest of us,     you ask?  I guess we are a minority then. I wonder what I'm going to do for the final     project in my freshman seminar. Either fencing, a Christian organization on campus, if I     ever find a good one!  or a concert. Although a concert might be kinda difficult since I'm     not going to one until October 0th. Yay for Beulah!  I'm so excited. When I go to shows, I     feel like I belong. I don't know anyone there, but I like to observe them. Most of them     have styles. I wish I had a style. I want to be like them. Or do I?  I want to be like me!  But,     I need to be more like me then. Maybe if I had a lot more money. I do have a lot of     money. What does being fashionable feel like?   Not as great as I think, of course. It just     hurts to see people wearing things out of fashion when they think they are in fashion. We     are the elite. At least my mind can distinguish between the two. But only street. What do     I make of myself then?  It's easy not to care, but it's not so easy to do that completely. Will     that make people like me more?  Is it easy to avoid everyone and keep to myself?  Is that     what we were meant to do?  The answer is no. What if it's different for me?  Everyone dies     alone, right PROPNAME?  I think I need clothes to reach the next level. Of making me satisfied. Oh, if I had a different body. No, no. That's alright then. People who know you don't care. It's the people you are trying to impress who care!  Hah. I wonder if I ever hurt anyone's     eyes. It pains me to think so. Before I left for college, at the goodbye dinner thrown for     me by my uncle, the message in my fortune cookie (or rather, one of them) was be     yourself and you will always be in fashion. "  I suppose that's valid. Ooh I can continue     writing. Maybe for a bit longer. I wonder what it would be like to be very fashionable. I     mean, come on, I already struggle against feelings of superiority when it comes to music. What good does it do?  There are always better, there are always worse. But I won't say any     more about that. You know, I can't give all of myself away    and to a stranger!         (ok, I finished editing my paper)_ do you think that this (spilling out thoughts on paper) is     healthy for all of us?  not that it's not, but compared to making no difference    I think so. 
__label__label0 This is the psychology writing assignment. I hear people talking and I do not like what they are saying I have so much to do today, and I've already done so much. what am I going to do when I get home. I think I'm hungry but I don't feel faint like usual. I want to talk to matt about things but then again he just gets upset. more talking that I don't want to hear. there is training going on and he seems to be annoyed with the guy. like I'm annoyed. I wonder if carol has written me back. this is actually a weird assignment, but very easy, my fingers are getting tired because I type quite fast. I know I have some mistakes but I doubt the professor cares. I met some guy in class the other day. his name is, well I shouldn't tell you the name. he draws stuff. that reminds me he gave me a website to go visit and I don't have it with me. that's a bummer, huih? I wonder what bill is doing. I shouldn't be thinking about him, I should be thinking about mat. matt matt matt. I know that guy that just walked in. he was in my mis class and he was annoying. why do I keep saying that word. annoying annoying annoying in my head. I'm really not like that and it's only been 0 minutes writing. what if someone can't type very well and they do this assignment. their brain processes stuff faster than what they are typing. I bet they would only get a few lines out before time was up. what is the point of this experiment. I would like to know professor! anyhow I'm still hungry I just want to vedge out because I've been at school all day long and it's already 0:00 in the evening. I want to go home but I'd rather not ride the bus. you know this morning the bus was so crowded. stop talking man! I want you to shut up. this guy is always in the computer lab. he mentioned that he went to college but never managed to graduate and now he works here. I don't know what I think about that. At first I felt sorry for him. Old ORGNAME. must go there to return some clothes that doesn't fit me, not because they're too small, but because I bought them one size too big. That's not like me I bought the clothes in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I know and now I'm returning them here. I think it was definitely an impulse buy. I bought a shirt that had #00 on there. oh god, it's only been 0 minutes. this is way too long. this is going to give me what is it calle? carpal tunnel syndrome. thanks a lot prof! I'm just hungry don't mind me. I actually talk to myself that's great to know. matt told me he thought I talked to myself, but I only do it when n someone is in the room because I know that person is listening. my sister on the other hand, talks to herself. in the shower, while getting ready, while doing something. she doesn't realize it, I don't think. and now she is a professor at a community college in san antonio, where my parents live. I'm actually kind of scared of what I might write here today because now there is 0 minutes left. can't wait for this to be over over over. yesterday I felt horrible. it was just a bad day all together and I recently took that pretest thing that 000 requires. it made me think of all this stuff I don't want to think about. I wonder if I'm really crazy and the survey is going to tell me that. like they would send me an e-mail saying  thank you for participating, and you're crazy" "go see a psychiatrist" yeah that's what they would do. well they wouldn't because everything is so damn professional now a days. you have to sign consent forms and give up your unborn child and all that stuff. I wonder if I'm being funny. prof, if you're reading this, you must have a lot of time on your hands. that guy that asked me if he could borrow my pen. he had some thing on his head. it looked like pantyhose tied at the back. what is that? what's that for? I don't even think that prevents you from getting hot or cold. it's one of those fashion things I obviously I don't understand. yeah things are too strict now. you can't do things you used to and people feel "safer" but it's just a lot of fear building up that's going to explode one of these days. how sad is that? I hope I'm in another country when it all blows up. I don't even think people realize it because not everyone is thinking that way. they just live their lives and not care. like people who don't vote. I just think that kind of indifference is why the country is going to s#$@#$ yeah I'm not going to cuss here. I bet you're having a good time with this, professor pennebaker. ok now there is only 0 minutes left and counting. whoohoo! I can't wait to go home. I've done all this crap online today because my internet does not work at home on my computer. it works on my roommate's but not mind. that's just a bunch of crap. that reminds me, I should get a netzero customer service number while I have the internet available. I bet it's dark outside. what am I having for dinner? sometimes I just have popcorn for dinner. isn't that sad? I just don't have that much money to be spending here and there. oooh. but yesterday I did buy chik fil a for lunch. that might have been a bad move because I was feeling nauseated after that. it's not good when you have to sit through an hour and 00 minute class. yes that's yours, professor! I like your class though. it's so different from what I've taken here at LOCNAME and I've taken A LOT, believe me! I just think this whole pre=health thing that I am doing is just me trying to prove something to myself (first and foremost) and to others. I just want to know that I can do it. I think the profession I want to go into, optometry, is a good profession. I think I spend a lot of time slacking off. sometimes I'm really down on myself and I'm very hard on myself. I  wish I were not like that but what are you going to do? at least I'm not like I was last fall. I was such a mess. my survey will probably prove that. it was a very dark time in my life. yesterday part of that came back and that is why yesterday was not such a good day. I cried like I used to cry last year and it wasn't like me. I thought a lot of that aspect of healing was over, but I guess every once and awhile it comes back. I just have this feeling that she is not gone and she is going to somehow come back into my life. is this supposed to make me feel better? well gosh darnet it's working. I usually don't say things like "gosh darnet" but today must be your lucky day, professor pennebaker. I like that last name. I bet you have a lot of fun with that. I'm curious to hear what music is played tomorrow before class starts. uh oh only one minute left. better make the rest of this good. mmmm. chicken tenders. that's what I wanted last night but was too lazy to drive and get it. I'm not that much a lazy person. I worked out on sunday morning and am still sore from it. that means I'm supposed to work out today. only 00 seconds left I hope you've learned a lot from me prof. because you won't set     
__label__label0 Well, lets see, what am I thinking. All I ever really have time to think about is school. I am so stressed out, since I changed to pre-pharm my courses have completely changed, I'm reading for hours each day and I'm not a big reader", I read very slow, and I have absolutely no reading comprehension what so ever. To top it all off I have three tests on the same day, this one is two days before that and I have another one the thursday before that. Talk about brain overload. One thing that's good is that a lot of the science stuff I'm reading in all 0 classes and some of it I'm finding in my psych readings too. It's all just overwhelming. This week I have to do all this lil sis stuff for my sorority. I was supposed to decorate her room yesterday but I had class from 00-0 so she was home when I was done with class, so I'll be doing that later and I have to buy all this stuff for it too, I don't have a job, I don't make money, and I don't feel like I should ask my parents for more. The big money problem started with my boyfriend, he owes me $000, that's a lot of money I could really use. I could maybe go and do something for myself, go out to eat occasionally, go rent a movie once and a while but no, I have all this other crap I have to pay for like bills and he can't understand that. He is not in school, he should a job, why to I have to loan him money, well no more-EVER. Well at least not until I get my money back. To top it all off he messed up something with probation and now he is in jail, I don't a boyfriend who's in jail, I want someone with my same goals in mind, someone in school, someone who cares about where they'll be in 0-00 years. But it's so hard because I love him, or at least I think it's love, it has to be or else I wouldn't put up with all his crap. It's not just all that, I'm somewhat of a neat freak and I like things to be clean and keep things the way I have them but everytime he does something that upsets me and not just that, it's stuff I've asked to either do or not do hundreds of times and he somehow thinks that he can get mad because I'm mad at him, well if would listen to me and try to clean up after himself and common courtesy things like that I would even get upset. Now he keeps saying are things going to ok when I get out blah, blah, blah. I don't know if things don't think at least somewhat better than I can't put myself through this anymore, the stress he causes is probably close to or equal to what I get from school, I don't need that-school is a big enough pain in my side. I should probably end it, I know I won't cry-I'll miss him but I've already cried enough for him. You know the saying-the only guy worth crying for will never make you cry. I don't know we'll just have to see what things are like. One good thing that came from him is my kitty, PROPNAME. One of his friends couldn't keep her so I took her. She is the cutest most mischievous thing ever. I feel so bad though, she got spayed and declawed on monday. She is doing better she is walking almost completely back to normal, not really limping anymore but I still feel bad, I didn't do it to hurt her but I know sometimes she is in pain. That was pretty costly too, she is an expensive little thing but hopefully that'll be the last big thing I have to do for her. She is about 0 months but she is still relatively small, I'm hoping she will be a petite kitty and not get too big. The world's biggest cat weighed 00 pounds, I can't believe that some girls at school probably weigh around that size. I just think that's incredible. Wow, my hands are starting to hurt from typing, good thing this is almost over, and done. 
__label__label1 this is really boring, I'm so tired, I think I might take a nap after this but I have to write my social work notes. I wonder what will is doing in his class right now, I think this exercise will show that I think about him too much. I wonder if stacey is in class. did angel get the message I sent to her cell phone? should I go home this weekend? if I go home, I think I'll want to stay there, but if I don't go home I'll miss seeing my lil brother and I know he really wants to see me, its a good thing I haven't told him I'm thinking about it yet. I really want to get me and will tickets to the football game and to the austin city limits music fest. I wonder if by getting him tickets I'm encouraging him to ditch class. I don't want to encourage him to do that, I want him to do well more than anything because I know that he wants out of ORGNAME so bad. I hope that he stops hanging out with that arthur kid so much, that kid is trouble. he isn't going anywhere. will has so much potential to go so many places, and arthur is just going to drag him down. omg its only been three minutes. this is crazy, I type fast and there is going to be so much stuff here. I wonder if my hands will hurt at the end of this. I guess it is keeping me awake. I'm so tired, I just want to sleep once in awhile. I actually did sleep last night, I only woke up once I think. its so hard to sleep, I don't know why. its probably because of this horrible dorm, with its horrible smells, horrible neighbors, and the massive amounts of noise associated with traffic outside. I was so tired that I took a freakin nap at russ and will's apt. awwww. russ is so awesome, I think he might be one of the best people I know. I wish more guys were like russ. I wish will would start being more like russ and a lot less like arthur. arthur is so dull. who in their right mind only thinks about parties, drinking, and easy girls? he is so one dimensional, and will is so much more than that. I wish he could make more friends that actually have substance. I wish I could make more friends too. oh, I made a friend today in sociology. I let her borrow my notes since she said she wasn't in class. slept through or something. that sucks. I hope I don't do that, but since I have no friends here, its not really a possibility right now. man, I feel like such a pathetic loser here. I have friends, I really do, I keep telling myself this. but I don't think anyone here believes me. I walk around all alone all day, and only talk to people when I have to. its such a pathetic existence. then I come back, study, run errands or work out, eat, and sleep. I talk to my friends online a lot, and on the phone a lot. I wish they were here. I hope that russ and will are here next year, and that nicki, stacey, maris, kayla, tracy, and everyone ends up here. maybe plunkett will too, that would be fun. I wonder how he is. I hope he is ok. he doesn't talk to me too much. I think he probably does miss having everyone around. I wonder if marc is ok. I think underneath his happy front he is the saddest person I know. weird. he is a great person though, good heart, good intentions, doesn't always follow through though. man, I wish I was back in january. january was the start of an awesome semester of high school. I think I was actually popular in high school, which is weird to think about. I was never like the prom queen or anything, but I had about a ton of friends, and I knew they were all loyal. they were so great, they still are great. I miss hanging out with my guys. they were so much fun this summer. craziness. and my girls, I want to go dancing with them. there are so many clubs here, and it would be so much fun if we all went. but for some reason, its not as much fun going with ppl I don't really know that well, and don't care to hang out with. like christyn soland. ha, I was actually glad that she went to san antonio with me this weekend. I felt kinda bad for ditching the YL ppl, but I think it would have been awkward for them with me around, esp since they think so horribly of me. I don't want to be around ppl that hate me anyways, or are fake friends to my face. I don't know, I tend to bash her a lot, and esp will does too. we hate her mutually, ha. damn, we should just go out or something. I can't believe his mom thought we were. I can't believe everyone thought we were. that is so strange, I wonder what he thought about it, but he didn't seem to care at all when stacey told him. he kinda just stared at us with an apathetic look on his face. I wonder where that frame I made him went. he seemed to really think it was cool. I'm so glad we got to go to lunch and hang out. I really want him to be here with me next year, but more than that I want him to get out of ORGNAME and be somewhere he really wants to be, whether that be here or not. I wonder if he wore that burnt orange polo to the game last week. I hope we get to go to a game together, that would be so much fun. we have fun together I think. I can't believe that I miss everyone so much, and I can't believe that I care about him so much, as a person, as a friend. its scary. its like the whole robby thing. robby. I wonder how he is. I can't believe he had a girlfriend. I wonder if he still does. he was such a great guy, he still is I'm sure. he thinks he has to define himself now by drugs or smoking or horrible music. I'm not understanding that. I wonder if wonkie is doing the same thing? I can't believe she would smoke. I bet she couldn't believe I would drink. why does armando think I would give it up to will. I may like the guy, but that doesn't mean I want to jump in a bed with him. I hope he was just kidding. I wonder why robby went off the deep end and pushed everyone away. I hope that doesn't happen to will, I hope he doesn't push me away. if he pushes me away, he has arthur left, and russ, but he will push russ too I'm sure if he pushes me. I hope that arthur falls off a cliff and breaks both his legs and arms, and has to leave ORGNAME so that he doesn't ruin will. I hope that he doesn't kill him. it made me almost cry when russ was kidding about that. it makes me so worried when he says he doesn't mind getting into a car with drunk arthur. I know he knows its wrong. does he think trying to validate it to me will make it ok? what would I do if he died and I was the last one to talk to him, and I knew he got in a car with a drunk arthur? I would feel guilty. but there's nothing I could do about it. I couldn't stop him. there's no way. he is making decisions on his own now. well I don't think he is doing a very good job of it. why does he tell ppl that he got high or drunk and decided to go to utsa? I know he remembers that it was me saying he should go for it. I convinced him to go there, like he convinced me to go here, and now we're both not happy. I think I handle it better. I don't know that running away to san antonio to see him/everyone is better, but at least I'm not screwing things up by being drunk all the time and fo 
__label__label1 Hmmm. lets see well nothing is really going on. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 00:00 because I have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. I have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. Also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. I am also scared that  by tomorrow I will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. I have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so I guess I should go. I kind of miss my room at home. It is hard to have to share a room with someone. This is the first time I have never had a room all to myself. Sometimes I wish the room was just mine but I am ok with it because I know it is good to have a room mate. PROPNAME is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. I really need to work out but I cannot because of this sinus infection that I have. When I run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. How that works, I don't know. I was thinking about it. How can sinus fluid hurt your face. I could ask the doctor, but I am too lazy to listen to the answer so I won't. Hmmm. whatever is on my mind. I really have a lot of studying to do. It is 00:00 in the morning and I woke up just to study. Getting this done though makes me feel as if I have gotten something accomplished. I like that feeling of accomplishment. Everytime you do something you get a check. Chapter 0: Check, Chapter 0: Check. The check feels really good. I don't know why it feels so good but it does. I am kind of concerned right now about the time. This clock on the computer is really off but I am using it anyway. I just have to time 00 minutes right? I have ten minutes left. I have rally never known how to spell the word minute. I don't even know if that is right. For all I know that could be the for minute(as in small) I even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless I was talking about music, it wasn't. So for now I just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though I just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling I typed it wrong. I am actually a good speller, I promise. I just get confused sometimes. This it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. I guess I will type about something interesting. Hmmmm lets see. I really want PROPNAME(sp) to do that recording test on me. The one where is records every five minutes. (See there that word is ageing) I really would like to know what is going on in my life. So far this is what I think is going on but I am not really sure. I am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. I need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. I am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: I stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. I don't have a football ticket. I think I might go to LOCNAME LOCNAME instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. He is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. I thought I might cheer him up. It makes my grandma up set so I though she could use some cheering up too. And this is why I need to take the Recording test. Because I hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that I do not realize. It has been 00 minutes- good bye. 
__label__label1 Right now I'm feeling overwhelmed at all the work that has been given to me. There is so much reading that I have to get done and so little time with all the classes I am taking. Right now I am thinking of a way to manage my time and get everything done. Right now I am hearing dead silence as my roommates and I are all studying in the same room. I am also hearing the fan and the doors slam from others people who are down the hall from me. Right now I am feeling very tired and my eyes are about to shut but I'm trying my best to stay awake. As I type, I'm thinking about other work that needs to be done by tomorrow and wondering if I'm ever going to get that done tonight. At this instant I'm noticing how  there are so many pictures of friends in front of me and how much I miss them. I'm wondering about how tomorrow's classes are going to be and what other will be assigned for that day. I am also thinking about how hard my classes are and how I am going to pass them. I'm trying to figure out a way to manage my time, a way to prevent me from procrastinate, and a way to stay in control with my study habits. Right now I also feel sad because I really miss my family. It's so hard for me to be away from them because I'm so close to them. I especially miss my little bother and little sister. They always make me laugh. Today my day was tough. I hardly understood what was going on in there so I had to stay after class and ask questions. As for my critical thinking seminar, I had a hard time participating mainly because of what the topic was about. Right now I'm hearing no noise at all and it's just making me tired. I feel very cold right now because the fan is right in front of me and it's making my eyes dry.         
__label__label1 It's only the second week of school, actually the first full week and I'm already so stressed out from studying. I'm not sure exactly how to study but I'm learning. I think maybe I should just make study guides so that's what I'm doing. Oh my gosh, I got to eat at the nicest restaurant last night, TrueLuck's. It was so good and I had such a good time. This past Saturday I wanted to go home so bad and was trying to get my boyfriend to come meet me in LOCNAME to eat. It didn't happen but in the long run I'm glad because I finally made some friends. I'm the kind of person who likes to have a lot of friends to hang out with and usually they are mostly guys. Though this doesn't much help my boyfriend's peace of mind. I'm not sure my roommate is that way but whatever. Anyway, well I met these really cool guys who I really like hanging out with. Sometimes I don't think PROPNAME likes them as much and it pisses me off because it makes me feel like she thinks I'm wrong to hang with guys because I have a boyfriend and so does she and well we're just really different. Well these guys ended up needing dates to a dinner for their fraternity so we said we'd go, I think PROPNAME only said yes because she had been drinking. Well I had so much fun and the guy I went with turned out to be really nice. It was great to finally go out and do something with people. I feel more at home now. Now to my boyfriend. We were best friends for 0 years before we even thought about dating. I love him so much and although I'm only 00 I pretty much believe he's the guy I'm suppose to be with when I get married. But my going away to college has been hard on both of us and in some ways harder on him. I understand that he's back home and doing the same things he's done for 0 years so he doesn't have as many things to keep his mind of missing me as I do but before we never argued and now he's always mad at me about something. He makes me feel awful when I go out and I know he doesn't mean to but it happens. He can't understand where I'm coming from. The guy I dated never cried every night and now he does and it gets depressing and makes me feel guilty. I want to have fun here without knowing that he's at home mad or crying. He's not the crying type of guy so I just don't understand. I love him more than anything and he should realize that, that is all that matters. No other guy here will ever take his place but that doesn't mean that I won't make other guy friends and go out with them. I don't even look at guys the same way because of Brent. My life here does not mean that what I feel in my heart is suddenly going to change. I just wish that he would go back to being the same Brent as before I left but I know that it is going to take time and I just need to realize this just as much as he needs to realize how bad he's making me feel. It's a compromise situation but I think everyone should have to go through this because if we're still together in the long run I know our relationship will be just that much stronger. I'm going home this weekend and I can't wait finally I can show Brent that my feelings for him are the same and I get to see my mom and sister. I have to go to my dad's and since he just moved out a few weeks ago it will be my first time to go and I'm not really looking forward to it. I want things to go back to normal with my family. The way it's suppose to be. If there is such a thing. The months before coming to college were so hard and stressful that at times I'm glad I'm here and away from all of it. At least I don't have to listen to the screaming and fighting. I wish my mom would try to fight for my dad and like lose weight or something. But she's being stupid. I miss my sister so much and my dog Tinker. My sister and I are so close we might as well be twins so I hate being away from her. 
__label__label1 Yesterday, I went tubing with my family on the LOCNAME river. It was a blast!  It was the first time since I moved to college on Ague. 00th that I have spent time with my mom and sister. They are the two people that I miss the most back home and I was so happy and relaxed to get to spend time with them. I also got to see my little baby puppy bichon frise named PROPNAME who is absolutely spoiled rotten. It was weird going home and sleeping in my own bed for a night but it was also a great get away from school to just hang out with my family. I guess that I have been putting off any kind of homesickness by staying busy with school and trying to meet as many people as possible. I find that the more that I see my family the more I think about them and get sad so. I am refraining from going home for just that reason. I am waiting to find out if I am going to get an interview from the ORGNAME ORGNAME and I have mixed feelings on whether or not I want to join. Part of my doesn't want to be joining an organization I am not 000% interested just because I am looking to meet some new cool people, but on the other hand I need to get involved in something at ORGNAME so that I can find so sense of belonging in this large school. I definitely am worried that if I get busy with an organization I would overstress about my classes and meeting the clubs requirements as a member. Deep down I know that most of my worries are pretty trivial compared to most peoples problems. I know that I am  very lucky just to get the chance to go to college and that is why I am so concerned on whether or not I am going to blow it. I am very concerned about my Chemistry class and I  have been thinking about how much I need to study all weekend. . Well, two classes ago we discussed on a scale from 0-00, what is your fear of death. My feels like it is 00. This is not because I lack a faith that their is a higher being or an after life, it is because I am afraid of losing someone I care about while I am away at school. I have been thinking a lot about a friend of mine who was going to be a sophomore at LOCNAME this year who passes away suddenly from a pulmonary embolism/clot. I am now grieving the loss of someone so young and so beautiful that I feel that my sense of security has been ripped away from me. I am now thinking if someone so healthy and young can lose their life so suddenly, whose to say that the couldn't be my brother/sister or mother/father. I guess that you could say that I am one of those people who worry to much and I worry that I will lose someone again and I wouldn't have had the chance to say goodbye. Anyways, this all sounds so childish and "heavy" for an 00 year old college student to be thinking about. Well I am so happy that these 00 min. have flown by and I can get to my real homework. It really felt go to get all of my thoughts out in a way that was quick and easy. I hope that I can get all of my work done tonight so that I don't get behind this week. This was a great assignment, I would not mind doing more of these. Have a great day!   
__label__label1 Well where should I start. First of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that I have ever had to do. I'm not even sure what to write about. My day started at 0:00 today because I have an 0 o'clock class which is really fun. not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less. then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun. then I had a break from 00 to 0:00 which would really suck if I didn't have plans. so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I'm flag football team. well anyway, I'm not even sure if I'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today. any way I really enjoyed today's material in class. at first I wasn't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now. Considering that I have and extremely hot instructor for my ORGNAME 000 class. Its crazy hot attractive she is. But now I'm thinking about another girl that I have a crush on. Today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates. I'm not sure if she knows how I feel, but I'm having a hard time reading her. Usually I'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier. I also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because I had been wanting to talk to them for a while. Things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes. I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind. On yeah, I got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad. My dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work. My mom called on her way to a Bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl I have crush on this weekend since she is going home Friday. anyway crush is such a high school word now, what I really meant was girl I'm attracted to. What's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since I was in 00th grade. and every time she would tell me I would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that I'm into her it kind of sucks because now I have to put much more effort into it. Now don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to make it seem like I'm am lazy but I truly am not used to putting in so much work. I know it may sound cockeye but if it does I'm sorry, please don't think of me like that. what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or I'll type and you'll read later. 
__label__label1 o. k, so now I'm writing for this assignment. I'm going to turn off the music I'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, I like new order. I like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. I'm probably more into that than most people I know. I wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night I ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. I totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and I crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and I hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was "bamn" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that I still live at home, I still live at home. I'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but I'd like to have my own place. but I don't have the money for that because I pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but I do feel good when I say that to other people, usually at work is when I do that. I work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. I got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that I could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. I keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a "how are you" exchange. things are going better with my parents and I. there was a time before ut,(I'm a transfer from acc)where I didn't really care much about things. probably because I wasn't being challenged, except from work which I enjoyed/enjoy. anyway, I was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob PROPNAME type stuff. I have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although I wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. I stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. I wish I was done now. funny because I was looking forward to doing this, but I thought it would be more of a stop/start thought process. it seems like I'm just narrating my last couple of days. I was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and I am somewhat. wish I had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, I have to write for an entire twenty minutes. I wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this. my face is all rough and "treated". I have avg acne, not really the worst I've had. I am using treatment though which helps. my mom just went into the laundry room which I assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean. because I told her that I would clean it last night because I went on a bike ride instead. in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time. but for some reason I like wasting time. there she goes back into the laundry room. and no comment, but no inspection either. I have a good view from the office room where I am typing this twenty minute thing. itching my eye felt good. my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position. now that I noticed that, I noticed I'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to PROPNAME gym and how I can't really yet because I am a gimp. Not really though, I could easily tough it out, I'm competitive and athletic, or use to be. sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years. I knew I'd miss high school for that reason. I like when I repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when I typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance. I was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than I had expected in the end. ok, that was interesting, something I don't really want to do again, or do I? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing. ok, finished. 
__label__label0 Well, I'm 00 years old now and I'm in college. So far it has been kind of boring really and I still have not received my math book so that kind of ruins everything. Ok not everything but it's not a good thing and wow 00 minutes is a long time. I want to watch this show on television but  I guess I won't so let's see what else I am thinking. The dryer is kind of loud and only 0 minutes have passed since I've been typing nonsense. School is also exhausting. I take naps like everyday and you know I actually like writing about nothing because why?  Hmm. Well, because I'm not stuck with a certain topic and I just have to decide what to write about. I would talk about smell but there is nothing exquisite in the air right now if that makes any sense. However, about 0 hour ago I was eating meatloaf that my brother made and it was pretty good but now I'm hungry again because I didn't have much to eat. So I'm thinking of going to ORGNAME and getting some delicious Mocha Frappucino. Is that spelt with 0 or 0 "c's". Anyways before I go to ORGNAME I may go to the weight room hopefully not the one at ORGNAME because I may still have other assignments to attend to and UT is too far of a distance. Man I wonder what time ORGNAME is closed. I also want some ice cream. I sure hope that I don't gain the Freshman 00 because that would really suck. I hope that doesn't offend whomever has to read this because I didn't mean to. I sure hope that I learn to manage my time later on or sooner actually. My throat or something hurts and I wish that I could just sleep all day. I hate some of my classes and I hate being in the Gateway Program. It's alright but not what I expected. I definitely didn't expect to take a class for that program but I am stuck in the most boring of boring classrooms. I feel like what am I doing there and can I get out of the program without hurting the Coordinator?  Also, when should I try to get out of the program?  0 more minutes to go. what to talk about? what to talk about?  Oh yeah, I had a fever last week and I hope that I don't get sick again this year. Another thing about the Gateway program is that I have to go to some social events and that takes time out of my life. I definitely don't know what to do. They like helped me register or whatever and I have to wait 0 hours and 00 minutes on MWF before my last class on those days which is Psychology and I have no idea what to do during that time and I tend to feel drowsy or sleepy during that class. Sorry. 0 more minutes. I'm looking at this sheet and I have no idea what to do with my UT email address and how to get into it. Does that make me dumb?  I wonder if I'm even going to get a response for that question. yeah 0 more seconds.  
__label__label1 I am beginning to think I am committing to too many activities. I want to be involved, but maybe I am doing too much-   I wish I did not have eight o'clock class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I hate having to get up early-   I need to buy my Chemistry book and Biology book still. Books are so expensive-oh well-   I am excited for the football game this weekend!  It will be nice to have Monday off-   It smells like Lucky Charms-probably because I just ate some-   I need to get a transcript request from quad C to transfer my chem class from this summer to here-   I need to go by TOPS pics to look at pics from the other night-   I need to call my camper back-   I should do some reading for my classes tomorrow-   I am excited to do the SHINE program for the nursing school. I wonder who my professor that I get to help out will be. I need to look up hospital info online so I can decide where and when to volunteer this semester-   The people who live above me constantly make loud noises- are they obese people or just loud stomping walkers?-   I can't decide if I want to get my nutrition book- the teacher does not require it-but it may be beneficial-   I need to get some more picture frames for my room- I love pictures-   I am excited about a new skirt I bought today-wow I really got a good deal on it-   I like shopping too much-ever since I have been in college I feel like it has become an addiction-from school supplies to clothes-   I love how random my thoughts are right now-   I need to talk to my parents about sorority stuff and my credit card- that was a bummer when I got denied today at the coop-I should have just used my other card-oh well-   I can't decide if I want to go to the ranch this weekend-it seems pointless to go but then again it is only an hour away-hmmm   I want to download some ringtones after this-   I can't believe it's almost September- wow the summer flew by-pretty soon it will be Christmas-   I love hanging out with Katy-she is so sweet-   I can't wait to go to the rodeo sometime this year-   My neck has been itching lately in a random spot- I wonder why-   It would be fun to go on a random date-I wonder who will be first-Brandon or myself-hopefully myself-I need to be able to move on, but yet with a friend-   It's going to be kind of random meeting up with PROPNAME PROPNAME and she wants to sit with us-of course ORGNAME is already busy-I bet that is the only reason she has called- I hate when girls do that-girls need to learn time management with friends and guys too!     I want to lay out by the pool tomorrow-hopefully it will be nice and sunny -         
__label__label0 Well, this assignment is interesting. I don't think I have ever attempted to write for 00 minutes straight. I wonder if I have ADHD or ADD or if its just because I am a drummer. Wow! I have only gone for a minute and I am already bored. Um. I was watching the Cowboy game and they won 00-00. Vinyl did well but threw an interception. I think he will be good this year as lond as he doesn't get hurt. He has a good delivery and is really good at reading defenses. Speaking of defenses (I doubt this has any relation) but anyways I didn't make the hockey team today and it was really disappointing. I really wanted to make it and thought that I had a decent chance. Maybe I gave myself too much credit. Maybe I am not big enough or something. I wish I could have made it but I suppose that one was up to the coach and God. Speaking of God (random again) I went to a really neat church last Sunday. Its name is Glad Tidings. It is an assembly of God Church (although I am Lutheran I think it might be a good match because it has really awesome worship and the pastor gives interesting sermons). I miss my old church though. My youth minister back home is getting ordained this weekend. I am unsure if I should go home this weekend. I don't know. I think I will stay here because I really want to force myself to become independent even though that would entail me doing the laundry this weekend. I am really tired tonight but I suppose I will do my best to continue typing the entire 00 minutes. But along the thought of the laundry business. I have tried to hold off on doing it until next weekend (was going to do this weekend but I think I can make it until then). It has been really hot lately. It was brutal last Saturday trying to run in the morning. It was so humid. It eventually rained but not until after the practice. I have never been so sore in my life. I am still sore but I guess it doesn't matter seeing as I am not going to be playing for the team. I suppose it is sort of a waste but maybe I will try and keep in shape. I don't know though. We will see. Well I am half-way there. I am still tired and I am finding this assignment very boring and I suppose that would imply that my thoughts are boring. Kind of sad I suppose. I wish I weren't so lonely tonight. Just me and the TV. A horrible invention it is. Ruins relationships and limits time for many individuals. But I suppose it helps many escape. I like to escape by playing video games. I think I might play one in a few minutes when I get done with this thing. But yaw. I really like my playstation and probably spend too much time on it but it is really fun and entertaining. I am still tired. Still tired but only about 0 minutes to go! Hurray! This makes me excited. I didn't have an antecedent before the "this" nor did I there but that was because I quoted the previous mistake. I wonder who just walked by my room. It sounded like two girls. I wonder if there really is a girl out there for me. Probably. I hope so. One can only hope can't one? It's funny, I accidentally made a typo and said can't none which if one thought about it logically would produce the same effect but if one thought about it from a LOCNAME perspective it would have the opposite negative and depressing effect. I hope for the logical. I heard a Papa PROPNAME's commercial. I wonder how they can claim they have "better ingredients, or better pizza?" It is subjective I would think. There is another weather report on TV. I find it interesting that people watch weather reports as if they could do anything to alter them (I usually just go with the flow). The flow of the easy river I guess. It is 00 o'clock. Only a minute left. Here's my chance to say something deep. I really can't think of anything but live the Golden rule and you will find yourself a better person. Love is all you need as PROPNAME said (the Beatle of course. Lol). That's it! 
__label__label1 WELL I GUESS I CAN START WITH MY DREAM LAST NIGHT SINCE THAT IS WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ALL DAY. it WAS SO CRAZY. I had a dream that I was sitting on the couch in my room and talking with a friend when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door. I open the door and it is a dark figure, like a person, but the lighting in my apartment was that of the time of day that dusk sets in. Well she walks I and covers my mouth and lays me down on the floor and holds me with all force while she is chanting some mysterious chant in my ear. I don't know what she was saying but at that point I wake up in my dream as I'm struggling to move my body. I couldn't move until I realized I was out of my dream, which was maybe 0 seconds later. How creepy is that. When I woke up the chant was repeating in my head for like 00 seconds and then I completely forgot it. I don't know what that was about but it seems to me that it has to do with someone putting a spell on me. I've felt ghosts before but I never felt a bad sense coming from them. Weird. I always wonder what dreams are really supposed to mean. I mean people can buy dream books all they want but what are the chances of those interpretations being the same for all of us? I am a little worried about that but I haven't really been a bad person in the past with anyone. That I can think of. Oh well. Anyways I have to really buckle down today and do some serious studying if I want to enjoy the weekend like I should. Hopefully I will be studying on the beach Saturday night. Not that the LOCNAME LOCNAME beach ids that beautiful. After going to LOCNAME for a week though I guess its hard to actually top that beach. That was the best time I believe in my life so far. It is good to know that I will be going on many more trips like that considering how easy it was to plan that trip. Saving the money was super hard but I feel like if I really want to do something I am capable of making that happen. I hope this weekend is as good as last weekend. I am going back to LOCNAME LOCNAME to see my family since it has been two weeks since my last visit. I really love the night life over here though. Maybe because everything is so new over here and I really love change period. I am not scared to completely change my patterns in friendships and relationships for that matter. I came over here knowing 0 people in the whole city. Now I know just a few more but the possibility of me meeting so many more is very high on the scale. I really miss my best friend a lot though. Her and I hung out all summer together, and all last year in school for that matter. She was all I needed and I was the same for her. Now we are spirited and she's getting back with her boyfriend and will probably end up married with children. Its a sad world when you see people you love so dependant on the wrong things at the wrong time. Her relationship with that boy is so lame. Thank god I have no time for stuff like that right now. I cannot relate to her attachment to him and would love to keep it that way for a really long time. Hopefully she will snap out of it though and realize that her whole life is ahead of her. Man. This is a really long time to be typing straight on the computer. Everyone around me is getting annoyed by how much I am typing. They keep staring at me, then the screen and back to me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Lets  see well I've been trying to explore the campus and look for spots to study that no one can find. But unfortunately there are too many damn students in this place to accomplish that goal. This ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME is really nice. I think its the high ceilings that make me feel so comfortable in here. There are always open computers in here as well. Well my time is almost up. My experience in the psy class is very important to me considering I want to be a psychiatrist one day. 
__label__label0 I am in the library right now writing this stream of consciousness. I just had dinner. It was very delicious. I ate at the Kinsolving dormitory food center. The library is really quiet and I can hear the tying on the computer. People are walking in and out and it is a little bit distracting. I can't wait until this week is over. It will be Labor day weekend. I can't believe a holiday is just around the corner. It seems like just yesterday it was summer and I was having fun playing with my friends and hanging out. Over the Labor day weekend, I would love to go back home to LOCNAME and see my family, but I kind of would prefer to just stay here in LOCNAME. There is so much to do here and there is so much freedom. In a way it can be good but I really need to manage my time wisely. Today's psychology was really interesting. I loved the in class experiment that was done. It was pretty cool how the experiment worked especially since the first time was easy to tell when the girl was lying and the second time was really hard. I feel tired right now and I would like to go to sleep, but I know I should get this writing assignment out of the way. I was talking to my brother about computers today. It was fun but hard at the same time since it was over the phone. My mind went blank for a while and I can't think of anything to write. Tomorrow is one of my best friend's birthday. I can't believe she will be one year older. She is a senior in high school right now and I bet she is stressing over college applications like I was during senior year. I hope she gets everything done in time. I remember senior year was really interesting. I had to research a lot with colleges and what I wanted to do with my life especially choosing a major. So far, education is what I want to do. I think it will be fun especially if I decide to work with elementary students. I am feeling really sleepy right now and I can feel my fingers moving more slowly than before. I miss my family. Even though I am used to being away for a month. I know I will begin to miss them so much more in the next couple of months. I hope they are doing well and everything is working out in their lives. I also miss my friends back home especially my church family. I can't believe I am actually going to say this or actually type it but I also miss my pastor. Especially his sermons. As I am here in LOCNAME, I have been church hunting with some friends and the pastor's sermons here are just not the same. I guess I am really used to how he tried to make it apply to our daily lives and tried to really relate to us. Especially since I grew up in that church, I really miss all the good memories I have made there. I can't wait until the weather gets colder here in LOCNAME. I heard last year it snowed for a day in the morning. I really would like to see falling snow. I really love the cold weather and I like to play in the snow. Today's weather was nice. I could feel the cool breeze blowing in my face. There was less sun than usual. Maybe it is supposed to rain who knows. But I can definitely feel a weather change coming soon hopefully. I still can't believe that I am a freshman in college. I thought when I arrived here I would finally believe it but it is really hard to sink in. So far classes have been fun and a little boring at the same time. I try to think positively and try to learn something out of each time I spend in class. I am really worried about the tests and quizzes here at the university. I just don't know what to expect especially since different teachers do different things. I really hope that I will do well in the first semester of college in fact I hope to do well all the years I am in college. I think I've kind of forgotten how to study. After college applications were done and over with and after I knew where I was going to attend college, I kind of stopped studying really really hard for classes. I still studied but just not as hard and not as much as I should have. I feel like taking a shower and going to bed now. My eyes feel they are slowing shutting but I'm trying to keep awake. There are so many people here at the library. I knew there would be a lot of people but it's amazing to see how a lot of people use their time wisely and study and also take the time to do their homework even when there are so many temptations to go out and party. I suddenly feel itchy everywhere. I think a bug bit me. It is really annoying and itchy. This has been the most exciting assignment ever. It will be really weird to look back on what I wrote.       
__label__label0      I smell soy sauce in are hall some girl spilled it all over the place and now you can't be anywhere without smelling the nasty odor. Well I got back from a bible study got to see some people that I haven't seen in a while I suppose it made me feel at home and I actually made plans to hang out with someone I met this summer and haven't been able to see him that much. Anyways I enjoyed it but at the same time I wonder about my relationship with God I suppose it is a thought that always lingers in my mind. Is it strong enough to I pursue him enough am I a good person sometimes I don't know. so I'm listening while I do this music seems to be something that I have always enjoyed the way everything flows together and becomes something more than noise it seems that music in some forms is the perfection of the interpretation of emotions it not only puts words towards your feelings it gives the words syntax by adding in a conglermation of cacophonies that seem to support the words, Now even though some music doesn't appeal to me I believe that if anyone is writing the music backed by emotion and truth or feelings then they have earned my respect if that really means anything but to those who rock you have got my salutations. So lets get real I'm an 00 guy so I do also think about girls quite a bit. Today I thought of a girl in high school I missed and it is always an itching feeling or thought in the back of my head to try to commit to a girl or girlfriend. Even though I don't know what the hell I want to be honest, is that all this world is trying to please ourselves in order to feel worthy, who are we trying to impress. I don't know? but I can't deny my feeling I believe that truth lies in your emotions and that god gives you certain emotions that give you truth in your life. Sometimes I feel that the only thing we have here on this planet is love that's all we have that is really worth any value and if we give it away to others that is the only way to truly fulfill not only yourself but others, Live life love life. So as I continue to right I remind myself that love exist and to give it freely to those who are in my life. I find myself always observing people walking to class its amazing how afraid people are to look at each  other simple glances are rarely seen. what a society it would be if people simply acknowledged each other in life. So many lonely people. What do I like: the smell of rain, the sound of a harmonica and an acoustic guitar blending together like reunited twins, the smell of the mountains the feeling of seeing the sunrise and the gratefulness of seeing it set knowing that were alive and living I met an 00 year man this weekend he told me that life was to good and he didn't want it to end. I agree some people have forgotten that but I hope that one day the world will realize that being alive is the hope that we all have has long as are heart keeps beating there is something to do something to live for, someone to love, something to give, man being a kid was freaking awesome and I could play all day doing something as simply as climbing a tree or hide and seek and it was amazing. I wish I had a glass of milk before I went to bed but hey what can you do. Well there went 00 minutes I suppose I will go a little over to leave a quote from jerry PROPNAME "live life to the fullest and in death all you can be is grateful. " 
__label__label0      How much time do I have before I need to do some more homework. This week is going to be pretty busy. It is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out. All the teachers should use the same service. This would make it much easier for students to keep up. My goal is not to fall behind, but I have missed some classes of geology. I need to find out what I missed. That class is going to suck. I wish I had a car so that I could get places farther than a mile away. I hate writing. I hate typing. It is hard to write down everything you think. Our minds work 0 or 0 times faster than one can type or speak. So if we could talk faster, we could get up to 0 times the amount of information to someone else, leaving us with more free time. This would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating. I'm glad my spider bite went away. It sucked that I had to go to the health center for it. They gave me a shot in my ass. It left a bruise, but it didn't hurt until an hour or so later. It just sucked that it was on my face. It made me nervous when I heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because I had been putting it on for many days. Thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm. I spend much time alone now that I moved away. Luckily I enjoy being by myself. It is nice to have the peace and quiet. The parties are fun, it is just that I would prefer to chill with just my friends, not a million people that I don't know. I don't know too much about bull fighting, most other sports I have played. I do not see the glamour, passion, and joy of bullfighting. It seems barbaric to use ones instincts  
__label__label0 I'm actually really tired, but I want to finish as much homework as I possibly can. It's not terribly late so I thought it would be nice to write something on my thoughts right before I go to bed. Today was a good day. Not too much stress and I talked to a lot of my friends and family. Its always nice when I get to talk to old friends from hs. today I met a girl that went to the same elementary as me. we didn't know each other, but we had a connection because we were from the same town. MOst people have never heard of my town before, so it was pretty cool. I also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town, which again is strange. I actually met a lot of people, one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other. I'm glad to know that I have someone that I can study with or ask a question if I need help anytime I want. One good thing about college is that it's really easy to make friends. Even if you're a shy person, there's always someone who is willing to talk to you. I used to be really shy, but I don't have much of a problem introducing myself to random people, I actually enjoy doing that now. I look foward to those that I will meet tomorrow, I just hope I can remember everyone's name when I see them again. I've met so many people in such a short period of time that it becomes difficult to match names with faces. I enjoy all of my classes, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in my decision on what I plan to major in. It seems that I really do enjoy chemistry and biology, but I'm really glad to have a psychology class to take my mind off of things that I have to do. I'm really excited about Wednesday. I'm going to try out for the rowing team. I think I'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people. I hope I make the team, but I don't want to get my hopes up, so I'm just going to see how it goes. Today I went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and I feel much more comfortable with my decision. I was able to row correctly, although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement. but I was able to row for 0000 meters non-stop my first try, and I think that's pretty good because I only have to row for 000 meters for the tryouts. I'm not sure how good my chances are at making the team. I haven't been on a sports team since middle school. but I have been in band since sixth grade. band may not be the best workout ever or the most strenuous, but marching can get pretty tiring, and I think that it has prepared me a little for this. I'm really good with endurance which is key in rowing. In high school, we had to march for 0 minutes straight. my senior year I had a solo and I had to run around to my different sets and then stand still and play a long slow balad for a couple of minutes and make it musical. That was pretty hard to play without people realizing I'm completely out of breath. But it was really rewarding, I had the opportunity to play in front of thousands at a time at our football games. I could never get up in front of a crowd and speak or sing, but I can play my flute in front of anyone. I really wish I was able to be in the UT band. I had always wanted to be part of the band, but now my major doesn't allow the time. I hope that later in my college career, I have the chance to be in the marching band at least once. I think it would be so much fun. Music has always been a big thing in my life, I love to play it, but I also love to listen to it. My favorite kind of music is country. I especially love george strait. I have most of his cd's. I know every word to every song he sings, I only need to hear the first chord of one of his songs and I'll know its him. I'm also a big fan of 00's movies. one of my favorites is young frankenstein. mel brooks makes wonderful movies, I think they're all hilarious. real genius is another good one I like. most of my favorite movies I'm able to quote from beginning to end. one of the classics is the princess bride. there are so many great one-liners in that movie. my dad and I always say random quotes from movies anytime something happens. my dad knows the most trivial things. he'll know the answer to the most random question you can think of. its pointless, but its pretty cool. my dad and I are really close, I wish I could be more like my dad. we grew really close when my mom passed away when I was little, he remarried, and now I have a brother and a sister. I love my little sister so much, she's the cutest. she never uses my real name, she always calls me sister. I really miss her. but I talk to her often and she's always so excited to hear from me. she just got a new rabit, she's had 0 and three of them were sold in the stock show and one of them died. but now she has 0. I hope the heat doesn't get to these two like the others. she's always really worried about them. she also has a dog, and I have a dog named princess. my dog is a choc. lab. she's really cute, but she's also really old. I'm glad she has a new puppy to play with since I won't be there for her all the time. I've had her ever since I was little, I miss her too. I brought a lot of pictures and things from home so I wouldn't get homesick. my room is very comforting I think. I don't think I could stand it if it were blank. most of my pictures are of my family and of my best friend kelly. she goes to corpus with my brother, so she isn't that far away from me. we talk all the time online though, so it feels like she's here.      
__label__label1     Stream of Consciousness:  That time counter is very annoying, the videos that switched. a really good song just came on, I think it is by PROPNAME PROPNAME. This office smells kind of funny sometimes. I met this Girl named PROPNAME today and she is a runner for UT. I hope Parking and Transportstion appeals my ticket. I have some really random thoughts.  I want the best things out of life. But I fear that I want too much!  What if I fall flat on my face and don't amount to anything. But I feel like I was born to do BIG things on this earth. But who knows.  There is this Persian party today. My neck hurts. But I am excited about attending this party. The girl I like will be there. She is my ex. Btu it's all good. I hope she still has feeling for me. I woke up this morning with a terrible head ache.  I am wondering if I should invite my brother and hos friends to that party. I really wasn't invited myself, but I know PROPNAME will be there. I have some messages on my phone. How do you track feelings?  That must be hard to do. I feel good!  Healthy, kind of tired - but its morning time. I should call PROPNAME. I miss her. She is very cool. I hope no one actually wastes their time reading this. Because this stream of consciouness in BS. But it's ok. I guess I will learn something new from this class. I made a taks sheet for today. But I dought (is that how you spell that word?) I will finish everything on there. But I might. Life is much simpler when you have direction.  I need to get stated on my well logging  homework. I bet you guys don't even read this paper. I would be interested in seeing how people stucture this writing assignment. I mean, the way people form their paragraphs and stuff. As you can see I like writing paragraphs 0-0 sentences at a  time. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh, time is almost up. I am very glda to be done with is assignment. Thanks    
__label__label0 I'm thinking about bush and religion. I just had a simi arguement about it. I don't really care for the way the government is trying to impose religion on everyone. country music isn't that bad. I use to hate it in high school and now I've found a liking for it. tomorrow I go to nachadoches to visit friends. I'm looking forward to the driving and getting away from it all. I don't like being stuck down here. my room is really quiet. so is my roommate. we don't talk much. hopefully we'll open up and start to talk a bit. my legs itch and so does my back. I'm really full. that large pizza was really good. but the sight of pizza would make me really sick. I still can't stop thinking about government. it all just sickens me. I wish there were better canidates to choose from. face itches. I'm actually happy tonite. I got an A on my physics homework. ugh, physics was made by the devil, I swear. its like they don't want you to ever pass that class. leg itches. I'm a little stressed though. my shoulders and neck are all tight. I think its because of my whole financial aid deal. hopefully it will all be in by tomorrow so I can have some money for this weekend. arm itches. I really like country music. stomach itches. I miss old friends. maybe ill try to fix that this semester. get back in contact with old friends or try to stay in contact. I need to stop missing calculus class. its not like its hard. I just need to go and pay attention. I need to shave. I just need the time to do it. it takes forever. my chair is comfy. I don't like how my monitor is set-up. I wish I didn't have to turn my neck to look at the monitor. I wonder who is winning the patriots/colts game. I hope the colts win. I don't want to see the pats win anymore. I really like the underdogs, except when its UT playing. got to support the home team. astros finally lost a game. 00 straight and then a lose. hope they won the second game of the doubleheader. now I see why I people don't like country music, it puts you in a more mellow mood. not sad but not happy. more of a reflective mood. man, this summer was awesome. I can't wait til next summer. college intern at cypress united methodist. 000 kids, wow! a girl from katy died today. some people from the mission trip knew her. its so sad to be taken at such a young age. texas better beat arkansas Saturday. ill be pissed if they lose again to them. I itch a lot. my beard especially. that's why I need to shave it. ugh, 0am class tomorrow. I thought freshman year was going to be the only year I had them. oh well, the class is easy and entertaining. I can't wait for this to be over. I really wish me and my roommate would talk more. it gets kind of akward in here when we are just sitting at our computers not talking to each other. I need to excercise. I'm feeling lazy. I want to play raquetball. it was great when I hit ash in the head with the ball and then when I fell on my butt when trying to serve. great times. my beard still itches. I think I'm going to go shave soon. its driving me nuts. this is a lot like writing in a journal. just a lot more random. but being random is fun, it throws people off.      
__label__label0      I'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because I attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 00:00. very ironic. I feel very tired right now and really unmotivated. I have a lot to do and I don't feel like doing anything. I wish I could just go to sleep. I need a lot of attention from people these days and I'm just not getting it. matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it. seems very convinient of him but whatever. he is acting weird, and different but he doesn't know or doesn't see what he's doing. it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and I'm slowly beginning to not care. but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school, sleep, and me then to the things that he is focusing on. maybe I'm just overreacting though, because I seem to do that so well. I don't feel like being here, my head hurts, and I smell burnt popcorn in the hall way. I have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 0. I don't know what the day will have in store for me, hopefully I will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that's bothering me. I need to realize that I can make myself happy and I don't need someone else to make me happy. I don't even know why I'm rambling on about this, its just always in my head I suppose. I hope I get a new car. my dad said I can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance. but who knows what kind of car he's going to get me. It will probably be something crappy like I have now. but I can't complain, something is definatly better than nothing, at least in this case. my economics book came in today. finally, becasue I was starting to stress that I was going to get too far behind. I really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything. even though I do try but I need more. I need to focus on doing that for all of my classes. but economics and chemistry are the main ones that I might have difficulty in. just because they are very mathy subjects. I might stay at the appartment tonight but I probably won't because I have such an early class tomorrow. well see what happens I suppose. I think matts court started already and he didn't even call me to let me know that he got to town safely. oh well, like I said I'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things. that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all, about anything. it feels bad to feel like you're on the back burner, or that things have changed, though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change. I'm so tired right now I could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow. but I can't do that because I have entirely too much work to do. tonight I want to get caught up with my psychology eradings, and I want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two. my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake. I hope all of that works out ok. if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but I'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does. I'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt. I don't know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me. I just hope it counts to him. oh well. I met with my mentor group earlier. they're all really nice people and I hope I get to know them a lot better as the year progresses. its a pretty fun experience. this weekend should be fun. I'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san PROPNAME and go see some people that I haven't seen in a long time. I hope I can scrounge up something to wear, because I need to do laundry and I need to go shopping,  I have like no clothes anymore, I don't know what happened. my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if I see her this weekend. I hinestly don't feel like going home though. it gets too awkward for me. I don't know what but I don't really like it. I'd rather just stay here and study or like watch TV then go home and feel awkward with my family. I have so much to do and I'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun. I can already see that college is going to be very hectic. I hope I can handle it alright. wow the time is up. 
__label__label1 I didn't sleep at all last night and I'm barely making it through my day. I feel like a zombie, but hey what's new?  I have an english paper due on Monday. I think I completely bombed the thesis. I guess I can always go back and change it. I'm tired, I can't think. that's a lie, of course I can. it will simply be rambling nonsensical jumble. and that counts too right? sure it does. I've been seeing this guy. he's about seven years older than I am, and that shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it's more of an age difference than anyone I've dated before. I can meet him on an itellectual level, conversation isn't lacking, there's physical attraction and the whole deal. so why am I so doubtful? I suppose because I'm paranoid about becoming an obnoxious needy stereotypical girl. Unfortunately I have been that to others in the past and refuse to ever play that part again. I'm so much stronger now, more confident and comfortable with myself as a person. Anyway, my point is I'm scared to let him know I'm sincerely intersted because I think it will freak him out and send him running in the other direction. I can make my intentions known without actually verbalizing my feelings. And I'm pretty sure at this time in the relationship- whatever time it might be- is too soon to bring up any of those concerns. Is he seeing anyone else? Does he care? Does he not want to hurt my feelings so he won't tell me he doesn't want to hang out? it's so ridiculous to hear myself think like this. basically I'm so afraid of rejection that I'm willing to do it myself, before anyone really gets the chance. I've dated a plethera of losers over the past year and I'm tired of not caring about anyone. anyone in that way I guess. yes I have friends and have plenty to do without a guy to entertain (that sounds really harsh- it is me that wants this. )but I miss that connection. I want to be in love again. but who doesn't? I suppose once I stop wanting it I'll find it. that's the way of the world sometimes. yeah but about him. it is what it is and if it doesn't work out than so be it. plenty of fish in the sea and all that. but he does have some potential. enough of this. it's making my head hurt. I don't like that my stream of consciousness has turned into more of a "dear diary" than anything else. I'm sitting in the student microcomputer facility among my fellow longhorns at the moment. I wonder how many of them are doing this assignment right now. maybe none. everyone's in their own little worlds. deep inside their thoughts or their research. everyone seems so disconnectced, though I suppose that's the point of this place. a quiet area to get work done, not social hour. I'm about to go to ecology evolution and society. I've been reading the assigned chapters, but I fear that I'm not actually retaining any of the information. I guess it will become quite apparent when I get my first test scores back. all I want to do here is to do well. it's the only reason I'm living in austin again, to continue my education. so that's what I aim to do. make the most out of the billion things I have to accomplish today. cross them off my list and get them out of the way in order to make room for all the new. life is pretty enjoyable when you don't let it drag you down with the minor negative aspects. so many people do that. drown in their own self pity and reamin miserable regardless. just smile sometimes, it really can make you feel better, and probably someone else as well. that's what I think, but this mind of mine is all over the place and never seems to rest. the end. my time is up.                            
__label__label0      oh boy, the first writing assignment. I hope I am doing this correctly. I can't really think of anything else right now. I sort of have a slight headache. todays speech class was very boring. I am still bored because of it. sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored. what else can I say. I am still bored because of it. my mind is still a blank. I don't know what I feel. my apt is sort of warm right now, so I guess its a little warm in here. I can hear my computer buzzing above everything else. I guess that can start to get annoying after a while. oh man, its only been two minutes thus far. 00 min of writing sure will suck. well, I still don't know what to think. I'm still bored. I'm now starting to think about a friend of mine. a special friend, who's company I enjoy very much. she lives back home in houston, and I occasionally see her on the weekends, although I've been talking to her online quite a bit lately. she is definetly someone special. now I'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly. although this guy is a friend of my roommates, he is also a friend of mine, but through our mutual friend. he's always over, always. this guy can get annoying, and when ever he comes over, he just annoys us. I'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now. now my mind has drifted to ice cream. we all had ice cream last night. it was good stuff, but I think I had a little too much. we went to cold stone creamary on the drag. now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer. its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream. that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now. now my mind has drifted to my dad, who paid for that ice cream when I when I bought it using his credit card account. I guess I thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home. now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago, but I ignored his call because I am doing this writing assignment. this guy is a cool guy, I like him. he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio. his girlfriend goes here to ut. he's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate. now my mind has shifted to a looser guy I know that my friend from san antonio doesn't like. this other guy also goes to school in san antonio. these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago, and although I'm a passivist, I hope my friend and this other guy duke it out, for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons. I thought it was funny seeing the two argue, and almost fight. although if the two were to fight, I think my friend would beat his ass. now thinking of san antonio, my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio. some of these guys went to high school with me as well, some didn't. I wonder how they're doing. its been a while since I last talked to almost any of them, and I just wonder how they're doing. maybe I should go up there sometime. although I have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now. oh boy, another  seven minutes to go. damn that's a long time. I'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio. now I'm thinking about a friend that went to ut, from san antonio, who unfortunetely flunked out of ut. I think his parents weren't too happy about it, because I've heard they've enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by. now another friend called me, but I ignored his call as well. now I'm thinking about my friend who just called me. this guy I've know for almost 00 or 00 years, quite possibly one of my earliest friends. he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged. I'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time. happy because he'll be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling. yet sad becuase I know things will be different once he's married. for example, he won't be able to hang out quite as much, although I'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then. and also becuase he'll have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably won't feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer, or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days. what ever the future holds for him, I know he'll be happy, and for that reason, I too am happy, for him that is. well, its about another two minutes to go, I hope that this will end soon. and now I see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and I, which I don't thin she should do. I think I'll stop her when I'm done wtih this assignment. another couple of seconds to go till I'm done. yippie. 
__label__label0  Hi. My nPROPNAMEe is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. Usually when PROPNAME have to write something I like to introduce myself first. I did not prewrite this I promise. I was born November 00, 0000 (PROPNAME day before Thanksgiving). I am now 00 years old and am excited about being in the college ORGNAME engineering ORGNAME the ORGNAME PROPNAME ORGNAME at ORGNAME as a Biomedical engineering major. I love to play sports (volleyball, softball, and track), write poetry, praise dance! and enjoy nature. Some things that I would like to do before I leave LOCNAME or before I graduate college are to go horseback riding again (preferably, to take horseback riding lessons), to go kyacking ( I don't have a clue right now as to how to spell this word), to go parasailing with a friend of mine and to visit the capitol and some of the musuems in the city. I would also like to get involved in a good service organization. I love service and helping other people. Oh!  About my family. I am the PROPNAME of PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME of LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. I have one older sister, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. My father works for a nuclear plant, my mother is a teachers aide, and my sister is in the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. She (my sister) has been overseas twice (yes, to LOCNAME as well--she said that where she was wasn't that bad at all). She has now been restationed to florida. This makes me really nervous sometimes because we are predicted to have a pretty bad hurricane season this year and many of them hit florida. She picked a bad state to go to. Anyway, I told my sister that she could go wherever she wanted as long as I could come and visit at least once (ha! Like I could really decide where she would go. I just thought I'd try it). She would have flown me to LOCNAME to go see the sites and to go see the pyramids in LOCNAME but my mom wouldn't let me go. She didn't want the both of us over there. However, I plan to go visit in LOCNAME either during Christmas break or Spring Break. My thoughts have now shifted to the PROPNAME family. This is a family or couple that I meet on a plane my eighth grade summer. I had gone to National Baptist Conference in LOCNAME and was flying back to houston by myself. They told my god-mother, who was with me before the flight, that they would keep an eye on me. When we got to houston we exchanged info and said we would keep in touch. Now, usually when this happens, people don't really keep in touch but in this case we have kept in touch for over 0 years now. We send each other cards, call each other and all that good stuff. I think that that is just amazing. What esle to talk about???? OK I am just getting words now. (Friends, other homework, love,Oh) Let me tell you about the home I would like. I was raised in a somewhat country area and I came seem to get awat from that. I would like to build a big country house with a large bay area window, sunlight roof in the kitchen or some area of the house, maybe a lake, and I know that I want horses, dogs, and cats. I don't know why but this picture always comes into my head when I think of what I want my future home to look like. Also I have to have a porch that goes all the way around with at least one swing on it and most definitely atleast one walk in closet. I don't know exactly where I would like this house but I think I would like it to be somewhere in LOCNAME. Time is almost up and this is about all that I can think of right now anyway so bye and I will see you next time. The one and only.   
__label__label0 it is a beautiful day outside and I hope to enjoy it as best I should I am listening to one of my favorite bands. this song matches my mood perfectly. I feel like I should be doing something with my life and I'm not, and it's very har to get along in this university without feeling lonely now and then. I find beauty in very conventionally ugly things and this is why I love photography so much. the pictures I have up on my walls reflect my personality a lot. there are so many aspects of me that people never get to see and it hurts when they judge without knowing me personally. I see in color in the sense that I see the most vibrancy and brightness in everything. my room here is finally starting to smell lik ehome and that's one of the first things I notice when I come in. I'm glad I ended up at ut. I thought I was kind of chickening out by coming here. it's the only place I applied to. I'm a freshman this year and I really hope to get out in 0 years, since I have 00 hours of credit from exams. I hope I can get out in 0 years because I want to feel good about myself and not feel inferior to my peers. I have a lot of issues about who I am and that's why psychology fascinates me so. I understand a lot of who I am more than most people my age. I'm feeling very wise right now and although my boyfriend is a year older than me, I sometimes feel years older than him. I might want to marry him someday and I worry about that. I miss the way things were 0 years ago when I was carefree I feel very burdened and I sometimes think I'm not experiencing college because I feel that way so often. I've always had so much to do that when I don't, I can't relax and I get really anxious. if I'm not stressed out I think I'm missing something. when I watched president PROPNAME speak last night I cried because I'm so worried that he will be reelected. I am an avid kerry fan and feel passionately about politics and when I hear bush lie and make empty promises and see people believe what he's saying it affects me deeply. I want to make a difference in the world someday. I hope I will grow to be someone great. my past relationships have been sneaking up on me recently an d things on that front are disturbing an dmaking me feel regretful. I there are some things that I remember so perfectly about the past and I don't know why they stick out. I know that there is something special inside me and I hope I can do something great in this world. I remember going to europe two years ago and feeling so happy with myself and who I was and I don't have any clue about that anymore. I find peace in knowledge. wondering stresses me out. I used to write a lot of poetry and I still feel just as expressive but now the words don't flow as well. I think that as I've grow up, my poetic naivete has faded as has any talent I had. I feel bery inferior to people that don't know me they look at me like I have no self worth and it bothers me. I am a government major and a psych minor but some people think because I'm in liberal arts I have no direction in my life and that is so frustrating. it frustrates me when people think I am stupid. I have almost no tolerance for ignorance yet I get mad when people do that. I am very analytical, mayb eoveranalytical, and its gotten me into a lot of trouble in my life I miss conor and what we had a few years ago and I miss our friendship I need to feel safe and comforted in order to be successful and I am very dependent on other people in my life to do that for me. when we weren't 000 miles apart I miss justin in many ways and that bothers me he was the most detrimental person in my life and still is so far and last night I was thinking about those three days that were the worst in my life and there is only 0 thing I can do to get past that. I don't know if I will ever. one of my main goals in life is to be understood and I feel very misunderstood by people that don't take the time to get to know me and I feel that the first impressions I give are not very accurate. I am very emotional and I know that just thinking about certain things will make me burst into tears it makes me feel inferior to do that. I feel guilty when I cry because things could be a lot worse. I want this world to improve and I want to help it do so. I need a lot of love. ramon and I have something really special he makes me feel so loved we have been together for two whole years and I want to be with him forever I want to make him happy and I want him to make me happy until we are old and I want to share everything I have with him. I wasn't sure about that until recently but now I feel more passionately about our relationship than I ever have. sometimes I cry out of neither sadness nor happiness and its hard to explain to anyone else it feels like I cry out of understanding a complex emotion that I never was able to before. if a song really touches me and I connect to it I will almost definitely cry. I think that makes me special. I think I am more compassionate than most people. music is one of the most powerful mediums of communication there is it makes me feel freer than anything else except possibly writing. the sound of this song is so familiar and it reminds me of good memories  
__label__label1 so yeah. I finally get to the point where I feel like I have some sanity in my life, and back he comes. why did I let him back into my life?  I went out last weekend and had the weekend from hell. first the fire alarm, then the game (not too bad), then the car accident (thank God none of us were involved), and finally the other two ambulances in front of Halcyon. why can't just go get a damn cup of tea without the world come crashing down on me (improper grammar, I kmow. so is the punctuation for that matter). so anyway, back to jason. the bane of my existence and the one thing I cannot escape. last night I decide to try an dangerous tactic and back him into a corner just to see what he'd do. (probably should have left that up to the professionals - namely advisor jes who did it with me to get me to pick a concentration, classics or middle east. )  found out it doesn't work as well with relationships - esp. with a guy who has taken over a year to make up his mind and still hasn't really decided anything. talk about making me feel completely worthless. so I say, "you're still a kid. "  "I know. "  "so grow up, jason. be a man. make a goddamn decision. "  "I can't be with you. "  why does he always run?  my brother did the same thing. what is it about men that when faced with fight of flight emotionally, they ALWAYS run?  so unwittingly I cornered myself as well. I realized I can't let this man go, no matter how bad he is for me. I will continually put myself at his mercy, despite the fact that HE was the one who left me this summer. why do I make it so easy for him to come back. is a little bit of fear a healthy thing?  he's not afraid to lose me at all!  because he KNOWS that I'll never go anywhere. too bad the fool didn't KNOW that I loved him as much as I did. now how do I get that back?  I was crying on the windowsill. just one more part of the apartment to be initiated into my life with tears. I was hoping the sill would have been initiated in other ways. he promised to come visit me. this coming weekend was shot to hell thanks to ET. second time that bastard has screwed up my life. so I make him promise me the weekend after. only thing is that I had plans to celebrate my birthday with my friends that weekend. football game + club = fun night. now he's coming, hopefully. but yet more plans put aside for him. he would say, "but I never asked you to do that," or, "you're the one that wants me to come. "  why doesn't he get that I hate living like this, and it's HIS torture that makes me have to put my life aside?  so now what do I do?  I call him all day, playing phone tag, hating the hell I'm in. but I keep my composure. if anything I've learned in this last year of hell it's how to keep my composure. not enitirely sure what good that does me. damn this keyboard is spongy. wish it had that new full size one that has flat keys like a laptop. should make it much easier on the ORGNAME. so what was I thinking?  oh yeah, phone tag. I finally get to talk to him while I'm in the bathroom (wow does that gross him out) and I ask him if we can just pretend last night didn't happen. and he tells me I'm paranoid. fool, you told me you couln't be with me and I'm not supposed to be paranoid?  WTF?!  geez, I write a lot in 00 mins. this picture above the computer in the lab is. interesting, not really pretty. poor taste in art these people. so then he starts falling asleep, as ususal, and the conversation dies. and each time I try to resurrect the thing to achieve some sort of closure, I feel like part of me dies too. how many buckets my tears would fill over this past year I could not count. I'm so tired of crying. it's frightening that sometimes it's the only thing that makes anything better. and even more scary that I cry just to get a response out of him because he DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING!!!  the silence is pure torture and he must know it. but nothing ever changes. do I sound like I have abused spouse syndrome?  emotionally abused. tortured. dead. I wonder what these girls would think if they read over my shoulder. what would sameera say/do if she knew I was putting myself through hell again for this man?  time almost up. thanks for the opportunity for the release. 0 0 0 0 0 done. 
__label__label0      The speakers that are connected to my computer are extremely cheap. I only purchased them because there was a $00 mail-in rebate with them. It would be really nice to have a new computer, this one is old and outdated and the internet connection is really slow. I am tired of always having to listen to my brother and his girlfriend bicker and yell at each other, they are like two little kids every waking hour I'm with them they are constantly harassing each other. My computer monitor is really small. It makes looking at my screen for extended periods of time like this hurt my eyes. College life is really not what I expected. I'm constantly feeling homesick and want to go back to LOCNAME. I guess I just need to get acclimated to PROPNAME and college life once I do I'm sure I will enjoy it very much but until then I will attempt to go back to LOCNAME as much as possible. Luckily a lot of my friends also attend UT, they are definitely making the transition more bearable. Every one of my classes has over 000 people in them. This is a big change from my 00 people honors classes in high school. It doesn't really allow me to make relationships with my professors. PROPNAME was really fun. I ran smack into the wall with my shoulder and it still hurts but its a good pain one of those pains that reminds you that you accomplished something fun and physically strenuous. Yeah I don't think I spelled that word correctly. I'll have to look it up in the dictionary when I am done. Is this assignment done yet? No still 00 and a half minutes to go. This is the first time I've ever written a stream of consciousness. I know there is some famous novel or documentary our there where there is like a 00 page stream of consciousness containing only a single sentence. I think its title has the world Ullyses or it is written by a Ullyses or something. I know this because my father appraised me of it. Just useless trivia I guess. I enjoy watching trivia games on TV, mainly stuff like Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Jeopardy. But maybe that's just because normally there isn't anything else on. The World Series of Poker is enjoyable to watch as well. I was initially really sceptical about writing this stream of consciousness because I didn't really know how it would turn out or how easy it would be to write, but now that I'm half way through it things are just sort appearing on the page. Definitely not what I expected. I have to say this is the most interesting writing assignment I think I have ever had. Whew only 0 minutes to go. The printer next to me is running out of ink, which means it will have to be replaced pretty soon which means more money out of my pocket. You have to be thrifty in college that's for sure. My budget is $000 a month and this month alone I have already spent over 000. I sure am glad that I received financial aid to make the burden of paying for college easier on my parents. They were sure proud of me when I told them about the scholarships I received. It felt good to make them proud. My brother is smart and does extremely well in school, I hope I can live up to my parents standards and continue to do well educationally in college. College sure is much different from high school. A lot more studying and my studying skills aren't nearly up to par considering I almost never did it high school. Now I know I need to study to do well in school so I am, but it just takes me forever to outline a chapter. A lot longer than it seems like it really should. I guess maybe I'm a little bit too stressed out about college. I'm sure that once I get used to it, it will be one of the best experiences of my life. But until then, it's still hell. My friends are in the living room, I told them before I started writing this not to disturb me for 00 minutes, but who knows if they will obey me. My one friend PROPNAME loves to just barge into my room. I played raquetball with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I suck at raquetball but hey it's only my 0rd or 0th time to play it. None of us are really are that good. The lie detector test in Psychology class last time was cool. My hands normally get really sweaty so I'm sure I would have sent that sweat-o-meter off the charts, I wonder why my hands are sweaty a lot. 
__label__label0      Yaaaaay. I'm doing psychology things. I'm really tired. And I wish I didn't' have to study so that I could go to sleep. I also wish I could type faster. I'm glad I'm here. Because being almost anywhere is better than being in LOCNAME. Except for being in LOCNAME. LOCNAME is all concrete and construction. But ORGNAME has squirrels. And lots of them. . What am I going to say in the whole 00 mins. I have to say anything I want? . Will people actually read this?. I guess I don't care if they do. Because I'm the type of person that thinks it's pointless to write for my own enjoyment. I get enjoyment out of other people reading what I write and then them enjoying it. . Hmm. I miss my boyfriend. Even tho he made me ANGRY last nite. He's still a nice and good boyfriend. On another totally random note. I've got this pimple on my face. Hahaha. It hurts! And it bothers me too! I want it to disappear! Not that it makes me look bad. I actually think it makes me look somewhat cute! hahah. That's kind of weird. Oh well. I wish I had a memory card for my playstation so I can finish Final Fantasy 0. At this rate. It'll take me YEARS to finish it. But maybe this is for the better. So I can study instead of play, because I would definitely be playing that and Metal Gear Solid. But. Only on weekends. Hahaha. I'm a girl that plays video games. I'm weeeeeiiiiiirrrrd. I wonder if I can get that job at the LanCave. I would be EVER SO HAAAAAPPPYYY. That would be awesome. It doesn't seem hard at all. just like the same stuff I did at eb but instead of renting people games I sold it to them. I don't miss eb at all. I wonder if PROPNAME left yet. That place is the devil. And video games are the spawn of the devil. . I wonder what PROPNAME is doing over at UofH. I hope he's having fun and he's not regretting his decision to go to UofH instead of LOCNAME. yah. We used to be big ORGNAME heads. Then he changed his mind and I changed my mind. And then I changed my mind again. And the I changed my mind back again to UT and now here I am. Woot woot go me. I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome. I hope there's free therapy after this writing exercise. blaaaaaaah. I haven't met very many people that are into stuff that I'm into. Except for PROPNAME. I can't wait to meet some other dorky kids that are into videogames and Japanese and cute fashion stuff. I want to go to ORGNAME ORGNAME on Friday. But I will be going all alone because I"m sure that PROPNAME will not come with me. But PROPNAME might! I totally forgot. I will call and ask her. But that means that I have to give up Wushu practice. Maaan. I have such big dreams. But I have no idea which ones to follow. That gets frustrating. Okay. If I decide to give up Wushu. Then maybe I can get into fencing. or maybe even Kendo. But wushu is so neeeeaaat! but I don't know if I even have the strength to do it. it's crazy. maybe I should not do and just try again next year. No hard feelings, I hope. I don't even know if I'll have money to pay for that. I hope I get ANY job on campus. I'm. just. Bleh. I hope I get to stop being so anti-social. I'm not really anti-social. just a bit shy and cautious about who I talk to. I think that's a good thing. However, it can be very lonely. My wrists hurt. I wonder if my brother is having fun at home. probably not. Lol. He never seems to be having fun when he's alone. Aww. Now I feel bad for leaving him. Maybe he'll be encouraged to invite his friends over to hang out or something. I don't want him to be all lonely like I was as a junior in high school. . I wonder if my older brother has decided to go to graduate school yet. Or if he's really thinking about that invention thing. Heh. At least he's got his major and he's doing it in 0 YEARS. go him. He's my hero. Hahaha. I'm glad he kind of knows what he wants to do, because I sure don't. I'm torn between wanting something that will be lucrative and people will really need, and doing something that I looooove to do with all my heart. I've found, thru various high school experiences and the first year long relationship, that I can learn to love almost anything. which is a bad thing. I have no idea what I'm really good at and have no idea exactly how to find out. I already feel like I'm running out of time right now as I sit here typing out a required assignment. It's crazy. And frustrating. And I don't' want to try to do too many things at once, because that is what caused my uber-dramatic downfall my senior year. Okay. Maybe it wasn't a downfall. But it did make me realize some stuff about being human that you would think I'd know already, having been a human for almost 00 years. Silly me. Oh well. It won't happen again here, because I'm not in LOCNAME and I'm away from people that drag me down. I can choose who to interact with most times here, so that puts me in a position of power I rarely have. PROPNAME for college. very glad I'm here and not in LOCNAME. 
__label__label0      I'm home. wanted to go to bed but remembered that I had a psychology homework to complete by sometime during next week. Maybe this wouldn't take that long. I can handle this. Something is making a noise in the restroom. Did I turn on the fan? I got to write more. This is harder than I thought. I'm not thinking anything. Was I always like this when I didn't have anything to do? Should I go to bed after finishing this assignment or should I stay awake. I think I had an appointment with someone. Or maybe it was some kind of meeting, that was not mandatory to participate in. Is there any assignments besides this. My roommate took my digital camera yesterday, but it's right beside me, now. Wonder what he did with it. I'll ask him when he comes back. My eyes hurt. I should really do something about my glasses. When should I go fix it. ? Feel tired. I should really go to bed. Only 0 minutes passed. Half way done. Wonder if I can just stop here. Maybe not. Hm. let's see. What am I thinking? Wow my feet are covered with dirt. Amazing I didn't notice that until now. How did I get this on my legs? I want to wash it off but I'll wait until this assignment is over. 0 minutes to go. What are my parents doing anyway? Hope they're doing fine. When would they be able to receive the email I sent few minutes ago. Anyways, I feel like I really had to finish something today but can't remember what it was. Guess I'll figure it out after taking a nap. Am I still not there. Never knew how long a 00 minute could be. Thirsty. No water around. Now I'm curious what the purpose of this assignment is and what kind of point professor is trying to make. Time is almost up. 
__label__label0 I have just gotten off the phone with brady. I'm trying to decide what exacly we will do  this weekend. he wants to go to a hotel, but I know I have to babysit and I'm not sure exactly  how I will tell my dad to pick us up from here. My birthday is this weekend, and it doesn't really  even feel like it. I don't really mind, but I have a feeling PROPNAME probably won't do much for it. I  almost feel like I'm always doing something for him. I should, I really care about him. He says  he will pay for the hotel, but I don't really want that for my birthday. I'ts just not htat important  to me. I feel guilty today for lying to my dad about gettin gout of the TIP program. I know that  sometimes I have to lie about things like that in order for them to understand. I haven't heard  from my mom so I'm not sure if she's mad at me or not. She probably doesn't care, but when  she does find out she will freak. I wish PROPNAME would pay more attention. He tries so hard, but it  doesn't seem like he has the chance to do so. I need to work out. I'm feeling that although I  don't weigh that much my weight is getting out of control. Perhaps I'm overreacting. PROPNAME  and I went shopping yesterday. I really don't plan on shopping anymore. Yikes. We don't really  need anything anyways. I need a strapless bra though. I'm surprised I didn't get one. oh well. I wish I could figure out what to do on Friday with PROPNAME. I want PROPNAME to be able to hang out  with us too. He's concerned that I tell her too mucha bout our personal life, but I really don't. PROPNAME kind of pisses me off. Why is everyone so negative about a caring relationship?  She's  probably just jealous, she hasn't been able to keep a guy at all for a long time. I'm concerned  for her because I don't want her to be doing drugs anymore, but she probably is. She has too much  sex too. lol. It's hard to not be concerned with what your friends are doing. PROPNAME is  surprisingly very understanding to everything that's going on in my life. She's caring and funny  to be around. I wasn't sure what to expect since she's friends with PROPNAME, PROPNAME etc. They  apparently aren't waht I expected them to be. They play if off to be all God-like, when in all  realtiy they judge pretty much everyone. I don't think that is right. Although I'm not that  religious, I do care about God and don't think that those kinds of behavior are fair. I'm looking  att he picture of PROPNAME and me. PROPNAME was kind of weird about the whole boyfriend thing. I hope  that brady and I last. I would do anything to spend the rest of my life with him. I care about  him so much, and the distance hurts. I think it isi probably for the best though. I can't imagine  having to go to school with him. His roommates aren't as crazy as I thought, but bad enough. I  jut hope that he doesn't get heavy into drinking,a nd I don't assume he will. PROPNAME is a bitch, I  can't believe she comes off like taht. ugh, it really bothers me. I wonder what it's like at home  without me there. My mom is making a big deal about me not calling, but in all honesty I just  don't care. I don't know why I'm so unfeeling lately. It's probably because I'm about to start my  period. maybe I'll skip it this month, in fact I probably will. I don't usually have allergies, but for  some reason my eyes keep tearing. It's either my contacts or allergies. I just changed my  contacts though. I really have to pee. The eyes watering is a little embarrassing. Sometimes I  wish I coiuld do more. I kind of wish I woul dhave rushed to be in a sorority. I feel as though I  ahve no friends because I have lost them to brady. Should I go to florida with my parents during  spring break or should I spend time with PROPNAME instead?  Maybe I could make money  babysitting. That would be nice. I hope my parents aren't mad because I want to babysit on  Saturday instead ofdoing my birthday thing. I don't see why it would be that big of a deal, but  apparently it is. I kind of want to go tanning, but it's not good with my current skin situation and  whatnot. that reminds me of richard rush. I wonder how he is doing. Spoiled brat. I'm really  hungry too. I'm not sure what I'm going to eat, but I wish PROPNAME would get here so taht we can  go eat. That would be really good. lol. I'm hoping that I won't look old when I'm 00 or so. Heck, I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I almost feel as though if I marry PROPNAME  will accomplish everything. I want so badly to be with him forever. NO one understand me like  he does. I wish I had saved myself for him, like he did for me. How is he able to only commit  to me?  I must care about him so much that he feels like he should. I'm glad that I've gotten to  know hhis family a lot better. his mom is honestly really nice to me, and I don't ahve a problem  with her anymore. It would be awesome to be ilke paris hilton. She's has it really good. I  wonder what it would be like if my parents lived more like they should. They are always trying  to save money when in reality being multi-millionaires does not mean that you should only do  that. Perhaps it's a shock from the inheritance or something. I don't know. It's confusing to  me. Ok, this is getting old. I'm a little tired of writing. It's probably because I'm hungry. I'm a little  confused as to what I should study here at school. I've had an interst in psychology, but do I  really want to do that for the rest of my life. I know it doesn't just end here, but I feel as though  there aren't many options when it comes to what I can do with my life. yay, kristen got back and  we can go eat now. My time is almost over. I'm about to pee in my pants too. AHHHHH!!!!! some people try to hard 
__label__label0 I can't believe that I missed my first class this morning. I don't know what happened. Maybe my roommate turned off my alarm early PROPNAME didn't tell me. But I don't think so, because he's a good guy and he wouldn't do that. I hope there wasn't a quiz in kinesiology today. That would just be my luck. The one time I miss it, there was a quiz. Man this sucks not having books, I'm getting so far behind in all my classes reading. It's going to be hard to catch up. There are some many people in all my classes it's ridiculous. You know what else is ridiculous, not having books. Why can't I get into shape faster?  I know it takes time, but I've been running for 0 weeks and I don't see  much of an improvement. If I am going to walk on the cross country team here I need to be faster than I was in high school. My old high school team mates are not doing so hot right now. The top runners are running about one minute and a half behind what we were running last year. I was running 00:00 for a 0K, but these guys are running like 00:00 for a 0K. They are going to have a lot of time to make up if they are going to be competitive in one of the toughest districts in the state, second to only the woodlands district. God, I hate the woodlands, and cedar park, and LOCNAME. I wish I hadn't injured myself during track season, cause I had to take 0 months off the heal. And three months with no running killed me. I gained like 00 pounds during the summer session here at LOCNAME. But summer school was so much fun. I met lots of cool guys like PROPNAME, rahim, and PROPNAME. And a lot of girls. Actually too many girls to count, but out of all those girls, I don't think any of them found me attractive at all. And when ever some girl approaches me at a party, some one will swoop in take her. Some one like PROPNAME or rahim. I'm still mad for what PROPNAME did. I can't believe that he "made out" with my best friend and the girl that I love so much. That just sucked. I felt like some one had ripped out my heart and then run it over with several big rigs, then dropped it off a high building, then feed it to piranhas in the LOCNAME rain forest. But I know PROPNAME didn't do that one purpose, or did he?  But I had a long talk with both PROPNAME and PROPNAME, and we're cool. Oh and PROPNAME is coming to visit this weekend!  I am so excited! I haven't seen her since before school started like 0 weeks ago. I'm disappointed because she was supposed to come to ORGNAME but she didn't get into articture school so she had to go to atm, but she is going to transfer her in a year. I hope. I have to plan a fun weekend with stuff for us to do, so she and I can have a good time again. But what do I do?  I have to work part of sat and sun, but we still can have fun Friday and then after I get off work. I just want her to be happy, if its not with me then so be it. But I will marry her, I will marry her, because I love her so much and she is my best friend. I hope she feels the same way. I don't know what to do, cause I don't want to mess up our perfect friendship, oh well. We will have to see what unfolds. 
__label__label0 This is what I need to do. Type with my friends in the messenger its really ADDICTING. LMaoOO. Well I love to listen to music. Its really soothing for me and I fell weird with out it. I LOVE TUTY ORGNAME BRazeros Musical( ; ; my favorite group) I wonder when they are going to come back. (this there one of there songs. Lloviendo esta y atra vez de la lluvia te llevas con tigo a la cuidad entera mis lagrimas no miras la lluvia las confuendedn y aunque yo este llorando por mi no te preocupes. Te esperare te esperare aunque no vuelas mas. Llenaste mi rtecuerdos a la cuidad entera. Y aunque yo se que nunca mas tu volveras. " Lagrimas y Llubia by Brazeros Musical. Who did I get backstage. It was all a rush. But am glas I did. I meet one of my favorite groups. They were nice. There performance was great. Although at the end they stinked musty and were all sweaty they were forth it. PROPNAME and PROPNAME were the cutest of them all. I was surprised that PROPNAME recognized me. there is nothing special about me and well. He was remembered how my face looked like. I Hate this song put I cannot tell my roommate its from the 00s or something like that its OLD. "In the car wash. " maybe because I heard it for too long. Its a remix. Its lonely in my room. I have nothing to do but be here in the computer. Reflecting back on high school it was exciting but I wish we could've done better things to make it wonderful and more unforgettable. I Made it to PROM Court. I was Beaten by a girl That never attended school. How can all these people that don't go to school ever always pass and get better things then me and my friends. We were all great students. And never broke the rules!!! Its beb 00 mins and well I have a million things tuning through my head. I miss my family (as whole) because they went to MEXICO with out me. This the first year they do it and I feel left out. But am having a blast here in the ORGNAME of ORGNAME and I cannot ask for anything better. I Love Austin. This were I been living for 00 years. I think I love music because of this "The Live Music Capital of the World" music was everywhere I turned in the neighbors house, down in the drive through of ORGNAME. In the Laundry thing and well my mom Loves to dance. Which leaves me think. What am I going to do with my obsession of taking pics of different artist that come and do concert. I love to meet them and makes my groups of friends grow more. "the artist" for most part are really down to earth and I look forward to every dance there is. Its Been two weeks since school started, yet our room still STINKS!!!!!! We cannot take the smell out. Being in the ninth floor. We cannot do much of it. plus were in the middle of Nowhere land stuck in a Corner were no body comes an visit us. That's good in some part because we can study and listen to music as high as we want to and none says anything. Its sunny outside its not HOT like it usually is. I love it when it rains but there is also going to rain. That little breeze of air that vlows thriugh my hair is unbelivable. I love that smell of wet grass as well. UMmmmmmmmmmmm. So one did PoPcoRn and I smell it all the way over here. 00,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 sorry I got distracted by the timer less then am done. It been distracting since it started 
__label__label1 my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty/sweaty boy. I came over to his apt to do this homework. and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves. I am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal. I'm usually a really fast typer, because I've had a computer for a long time. my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house. he wanted me to do computer science and I did as well, but when I came to UT I found out it is totally wrong for me. I just switched to retail merchandising and I'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than CS was. I think its funny how older people(no offense) are not really connected to the computer. the computer, can do so many wonderful things, I can't even see my life without one. don't think I'm a dork just because I said I was in CS, but take for example doing this homework online. its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it. it was a very easy/simple task. that's amazing. they said that my generation will spend like 00 years of there life online and I believe it. there is just so much to do online. I feel like I might be typing bad, but I'd like you to excuse that. I'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing. I wonder what you actually look for in these type of things, how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups. I mean I'd hate to see what you think of me now, but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true. so I totally love LOCNAME LOCNAME, she is such a riot. I think its funny people don't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show. but I wont get into that, however she came out with a new book. I want to read it, I think it will be amusing. on a side note, I'm not really sure why I'm eating cheetos, I don't really like them, just every now and then I crave them. I absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling. I just   dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in  your teeth. I really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself. I never realized 00 minutes would feel like so long. maybe because I'm starving and I just want to go eat and go to tops, it feels like that. I hate that. how are you suppose to do something  that feels like eternity. I feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go. I was going to do it earlier but I was having a hard time getting the pre-screening thing to work. then once I did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless. you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with, because its so freaking slow. I still have to go back and finish that and I dread it. however, I think my boyfriend is entertained now because I can here he is playing playstation two in the next room. gosh I'm so hungry and this is taking way to long. I have now moved on to goldfish to eat. speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating. wow. I feel bad that so many people have eating disorders, I know quite a few. so many things for girls to be stressed about. I hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all. they think its all just food related. I hate how little kids are so fat today. I wish people would help teach kids how to eat. they let them eat ANYTHING. they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise. or they don't set the example themselves. my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 0 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done ALL their homework and their daily chore. then they also get a snack  sized candy (the little bitty bite size) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat. then there are kids who drink like 0 cokes a day. crazy crazy. I wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy. we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music. its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation. I'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed. I can't imagine it not being computer timed. I can't imagine being the person who reads all this crap. it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important?  that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail. but that could happen anywhere I guess. I'm so hungry its not funny. I'm glad I don't have to pee or anything that would just suck. I feel like my mind is going blank because I'm so bored. I wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this. it would be easy. gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top doesn't have any numbers. like its keeping time per say. I'm quitting this at 0 o'clock even if this thing doesn't stop itself because I know I'll be over the time if I wait till 0 so you can't cut my grade cause your thing didn't work. oh crap this clock is fast so I'll quit like 0 min before 0 and that should be even. I feel like I started this at 0:00 hmmmmmm I can't really remember. damn it. this sucks ass. I don't see how this is helping you. just making me get annoyed because I don't know when I started so i dont know when I can end and just go on with my life. I wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder. I feel like this is pointless and I'm past my typing time. I have no concept of time, but I don't know if anyone really does. just depends on what they are doing or what's going on around them and etc. time is a funny thing. more goldfish to cure my growling stomach/boredom. ouch I just kicked the computer or something underneath me. and it hurt. to bad I'm not on my computer cause then I could be laying in bed doing this. wireless and laptops. genius. the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 0 minutes and counting. 0:00 will be the new time for completion. 0 more minutes. and I'm stumped. I don't know what to type/talk about. ooooooo 0 minutes and counting. ok randomness:  I am not sure what I'm going to do tonight, I might go to a party or something, however I'm not going to dress up really cause I'm just feeling a chill vibe. 0ne minute. . and probably have a few drinks, or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend. sweet guy. not sure we are completely on the same page, but we have years for that to develop. . Times up.
