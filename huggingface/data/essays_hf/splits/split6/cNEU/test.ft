__label__label0 The lights  are all out here in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Thank goodness PROPNAME has  this lap top so I can do this assignment. I still have to do the other one too. They both are due Friday. The lights just came on. I'm so relieved because now I can feel the air conditioning. I'm a little bit off the assignment because PROPNAME is watching me. PROPNAME says hi. she is really sick right now and her nose is always runny. she snotted on my bed. or maybe she just drooled. I don't really know. Tonight I need to go to the theta house and study. We have to get certain amount of hours done . I don't really want to read anymore of the LOCNAME LOCNAME by PROPNAME. It is like a history book. It  makes me want to fall asleep sometimes when I read it. The most interesting section was about the animals on the Plains. The little jackrabbit has a white patch on its butt so that whenever it is in danger or something it flares it up to communicate with it's own kind. I guess that's how it works. Right now it's talking about the north vs. the south and it is way boring. I have about 00 pages  to read tonight. It is a little overwhelming. sometimes I get behind  and feel real guilty about it because I want to keep up with all my classes. I need to do my math homework too. I kind of just feel like taking a nap until we go study but then I'll never get up. My bed is sooooooo  cozy. I just put on some pink sheets and they rock because they are soo soft. I kind of feel like watching Backdraft. Whichever PROPNAME guy is in it is really good looking. He reminds me of this LOCNAME guy that is living in  towers. He is really good looking obviously and really sweet too. He walked us home the other night from the LOCNAME house because he thought it was too dangerous. then he started talking about what church he went to. I was thinking this guy is too good to be true. But then someone told me that he had just broken up with his long time girlfriend because they are at separate colleges. I don't think I would like to get in the middle of that. If that's the only reason why they broke up then that's not enough. Because obviously they had something big to hold onto and not let go of just like that. But he is one of the better guys  I've seen around lately. I kind of want to just ver out tonight but I know that I'll feel bad about it later. I'm so into making good grades but I haven't quite gotten into the hang of doing homework in this new setting and everything. PROPNAME just called. I'll be living with her next year. I think it’ll be good. Me , PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. I don't really know her too too well. Seh and PROPNAME are friends. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and I have been hanging out a lot lately. She's so cool. It's really awesome to get to know people from different states and become close friends. She's from LOCNAME. LOCNAME is so random. What is in LOCNAME?  Maybe we'll all go there to see her family sometime. We might go to LOCNAME for The Rice game. Then I'll get to see my little brother. He is so cool. He's growing like a weed right now. It's crazy. Now that I'm gone he is like an only child. I hate that for him. Maybe he likes it a little. He gets all the attention now. I don't want to lose the awesome brother/sister relationship  that  we have right now because I'm 0 hours from home. 
__label__label1 Well, I figured I should write this right now while I have time. I am really busy lately. It kind of seems like I have no time for myself anymore. I am trying out for crew. There are a lot of people trying out though. I think like 000 people are going for 00 spots. I hope I make it though because I don't deal well with failure. I tried out for the soccer team and did not make it, but that was a little unfair because I did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did. So now everyone probably thinks I just wasn't good enough when that really was not the reason. I was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill. Oh well. I guess it taught me how to cope with failure. But it really hurts every time I fail. I tried to get into the business school and was denied. That got me so mad. There are all of these total morons in the business school. I know because I take classes with them and always make better grades than them. But alas, they can do what they want with their lives they entered right out of high school. Oh well. I am still going pre-law so it doesn't matter. Unfortunately my roommate and a lot of my friends are in it, so it is a constant reminder that I did not get in. But I think that all of this just makes me a stronger person. I am trying to be really involved this year. I am lifeguarding for the rec center. It is kind of fun, but I kind of dread going to work all the time. I just seem to have a lot of things on my plate. I had a fight with my boyfriend the other day. I am not sure if it was his fault or if I caused it because of all the stress I am under. Oh well. I think that things have really changed between me and my roommate too. Last year we used to be like best friends, but now things are different. She seems to be really distant. I am not sure what is wrong with her. Maybe it is my fault. I am not around as much as I used to be, so maybe she just wants more attention and is finding it elsewhere. She also has a boyfriend, so she spends a lot of time with him, which is fine with me. I just feel like things have totally changed. She went to a party last night and didn't invite me. Weird. I think I am really different from most people. I always seem to put everyone else's feelings before mine. I just don't understand why people don't do that. Or maybe I don't understand why I do that. Like, I would invite everyone to come with me if I was doing something cool. But all the people around me just I think are selfish. Maybe I just need to find a whole new group of friends. I mean, I had my first day of tryouts for crew, which was a pretty big deal to me. And when I see my boyfriend, he doesn't even ask how I did. He totally forgot about it. That gets me so mad. He seems to forget about everything. He then says how he is a bad boyfriend. Unfortunately, I have to agree with him. But don't get the wrong impression of me. I am actually a very happy person. I am just going through a lull right now. Once I get into a normal routine in my life I think I will be a lot happier. I just wish that my family was here. My parents live in LOCNAME, and it is hard with them so far away. At least my brother is here with me. That makes it a lot easier. I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here. I never realized how dependent I was on other people. I always thought of myself as a kind of loner, but I guess I really am not. I like being around people, and maybe I do get jealous when they do not choose to be with me. I think I really need to work on the jealousy thing. That is probably why I am having problems with my boyfriend. He finally made some friends here, so he hangs out with them. I think I also don't really trust him. I don't want him sharing intimate things about us to them. He was asking me the other day why I back away from intimacy and am afraid to talk about it. I just don't like talking about it. I consider it a private thing, and should just be shared between two people. It is nobody else's business. But I guess since we are in college, that is the way things are. Sex is on everyone's mind. But it just doesn't really seem to be on my mind very much. I would much rather just cuddle that have sex. Maybe I am weird, I don't know. But that drives my boyfriend crazy. He want's to have sex all the time. I think that is a major problem in our relationship. Oh well. Well, I guess my time is about up. I now have to go to crew again. I should do good today because it is strength training. I am pretty confident about that. Well, I guess I only have one more of these to write. That relieves some of my stress. Actually this was pretty cool doing this. I could just write down what I have been keeping inside. Pretty neat. 
__label__label0 Hello you wonderful people who are reading my paper. I hope you really really  enjoy this one after all ORGNAME other ones you have read. Anyway right now I am  really excited because I'm just about to go to the ORGNAME ORGNAME the ORGNAME concert. I'm hoping that I have a blast and I know I will. My brother and a  lot of my friends came up for this concert. So, I will be able to see them. AIN'T THAT THE GREATEST THING. Earlier today, I was wishing that I could fly. The reason for that is that we  were stuck in traffic. Just think about it, just flying through the air, your hair flying back, brushing across your face--but I guess if we could fly, we  wouldn't think that much about it. Yesterday, I got an e-mail from my sister. It was really COOL and all, and she should come visit me soon. My sister is the one person in my family that I  really enjoy--but enough about that. I'm going to a concert, and to party!    Oh, just to throw something in here. I was noticing that many people here get  really excited about going out and staying out till whatever time in the  morning. I think this is really hilarious because I come from LOCNAME, LOCNAME. That is a border-town to LOCNAME (not that it could be LOCNAME in LOCNAME). Well,  we have clubs and discos in LOCNAME that are just a few minutes away so I'm  use to going out, staying out late, and drinking. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that most of the people here have not been able to go out and have  fun during their high school years--whether this is attributed to their parents or themselves. That is why there is such a high drop-out rate here in LOCNAME, and why a lot of students struggle just to pass.  I hope pass all my classes with A's if possible. I'm planning to be a plastic  and reconstructive surgeon, and I kind of need a great GPA to get into ORGNAME  ORGNAME. Oh by the way, I want to clear up the reason why I want to be that  kind of a surgeon. Many people believe that plastic surgeons are doctors who are just in the business for money. Some people don't even consider doctors as real doctors. They are seen as individuals who help superficial people stay  young and beautiful. Although plastic surgeons may do this, they help build up the self-esteem of the patient. There are some people who were born with  defects or were in a really bad accident, plastic/reconstructive surgeons help these people enter the world again. Most people with some type of defect  usually have a low self-esteem. Therefore, they do not really enjoy life nor do they participate in daily activities with other people. Plastic/reconstructive surgeons allow these people to enter into the world. They feel better about  themselves and as a whole their spiritual self is improved. This is vital to  the survival of the individual--for without it there is nothing to live for. Well, I'm going now hope I didn't bore you too much!  :>                                                                                            
__label__label0 I'm at home right now. it's weird because I don't really live here anymore  sine my new home is at LOCNAME. 'm glad I got to come and see my dog and my cats. they miss me alot. I love my sister. she already says she wants to be a d-g  and she knows nothing about it but that her big sis is one. I have so much  to do that it's crazy. I feel like no mater what I do there's always something  else to do. I am sooooooo excited about Friday. my ex-boyfriend is diving down  from tech to see me. it's been over a month since I’ve seen him. I can't  decide what to do about him. we get along great. he can treat me well, when  he doesn't he doesn't do it on purpose. I know that this sounds pathetic but  it's not. I’m confused because I want us to get back together this weekend but I also want to just be friends. it's just that I love him so much and could see myself married to him. I know that he loves me. he said that he wanted us to get back together, but we'll see what happens. it's amazing how the boy is  always on my mind. I mean, the more I try to stop, the worse it gets. I guess that's how you know that you're in love. ok, it's been ten minutes and I still  have ten to go. yeah, not. I hate to write. I hate that I had to take freshman English because I got at 000 instead of a 000 on my sat0. dumb. the class will be  easy though. I like college life. the only class I’m scared of is calculus. I was supposed to take it in high school but was busy with dance and pals so I didn't take it. big mistake. I’ve forgotten so much stuff since junior year. my lil sis is a big sophomore now. she still seems so young to me. my parents went to the airport to get my older bro. he's the perfect son-national merit scholar, works for my dad, etc. the cowboys won today. I was exited. PROPNAME, my ex, and I used to bet on the cowboy games. this reminds me to copy that e-mail he wrote. he was fighting with this other guy over me. how romantic. I miss him alot. I’m so glad I get to see him this weekend. I know that this is materialistic, but I’m worried about what to wear. I have this effect on him that he can't resist me(I know it sounds like I have an ego, but he has the same effect on me which makes it so hard) it was easy when I’d see him every day because it made him want to be with me. but I’m worried now that he's  away, he'll forget about his woman in LOCNAME. but whatever's mean to be will be. I’m very religious, but today I didn't go to church. it's hard to find time in college. excuses, excuses. I need to go by and oil-absorbing mask. my oily skin is gross. well, I’d love to sit here and type some more, but my time is about up and I have to go to the store before my parents and brother get home for family hamburgers night. I can't decide if I’m going home to UT tonight or not. I think I might just stay here but I can't decide. hope that my  mind helps you in this experiment or whatever this is. I can't to learn about all this mind stuff. it looks coll. well, bye for now. ps- I feel like I  just wrote a long e-mail to a friend. maybe that's what I’ll do now. 
__label__label1 I am in the computer, I wish I’m I bed right now, God I'm tired. Are my doing this right I sure hope so. Do I need to hit return after each line. Man this is harder than I thought. only 0 mins past. I wanna go  eat lunch now. Boy I type fast. That girl is really good looking, I wonder what her name is. That music is  really loud will you please turn it down!  The computer lab is closing in 00 mins, I think I can finish before then. Man this is weird, writing down want you are thinking. I need to go back to LOCNAME and bring my basketball here. I missed my room. Need help?  The lab assistant is there to answer any of your questions, yeah right, that  girl here yesterday was no help at all. I wish I have a computer in my dorm. I wonder if my roommate is still asleep. I should be sleeping to. I think I did this in high school, but I’m not sure if it's the same thing. I really need this ten points, so I better get a good grade on this. I missed PROPNAME, I wish she's here with me  right now. I wanna an ice cream. Boy this is Boring, I really do think about a lot of things. Turn the music  down damn it. Hey I like this computer. Do I need to print this out?  Boy two more papers to go. I wonder if PROPNAME will go out with me ever, nah, she's not my type any ways. Do I need to do this in Paragraphs, I sure hope not God How long do I have to do this. I'm thinking about what do think now. yes today is the 0th. nice hat. I need  some money. Shoot, gotta do my math homework later, man this sucks. I gotta go eat lunch before my next class, how much  time left for this thing? I think he got the same class with me. Where is PROPNAME, we gota do the topic thing together. I wonder what is on TV today. I think the computer lab is about to close. Can they tell how long I have been writing this? I don't wanna go to Jester West. Cute girl. nice mouse pad. I really need a computer. Man she is tall. I really think I did this in High School. Today is the ORGNAME award, yes. Oh no, I gota a meeting session, I think I’ll skip it. I can't, I got to  turn in my homework, man this is not good. How long has been. I really should have kept track of time better, I Think is been  00 mins now. I'll write a little more just in case. I hope my friends waited for me to go to lunch, they better. I need to go to the gym  again today, do I have enough time?  The lab is kinda empty now, may be I should go too. I'm sure it's been 00 mins at least. okay five  more mins and I’ll go to lunch k. What is he writing over there, I think it's a web pager. Why didn't this web pager work yesterday? nice screen saver, I think I’ll get one too when I fix my computer. I wanna a lap top. I'm getting sleepy and I just woke up too, boy this is boring. Do I really think about all these different thing before, nah. okay the lab is closing, I think I should go to lunch now bye. Yes, one down two to go. 
__label__label1 So what should I write? I have no clue. Oh, about the survey I did in the  class today. It's pretty good. I mean I like the one on homosexuality. I  am gay, and I know my answers are very biased. To me, I either strongly  agree or strongly disagree. Hey, it's about my identity and the society  I am living in. I have to, sort like, defend for what I believe in,  although I don't have much choices in picking my own identity. What am I  thinking? Why am I so excited about it? I have come out for a rather long  period of time, yet I am still nervous about the whole issue. I am a very  lucky guy, I have not met a lot resistance from the society as a whole. Somehow, I only have the problem finding the right guy. When I was young,  I have those innocent thoughts about love and romance. I have always  believed that there definitely is a right guy for me. Yeah, that was a huge joke. As I become more mature, I become more practical, just like everyone  else. All right, I shall only speak for myself. I know love to me is a  pathetically realistic concept. No more space for imagination. God, why am  I writing this? I had just promised myself to forget about the existence  of love, right after the PROPNAME issue. It shall not work for me. I am too pretentious, arrogant, determined, etc. Anyway, moving on to something else. Man, there are 00 more minutes left. The sky is so dark. I wonder what is  out there. I know one thing is that I am not scared of anything. I want to  know, I want to discover, I want to enjoy life beyond it's practical  dimensions. There is the moon. No, I am lying. The moon is not visible at the beginning of the month. Well, I wish I could see it though. I have  heard enough Chinese stories about the angels on the moon. I hope I can live there sometimes. The earth is too complicated, and it is also very cruel. I just want to go somewhere and forget all the problems and relieve all the  stress. I really just want to be with my closest friends for a little while  and leave everything else alone. Oh, not possible. Why am I writing this. I swear to God that I have never been so senseless before. My fingers are  typing things which my mind cannot direct. Weird, I need help. Maybe this  is the point of this assignment, to get lost and throw away the conscious. Ok, 0 more minutes. What am I going to do this weekend? How about 0th  street. I really like Paradox. The music is good and so is the place. Yep, that's it. Friday night hanging out with pals. Cool. Maybe I can meet some cute guys. Oh, come on, my brain is out. My roommate is home. Finally. I gotta go, time is up, my fingers are little tired. Bye. 
__label__label0 This the third time that I am typing this thing. I am so frustrated. Every time I get close to the 00 minutes I get cut off. There is a party I want to go to now I am here stuck here spending an hour doing this thing. I don't know what to type because I am tired of staring at this screen. It seems as if in the past two weeks  I have had no time to myself. Between pledgship, school, and studying, I have no time. The only time I spend in my room, is done sleeping. I am just going to describe what is going on in sportscenter because I haven't watched it in about a week. PROPNAME PROPNAME is talking about the upcoming pro football games this weekend. I used to idolize berman. I also liked dick vitale. I was so obsessed that I wrote him a letter. a few weeks later I got a copy of his book with a personalized note on the inside. I am halfway done!   I am starting to calm down. I have never been to hot-headed. I try to keep a level head all the time. The only time I really cut loose is when I am in a competition that I feel I can win. this may not be very often but when it does happen I thrive on the situation. Only eight minutes left. I really respect PROPNAME PROPNAME. he is the catcher for the rangers, my hometown team. I also like ken griffey jr, he seems like a team player that gives his all every game. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a very large man, he won't win any stolen bases titles anytime. only five minutes left. I like the expos and pirates, just because every year they are competitive even though they have no money to win with. they are building their team through the farm systems, which is how it should be done. I hope to get good grades. I wish this assignment was over. I love college football. I loved to play football but I never was big enough of fast enough to play up to the level I wanted to . I hate danny  schayes. his dad was a great basketball player. One minute left!!  my favorite team is the cowboys. I love going to the games and cheering them on to victory. I think my time is up so I will write later!  the simpsons is the best show on tv by the way. and caddyshack is the bast movie ever! 
__label__label0 My roommate has a poster of a wolf beside the computer. it looks like an Alaskan husky my aunt has. I saw a wolf once and a coyote ran across the road in front of me while I was driving. My friend PROPNAME was with me and said did you see that as if I didn't see a big coyote run in front of my car . PROPNAME is not very bright but I feel sorry for him because he doesn’t have many friends. We worked together one summer on a farm and he didn’t work very hard and that makes me mad because I had to do most of the work. I just sneezed and every time I sneeze I do it more than once my mother is the same way she sneezes three or four times in a row . I am sure she misses me a lot right now . I can't believe she cried when I left to move to college. That embarrasses me but at least she cares about me. She has more respect for me than my older brother and that makes me mad because I love my brother and he is a good person but since he went of to college and messed up a little she has in her on way shunned him. And now my family looks at me like I am the good child. I am not good but they think I am. Whenever I got my first job my parents thought I was so responsible . I hated that job. I hate ORGNAME to this day . All the people who worked there made me feel like a snob because I was actually going to go to college one day instead of working at ORGNAME for 00 years . Why am I still upset about a job I quit 0 years ago . That's like PROPNAME PROPNAME cheated on me in the 0th grade and I will never forgive her . It hurt so bad . I mean, I have had a different girlfriend who I love very much for the last three years but I still hate PROPNAME PROPNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME was her best friend and used to be mine but she stopped talking to me because she felt she was too good to talk to me . People would think I am crazy for saying that but that is the truth. Now I am feeling guilty for just complaining about stuff in a homework paper to people who don't even know me and now I feel like when anyone reads this paper they will think that I am a guy with a lot of problems. I am actually a very stable person all my friends come to me for help because I give good advice. I really hope someone can read this paper because I am trying to be honest and type everything I am thinking while I am thinking it but it doesn't always come out in readable text . I am worried about this class because PROPNAME said that students who took some Psychology in High school do worse in his class than others . I don't think I am the kind of person to rest on my laurels but maybe I am deluding myself . One thing that bothers me is whenever I think I am not being honest to myself. Does that make sense ? Now I feel like I am talking to a Psychologist and he is analyzing all that I say and I feel really foolish . How stable am I really?  I don't care. I like my life and anyone who says that I have problems can kiss my butt because they have problems of their own. We all have problems but that doesn't keep most of us from functioning. I got a feeling I won't do very good on this paper  and I guess I am feeling "anxiety" but I have been typing for well over 00 minutes and I have shared much more than I really wanted to, to people who don't really care and frankly I am tired. One of my many faults is that I am too trusting and any time I talk to anyone I reveal too much . Thank you for your time . Sorry for this mess (my life or paper, take it either way) Hasta luego 
__label__label1 My roommate is trying to sleep, so I hope that I am not going to bug her by typing. I'm using her computer because mine is at home. I have no idea how to use the internet I need to go get my e-mail address so that I have one but I don't feel like it. I still have to get my books for two more classes tomorrow morning- I can't forget that. I miss my boyfriend- I hope he comes down this weekend cuz' I can't go up there again till he comes down to see me-I just wouldn’t feel tight about it. He is such a jerk-I wish I could just meet someone else and get over him but it's so hard. I can't believe that PROPNAME and PROPNAME broke up this weekend-that's so sad. It seems so weird that relationships can totally dissolve so fast-where do the bonds you had with these people go so suddenly?  Relationships are so weird-love is weird. I would really like to meet someone that I am as attracted to as I am to PROPNAME and that I love undoubtedly and someone who I know loves me that way, too. I would give anything to know exactly hoe PROPNAME feels about me-why does he still have to play games with me-I f he cares about me, he should tell me-I do. I wonder what he will think when he gets that letter-I hope it doesn't freak him out-maybe I should have sent it-he's probably going to let all his friends read it and then I'll feel like a dumbass like always. I keep making mistakes and I know we aren't supposed to worry about them but I can't quit fixing them. I wonder if anyone will actually ever read this?  I wish my roommate’s boyfriend and his friend would leave-they've been here three freaking days-that’s a little inconsiderate-I think and she keeps drinking all my lemonade-doesn't she realize that costs me money-I wouldn’t care if she'd ask-but that is so rude, she doesn't even say thank you. That guy gives me the creeps and he just sits on our coach all day. I wish PROPNAME and PROPNAME could call me with their phone number-I really miss them. I need to call PROPNAME, too, and see what sorority she got into. I wonder if she's seen PROPNAME and PROPNAME-will that all stay friends?  I feel left out-I wonder in LOCNAME saw the bracelets-she will be so pissed at me if she did-I'll call her after 0. I can't wait to go play volleyball-I've got to finish my drama reading after this, too. I wonder if I am doing this right-I can't tell exactly what thoughts to write cuz some come to me while I'm writing others and then I lose them-I  need to write a poem-I've been losing so many good ideas and that pisses me off. only 00 more minutes to go. I haven’t typed in along time,  I would love to be with PROPNAME right now-I am so glad that I haven't been thinking about him as much as I did before we moved-That would kill me, maybe I'm shielding myself a little cuz I still; feel like he is going to be the first person to really really hurt me-why is it that my self esteem hinges so much on his interest in me?  That is certainly not healthy, why did I just type certainly instead of definitely was thinking defiunatle, that was an idea for a poem that I still haven’t written down I need to remember that-I hope I like my poetry class-it will suck if I hate it after all the trouble I went to get in it. I'm glad that the part about my roommate’s boyfriend is gone now, I'm afraid she’d walk in and read it-now she'll walk in and read this-oh well-three days is too long-I wonder if PROPNAME will stay the night here when he comes or at t0m's house of that other guy who lives in LOCNAME. I am anxious to go to College Station thought, but will I stay at PROPNAME's house or at PROPNAME and Lori's house. Will that be mad at me if I stay at PROPNAME's. The computer just went back to the main menu cuz I guess I pushed Ctrl-whatever that menas-0 more minutes-I am so glad I didn't just lose the whole thing-I'd have been pissed beyond belief-my hands are getting tired. I have heartburn from my dada's chili still-I hate chili-why did I eat that anyway?  I can't believe Princess PROPNAME is dead-it seems so weird-she is just as vulnerable as anyone but it never seems that way-now two princesses have died in car accidents-cars are so dangerous-time is up-Yay! 
__label__label1 I just got back from aerobics. It was really hard and kicked my butt today. I learned how to box. I really wish I knew how to box. I could kick PROPNAME PROPNAME's butt. PROPNAME PROPNAME lives 0 minutes from my house in LOCNAME. I have seen his house before and it is really cool. PROPNAME lives around there. I wish I could punch PROPNAME's face in now. He is such a jerk. I hope he is happy without me. That was a profound statement. This assignment is so boring. Why do we have to do this. I hope I don't fail out of college. My dad would kick my butt and make me go to ORGNAME ORGNAME. That is not cool. I would absolutely kill myself if I had to go to LOCNAME college. PROPNAME went to ORGNAME ORGNAME. now he goes to Tech. haha. I wonder if I will ever see him again. Maybe so. PROPNAME is so much better than he is. I wish PROPNAME would have asked me out a year ago instead of PROPNAME. I have so much work to do tonight and I'm so tired. plus I have to got o that mixer tomorrow night. But I hope I don't have to go to my eight o clock class tomorrow. eight o clock classes should be outlawed. No one should have to be awake that early. The food here really sucks. My Mom's cooking is so much better than this stuff. it's like prison food. That was really gross in the move Sleepers when PROPNAME PROPNAME's character made those boys eat their food off the prison floor. Then he beat them up. That movie was really disturbing. I bet stuff like that goes on in all kinds of prisons. I 'm against the death penalty. "Why do we kill people to show  other people that killing is wrong?"  That is my most favorite quote of all time. PROPNAME PROPNAME's character deserved to die though. PROPNAME PROPNAME is really good looking. Every time I see him in a movie, I remember him dancing in Footloose and I start to laugh. His character's name in that movie Was PROPNAME. Like PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I hat that show. It used to be really funny, but now it is just disgusting. These guys that eat in the Kinsolving cafeteria are disgusting. None of the good-looking guys come by our dorm. We must be losers. Why would they come by our dorm?  We are the best looking girls in our dorm. Everyone else is disgusting. Except for PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I'm glad PROPNAME and I are becoming friends. It is really cool how her dad and my dad roomed together and now PROPNAME an d I will room together in our apartment next year. I think my dad wants me to room with her and PROPNAME in a apartment next year. Maybe one other girl. I can't even think to next year. I will be 00 on Friday. That seems so old. PROPNAMEss PROPNAME was 00 when she married Prince PROPNAME, I think. That is so sad that she died. I've watched so many news stories on her lately. It makes me sad. I want to watch the funeral on Saturday. I hope we get home from LOCNAME on time. I'm excited to go to Waco. It will be so much fun and PROPNAME will make my birthday really nice. Although he is trying too hard. That is a turnoff. But he is such a sweet guy that I could never do anything to hurt him. He has really low self-esteem. And he is quite inexperienced. He is so much better than any of the other guys I have dated--but I don’t know if I like him. I like jerk guys I guess. Really good-looking cocky guys. Like Mark. and PROPNAME. and PROPNAME. I wonder why PROPNAME never liked me. I wish he would have. Even though he is a player, I bet I could change him. Yeah right. Wishful thinking. He is the best looking guy I have ever dated. Even though it was a short fling. It was worth it. He is so good-looking. Why does PROPNAME put up with a jerk like him for a best friend?  I have no clue. Poor PROPNAME--I think he lives in PROPNAME's shadow most of the0 time. That really sucks. I'm glad I don't do that. I can't wait for the weekend--It will be awesome. And I also can't wait for the 00 minutes to be up so I can finish this stupid assignment. My hands are getting tired. I should add that to my list of aches and pains form my aerobics class. I hope PROPNAME doesn't come to that class on Thursday. I don't think PROPNAME and I could stand it. Well, my time is almost up and I need to do my other buttloads of homework tonight. Later. 
__label__label0 I can't believe it!  It's really happening!  My pulse is racing like mad. So this is what it's like. now I finally know what it feels like. just a few more steps. I wonder if he is going to get any sleep tonight!?  I sure won't!  Well, of course I have a million deadlines to meet tomorrow so I'll be up late anyway. But OH! I'm so so excited!  Yes!  Yes!  I can't believe it is finally happening. Wait! Calm down. We aren't officially a couple yet. What if I end up not liking him?  That would be horrible. Oh great, I wonder how long it'll take me to finish those Calculus problems?  I'll get it done. Don't you always, PROPNAME?  I can't believe PROPNAME did it!  He really did it!  He is THE miracle worker. If things turn out all right I will owe him more than I can ever repay. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing in LOCNAME right now?  An entire month!  I'll likely clean out his refrigerator by then. Omigosh!  Food, lunch tomorrow, what will I ever say to him?  He is perfect in every way imaginable. It is so important for him to think of me the same way. well, maybe not Perfect, but certainly dynamic. Who would have ever thought!  Good things do indeed come to those who wait!  Oh, I'll have to remember to sign the poster he made tomorrow morning. I hope PROPNAME's alarm clock is reliable and I don't oversleep. That would be tragic if I slept 'til noon and missed the lunch. Thank goodness PROPNAME is coming along. I will definitely need her support as well as PROPNAME's. just having her there will take away some of the tension and put me more at ease. I'll have to rehearse what I say beforehand. things can only get better from here, right? hopefully. oh, I'm so nervous!  He will be too. maybe even more so. it'll be ok. Why in the world do humans put themselves through such torture. maybe love is really worth it?    
__label__label1 I just sat down at a computer in the lobby of srd, which is where I live. I just finished checking my e-mail since my computer in my room has not yet been equipped with an Ethernet. My boyfriend e-mailed me because he just got home. He goes to ORGNAME. He hates it there, though, and wants to transfer here in the spring. I am perturbed by the method of typing this computer is set up with. why doesn't it automatically wrap to the beginning on the visible screen. sorry, I can be really anal at times. I am sorry if this looks messed up, but I couldn’t figure out how this works. sorry again. I sure am glad this isn't going to be graded, or else my body paragraph would get an "f". I really miss my boyfriend. I am nervous about my dance-team tryout today. I don't know if I am in good enough shape to make the team. I haven't danced in like four months, and I am really out of shape. I am adjusting pretty good I guess to the whole college experience. I have made many new friends , and already have done things with them. for example, my friend heather and I are going shopping at the mall at 0 to get my boyfriend a birthday present. I am misspelling words right and left huh. I am kinda excited about learning psychology. the brain chapter, I hear, is confusing, but all of the case studies should be interesting  I have no more classes today, but I need to finish reading my chapter one in psych. and my chapter two in chemistry. My boyfriend cam for a visit this weekend. I think he had a good time. We went out to eat at El arroyos, which was rumored to have good Tex-Mex food. They were right, alright. some of the best I've ever tasted. we then went to comedy sports, an improv club at northcross mall. it was hysterical. the members of the teams respond to impromptu suggestions from the audience. He stayed with friends at towers and called me the minute he woke up on Saturday. he came over to srd and  we went shopping on the drag. I got two T-shirts, a baseball cap, and two books from the co-op. he got some u. t. memorabilia to take home with him to try and persuade his parents to let him come here in the spring. he is going to have a tough time explaining it to them, I think, because they will undoubtedly think that the only reason he wants to come here is because I’m here. I don't know how much weight that pulls in his decision, but I hope that isn't the basis for his decision. he started out at ORGNAME because they are said to have a good pre-med program, which is ultimately his goal. he met with the hpo office while he was here, and met with an advisor about the science program here. he was impressed that it was so similar to ORGNAME's. We then went over to the admissions office so that he could meet with someone about credits needed to transfer and other such items. He needs 00 hours to transfer, and after fall he will have 00, so he hopes to be accepted as a transfer student. PROPNAME just walked in and said Hi!. now she looked at my screen I'm not crazy, I am doing stream of consciousness assignment for pschology. as she nods. she is a nice girl. she lives down the hall from me.  I needed to get this done today because I have plans for the rest of the week after Wednesday, since this is a two day assignment. I should've recorded what time I started typing, huh!  that would have been beneficial. I’m retarded in that sense. i mean sometimes I have no common sense. I wonder what my grades will be like this semester. I am used to straight A’s, and I hope I can accomplish this in college as well. I need to petition my AP grades sometime soon, but I don't know when or where. oh, well, I’ll look it up somewhere, and get it done. I need to do some laundry today, too. I am running out of plain little T-shirts, what's a girl to do. maybe I’ll find something cute while I’m shopping today. I hoe my boyfriend ( PROPNAME is his name, if you wanted to know) likes his present. i think I am going to get him a ring from james avery and have it engraved. always. that is what I am engraving into it. so he'll remember. I am kinda sore from my dance class this morning. all we are doing is stretching but it takes alot out of me. I need to take a shower this evening sometime, cuz I am still kinda sweating from walking from like the stadium back home. in case you didn't know I live at 00th and the drag, so its a good hike to and from classes. I think I have been typing for twenty minutes so I am going to submit this. I wonder what happens if I didn't type for twenty minutes. what if I don't get credit. maybe I’ll keep going for another minute. I checked my mailbox when I came in, and I didn't have any new packages. my dad supposedly sent one on Friday, but it hasn't arrived yet. I think I am running out of things to say, so I’ll let you go on to whoever's paper is next in line. 
__label__label0 sitting here just writing stuff down on paper. thinking about going out tonight. I’m pretty happy because the navy paid me some more money. so there is money to go out with. I’m doing this on paper hoping it's a little easier than just typing. time goes slow when you are waiting on it. that girl is really cute. I can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. I’m not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. I don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. I can't do it. I wonder what they'll do. probably not much I’ll have about three quarters of I so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 0 o'clock. extra study. the ORGNAME unit is good that way I guess I wonder how late I have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter I guess but I want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so I plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. I need to but I doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study. I think that's time I hope this is close to what the assignment was. my mind is pretty simple so it's hard to write for that long about what it's doing. 
__label__label0 I have a feeling this is going to be a long 00 minutes. I don't even know where to start, and I don't think I really care. oh well. ORGNAME plays LOCNAME LOCNAME tonight. I hope ORGNAME crushes them. I wish I was in LOCNAME right now. Sunny skies and 00 degrees. My roommate is an idiot. I don't think he thinks before he speaks. He is the clumsiest person I have ever met. what else should I say?  I still feel sick from last night. Too much Beast!!  I've got to get replenished for tonight. Lots of good football and beer. Hopefully some bitches will be here. I smell food in the kitchen. I'm hungry as fuck. All I’ve eaten this morning is Fruity Pebbles. I love Fruity Pebbles. I need more milk from the store. The ORGNAME play tomorrow night at 0:00. LOCNAME is the greatest city in the world. Nobody does it better!!  I can't wait to get home in a month or so. I need to go to the bathroom, but I guess I can hold it in for another 00 minutes. This is a waste of time. I wonder what you people can find out from this stuff. Random thoughts are weird. My eyes hurt. I need to go to the bathroom. It sounds like LOCNAME is beating ORGNAME. I hate ORGNAME. ORGNAME is the shit!!  I need to call my old roommate from ORGNAME. I need to eat. This is boring. I wonder how much time I have left. It looks like 00 minutes more. My roommate is obnoxious. He never stops talking and usually says nothing of importance. I think he has some serious problems. Maybe not. The girl next door is hot. I hope she comes over tonight to watch the UT game. She's got a great body. I'm still hungry. I need to get a job. My funds are running a little low. I waste too much money. I hope I win the lottery tonight. I hate this assignment. I guess it's pretty easy though. I better get an A in this class. I hate BA000. It is a pointless class. I need to do my assignment in there. I miss my homies in LOCNAME. I love kickin' it with them. You can't beat good friends and good beer. I wonder why I like to drink. It makes me feel good at the time, but I feel like shit every morning. I don't even remember when I started to drink in high school. Malt liquor is nasty, but when you're on a budget it hits the spot. Magnum. When I turn 00 I'm going to go nutty. LOCNAME LOCNAME here I come. only 0 more months. I better not fuck up when I turn 00. I need to keep getting good grades. Only 0 more years of this crap. I can't say that I've learned anything significant in college. All it's taught me is that you have to have one to get a job, but from there it is all on your shoulders. I like my summer job. Real world experience is better than book learning. I'm pretty sure they will hire me on after I graduate. I love computers. I guess that's why I'm an MIS major. They have so much power it is unbelievable. I need to eat. When I'm done maybe I’ll order a pizza. My roommate is so loud. I'm gonna yell at his lazy ass. All he does while I'm at school is sleep and watch TV. Rough life. I need to take out the trash. I need to get some beer for tonight. Maybe something ritzy. I need to get a job. I wish all assignments were this easy. Too many classes and not enough time. I need to find a girlfriend. The girl next door has potential. It's Party Time by PROPNAME PROPNAME is on the radio. It's the jam. I love rap music. The beats are great and that's why I love it. He is the clumsiest person in the world. If my window is broken I will kick his ass. What a fool. It's Party time, whoa yeah it's party time, we havin a party. Time's up. 
__label__label1 Well, I am sitting in the library right now, you know the one across from  LOCNAME LOCNAME. I am hard at work trying to think of things and writing  them down as I go along. Oh, I just heard someone moving in  his seat making  a creaking noise. There he goes again. Why can’t he this guy sit still. Boy am I sleepy, my neck has a cramp and there goes that guy again moving in  his in his seat. Oh, the fountain (I had to look up for this one) is making  noise. Okay. it stopped now. Boy am I tired. I wish I was sleeping right now. I can hear people walking in the distance and someone flipping through pages  in a book. I wonder what he is looking for. It is probably something for his  ultra tough class. Man, I am tired. Excuse me but I have to stop writing for  a second. Boy I really can not see anything without my glasses. My eyesight  must be really bad. Go figure, I have been wearing glasses since the 0th grade. I liked them at first and thought they were cool but I despise wearing glasses. It hurts my ears and gives me a headache  sometimes. Ah, just needed to pull  the chair in a little. Man, I wish someone was here to massage my neck and  shoulder, preferably a girl. This just can not get any worse, now I am  beginning to feel pain in my forearm from writing so much. I think I am really  out of shape for my forearm to be hurting so much. Wow, this is truly horrific,  everything around me is a blur. Man, if someone killed every one in this room  and I saw him. I would probably not be able to identify him or even describe  him to the police. Boy, my sight is so bad. Good, I only have about eight more  minutes of writing. I wish I can go to sleep right now, but no, I have to  finish this writing assignment. Man, does this mean I would have to type this  on the computer. Great, well I will be getting out of here real soon. Oh, I can  see much better now. What is with the neck cramp. Things could not get any  worse for me. Here I am sitting here and having to write for at least twenty  minutes on the stream of my conscience. My eyes are drooping and heavy, my  chest is in pain from the way I am sitting, and my right arm is so tired. Please stop! Dude, I have about three more minutes. Time sure flies by real  fast. Yeah right! Cool, that guy has an outline of a roadrunner on the back of  his shirt. Man, well is he not a little too noisy. I mean we are in the library,  man, and people are trying to do a writing assignment for psychology here, man. Dude, I just heard the door opened and shut. Alright, I can finally stop now. Hope you like it. That was twenty minutes of my life down the tube. Thanks a  lot. Just kidding. Ha! Ha! 
__label__label0 I finally got into this thing. that took forever. I hate asking questions so it took even longer. I think people are always thinking weird things about me, which I know is bad , but I always do. the good thing is that everyone I've come in contact here has been really helpful. I really cant wait for this weekend. the weeks are so long. I haven’t made any new friends here. I have a lot friends that  came with me from high school to LOCNAME and to other schools in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I see them every weekend. I’m being really antisocial right now. the thing is that the friends I have are really close to me, and they know everything there is to know about me, and vice versa. I spent the last two years of my life with them, it may not seem like a lot but it was two very important years of my life. I feel really comfortable around them. I m not good at  meeting people so I cant imagine being at  the same level of friendship with other people especially in college where everyone just does their own thing. so I look forward to every weekend. people around me probably think I’m weird sitting here just typing continuously. I’m sure, actually I’m almost positive there are weirder people here. id really like to finish this already, but I just looked at the clock and I still have time left. I’m going home, back to LOCNAME LOCNAME next Friday. its going to be strange. I never expected to go back so soon. I was with this girl for about 0 months before I left, and it was really serious. we talked about spending the rest of our lives together. she was supposed to move here, but she had issues and commitments that were obviously more important. She cane to visit last month for about 0 weeks before school started. we got in  a big fight and she left on really bad terms. it was my fault, but I couldn’t have her leave on good terms or it would have hurt more. so I acted like a jerk and we fought the last week and a half she was here constantly. Anyway I’m really afraid of running into her, because ill be there for a whole weekend and we hang out a t the same places. I think its really funny how a lot of people here think LOCNAME LOCNAME is so small. its as big as LOCNAME, and no one knows it. ki heard someone say that they though it only had one high school. it actually has 00-00. oh well it rally doesn’t matter, I’m glad I’m here now. I really like it,  I cant believe I’m in college and actually grown up and that I actually have real responsibilities. but I very lonely. I miss her so much, and she wants to try the whole long distance relationship thing, but I cant. I really loved her. I've never been so close to anybody in my life, and after everything we shared and as close as we were, it seems like ill never experience that again with anybody. and if I do finally find someone and then we break up I have to go through this whole pain thing again. I know its normal to feel like this, I just moved away from a city I've lived in for 00 years and I just broke up with someone I was prepared to spend the rest of my life with, but its all a little overwhelming. the thing that bothers me the most is that all this takes up too many of my thoughts, and it takes away from what I really should be concentrating on. I really want  to do well here at LOCNAME, I have a lot to prove to a lot of people. I’m sick of always having this sob story attached to my life. I went to an all boys private school that was small compared to other high school, my graduating class was about 000. everyone knew that I moved out of my house and how I had trouble with my mom, and everyone feel sorry for me, and I’m sick of this whole drama thing, my life is so full of drama.  I went over by a few minutes I guess that’s all   
__label__label1 wanna see the real you- I love this song. by the suicide machines. I saw them last spring break with the descendents. good show. now green world is on. this is weird, trying to write continuously for 00 minutes. you tend to think  differently when you're forced to. like today, those questionnaires in psych class. I think I analyzed them too much and tricked myself into answering  differently. oh well. I have a lot of shit I need to be doing like returning that journalism book and buying the packet for that class. that class sucks. how  can journalists shove a camera and microphone in someone’s face when they’re in mourning or whatever. and those guys who caused the princess Di's wreck just for some pictures. it makes me sick. do they have no feelings or sympathy  whatsoever? does anyone? how the hell am I going to find a job that I like that doesn’t require making it to the top, no matter who you step on to get there. I guess all jobs are like that I’m just not a competitive person at all. never was. I don’t need to put other people down or be the best at everything in order to feel good or proud like tough guys. sure I’m proud of what I can do but I could  never hurt another soul doing it. well the music’s off now and its quiet here in  my castilian dorm room except for the fan. my boyfriend and my friends are  upstairs, probably watching t. v. I wonder if he wants to go to that less than  PROPNAME show tonight I want to. they’re pretty good. my back hurts. I need to go  to a chiropractor cant believe this stuff going through my head. how boring. I do think about interesting things sometimes. a few nights ago my boyfriend (PROPNAME) and me and three other girls got into a huge (drunk) argument about  how the world would be different if women were in all power. then we starting  arguing, are gender differences biological or environmental? kevin thinks  they’re environmental, and has a nerdy, stubborn, math/scientist guy and shows  very little emotions. marita and I said no, its about 00/00, because women are  born with these instincts that men will never know until they grow uteruses  and give birth. ok I have 0 more minutes to write. my hair feels weird. I cut  about a foot off 0 days ago. it was down to my waist now its to my chin. I feel  bald. I wonder if I should dye it again. last year it was purple. man I’m doing  it again, rambling on about boring stupid shit. I wonder if everyone else  sounds as dumb as me, chatting away about stuff nobody really cares  about. for twenty minutes. all to make a good grade. why is so much emphasis  placed on grades I wonder. they don’t measure your intelligence. some people  always do their homework and make good grades. that me. some people study and  study but still bomb tests. that’s me too. tests suck. especially true false  questions. I analyze those too much until I confuse myself. kevin doesn’t have to  study and aces every test. no fair. well looks like my time is up. if anyone  actually read this, sorry. fun job huh. I guess you’ve read much weirder  stuff than this anyway. well adios. 
__label__label0 today if the first Sunday that I have been here alone and it is interesting because I don’t have my parents looking over my shoulder telling me what to do. I can just walk out of my room and go have a cigarette. this is different because before I would have to think up an excuse to go and have one. my feet are cold right now and I need to take a shower. I didn't get up till about 00:00. the ORGNAME music video awards and not very exciting and I am tired of listening to all of these peoples memories about their favorite moments. they, the awards are just a simple kind of propaganda. PROPNAME PROPNAME does like little boys and should stop trying to cover it up with all those insignificant women. the only reason he wants children are for the obvious. it sucks he has that kind of problem. many people do like to eat corn but they don’t seem to serve it here in the jester cafeteria. I wonder if this is going to get through because I cant even send my mom an email. it would suck if it didn't. this is the largest class I have ever been in. I hope it is the most interesting. I need to check how much money is in my account. I came with alot and am still wondering how much I will leave with. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a funny guy and I figure he had a bad childhood because his brother is a bearded man who rarely says a word. I miss running track. I need to go and workout but will when I’m done. PROPNAME is the most ridiculous group in the whole world. if they can make it I know that I can. I am really infatuated with this girl and hope that I run into her again, actually there are two that I am. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a pimp. I cant believe that princess PROPNAME died. I think that she staged her own death to get away from the photographers. she had been harassed her whole life and would have and could have been driven to such extremes. I do not know how long I've been writing but will keep writing for another ten minutes. I feel like Beavis and butthead because I am verbalizing all of my thoughts. I stayed up till three o’clock last night and still slept nine hours. the song by PROPNAME, dude look like a lady, is it about a homosexual or a crossdresser. is cross dresser one or two words. I still think that notorious b. i. g. and tupac are still alive. I need to get the c. d. tom petty and the heart breakers greatest hits because I miss listening to them. I still seems I haven’t written that much. van halen is so cool, not. this is ridiculous my thoughts. Daisy fuentes is hot and I’m glad that she is not bald. what is PROPNAME masons deal ?>????. he is a freak and I had the pleasure of meeting him and his band in the theatre. he was busy throwing gummy worms at the people attempting to watch star wars. he reminded me of a lost child. maybe that’s why he dresses like he does. he is a freak. the chocolate milk in the cafeteria is good. I kind of want to go to breakfast tomorrow because I have never eaten in the morning in the cafeteria. I have done absolutely nothing today and I thoroughly like it. I do need to go and take a shower because that would be proper. I wonder how many people only take showers every other day. I wonder if commercials actually do influence the ways people buy products. that's it has been twenty minutes. 
__label__label0 pennebaker I used to think it was spelled pennebaker and I couldn’t logon to the web page cause I kept spelling it wrong, silly me. but that’s the story of my life I guess, one time, I thought I was going to psy class, but I had the day wrong, and I ended up going to a chemistry class!! and I said to the guy next to me, "is that the usual guy who teaches?" and he goes, "yeah" duh. and my eyes are pretty bad and so I was like, okay. and then well, he started talking about chemistry, and that's when I realized that I had the wrong day and was in the wrong class. but I was such a nincompoop, for some reason, I just didn't want to leave the class, maybe it was the really hot girl who sat down next to me, yeah, I guess it was probably her, but anyway I ended up staying in there and finding the class very interesting, and so I wouldn't look like a freshman, which of course I am, I started to take notes. you know, I won't keep them or anything, but I couldn't just sit there while this guy was giving this awesome lecture and not take notes!!! especially when that girl next to me was taking notes so fast like. but there's too many girls are this school. I mean, wait, I mean, too many girls who think they're pretty and try to hard. maybe there's too many guys in the same class, I wouldn't know. but like, I find it amazing. I mean, of course, in highschool, they're were girl who tried so hard to impress everyone and make themselves so beautiful, and all us guys were like the ones who try the hardest are the ones who fail the hardest!!! fail meaning don't do a good job of making them selves look good. I don't know, I just always preferred the beautiful ones who didn't have to paste on the makeup on for hours every morning. sometimes, I would and still wonder how long it takes a particular girl to get ready to go to a college class. it looks like it takes them FOREVER! it's amazing, I just get up, take a shower, do the person hygiene things that everyone does, put some clothes on, and go. I don't know. maybe I should spend more time getting myself prettier. I just find it disgusting, that's all. and one time, one of my friend sent me this email with the most awful, brutal, disgusting pictures I’ve ver seen. I was so depressed for like days after I saw them. I don't know what they were of, I mean, if it was a war or what not. but it was these pictures of people who were dead, and they way the died, it was just horrid. I mean, I’ve seen some nasty deadly pictures of hanging and shooting people and everything, but these were just simply horrid. and I never get sad or depressed these days, at least not any more. I used to be though. and get this, it was cause of a girl that I was so depressed!! can you believe that!? I was going out with her, right, and it was all good, and then one day she said not any more, and I couldn't believe it. it was such a shock, I was amazed, and therefore depressed for like, well, for months, probably around 0 months were I felt that I was leading two separate lives!! it was horrible. and you know, with things like that, the only thing that helps is time. lots of it. I guess that’s what my uncle is going through. uuhh, lemme see, I think it was probably about 0 months ago, maybe more, maybe less, my cousin was at a party where many illegal substances were being used, cocaine, speed, you know, those terrible drugs. he ended up getting in to a fight over the use of a telephone with some African American male (my cousin and I are Hispanics, well, I’m just half Hispanic and half white, but he was pure blood) and they got into a fight, and the African American guy ended up stabbing my cousin and killing him. it was instant or anything, my cousin was a really big guy. strong and big and everything. he had a wife and a daughter. she's so beautiful. she had no idea what was going on at her fathers funeral. I mean, she's old enough to walk and talk and stuff like that, but she was clueless. and so I was I for that matter. she probably understood it more than I I did the more I think about it. his funeral was so so, well, the most beautiful and sad thing I’ve ever seen in my life. that's what my mom said about princess PROPNAME’s death, but it pertains to this as well, at least for me. we buried him. in a cemetery, next to some family members. he was 00. it wasn't his time. it wasn't his place. but, God has a reason for everything, you know. I wonder if I’m just writing this out and nobody is going to read this, and I wonder if and when you, if there is a you, reads this, when that will be. it's 0:00 p. m. Wednesday, august 00th, 0000. I miss him. another really close friend of mine died of cancer on march 00, 0000. but we won't go there, things just kind ad up you know? Anyway, did you know that right now and for the past 0 decades LOCNAME has been the farthest planet from our sun!? did you know that!? I didn't! I was amazing, my thumb is really hurrying from hitting the space bat so darn often. I miss my cousin. I didn't know him well enough. my other cousin, all the full blood ones, the true ones, they took it a lot harder that I did. they were into to things like that, and it was like a wake up call for them. for me, it was a wake up call that I don’t' think I’m ever going to pick up. it's like it hasn't really happened, STILL. after all this time, I STILL hasn't really happened!!! is that amazing? talk about denial. but it's more than just denial for me, I mean I truly still don't think it's hit home yet. it s just one of those things you read about, see on T. V. it's not something that happens to your cousin. my cousin was murdered. my cousin was murdered. can't believe that, saying that, my cousin was murdered!? is it true? was he murdered seriously!? can that be, is it possible!? is that SO!? IS THAT SO!? I PRAY TO GOD THAT THE PERSON WHO KILLED HIM REALIZES HIS SINS IN JAIL, FOR THE NEXT 00 YEARS AT LEAST WITHOUT BAIL, AND I PRAY TO GOD HE REPENTS FOR HIS SINS, AND I PRAY TO GOD THAT GOD FORGIVES HIM, CAUSE LORD KNOWS I NEVER WILL     in memory of PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label0 Today. Had to turn the music down. Today I went to the KVRX meeting. I  will hopefully have my own radio show. I don’t know what I will talk about. I have considered in great depth and. Jeez this songs starts off quietly. cool beginning. should start louder. oh well can't all be perfect. My roommate is playing the same game . he plays that game too much and spends too much time with it. does he get homework?  I just don't know. This song is rather erotic. in a very deep and disturbing way. I can't decide whether I actually want to study medical technology or not. I love many things form chemistry to mycology to religious studies/. speaking  of which I had a very good time at my PSA meeting. PROPNAME student alliance. ahh. gotta love that screech the chairs let when you push them back. ahhhhh. well. oh yeah at the meeting I met several people. PROPNAME seems rather worried about one of the women. though he is bound and like wise I am unable  to speak ill of her. Well I am in charge of running our booth Monday. or is it Tuesday. That song is one again. his team (my roommate) I s winning. YEESH. Well I guess if he enjoys it. my typing is rather poor and this assignment is taking a long time. 00 minutes. been 0. . lalalalalalalal. Yes the meeting. I talked about shamanism. which apparently comes from a Siberian word. being that there are several hundred different shamanic following in this world. due to the vast number of tribes that speckle our world. PROPNAME PROPNAME has a very sexy voice. I would love to make love to this song,. Well. too much. info. /. Dtos are fun ellipses. that word too is fun. I think that perhaps I am slowly running out of things to say. . That song reminds me of my young age. riding in the car and talking to my  family. the streetlights were bright back then and things were happy. or where they. perhaps not,, I don't remember that well. My car was full of all of us and the  dog wasn't around. She isn't anymore either. epilepsy has taken her from this incarnation. I wonder what she is  doing now. Does she know that I miss her???? I  wish I could find out. Possibly clairvoyance. That is of course under the assumption that spirits are all equal. they are. I know. For I am. Yes I was and shall be. ever. My childhood bears a interesting mark of past fuzziness. I can't seem to recollect exact details like others. very brown. ,. fuzzy is the best word. The 00's really did suck. I wonder why that CD is still lying there on the answering machine. I love bright circling colors. they interest me. not in a psychotic manner but in a very hypnotic manner. they calm. I like to be calm and sedate/. Though activity on occasion is good. . . . PROPNAME is not a good color. neutral  yes but very passive. though passive is good. LOCNAME. there's a philosophy. They believe that by doing nothing they do everything. interesting. I am currently reading PROPNAME PROPNAME His hermetic order seems rather interesting though a bit on the abnormal and almost eccentric side. I remember reading stories about spiders. And milkmen in fields with roses. no daisies. yeah daisies. Looking down upon the daisies as they look up to me. I want to do a past life regression and find out who I was. I wonder if I have been anyone famous or popular. Wow I am saying some rather strange things. interesting. I didn't. . My head hurts. and my room is hot. I would like to stop this. I have 0 minutes left and nothing to say except for watching my fingers press the buttons is a rather enjoyable activity. they press slowly and heavy. sometimes fast and lithe. I mean light. yeah light. so I hope I am doing this right. I am putting my consciousness on record for others to read. I guess that's cool. It should be interesting though I have said very little. I wonder what other are saying. ahh the three minutes have passed and my typing ill now slow to a halt. 
__label__label0 At the moment I’m sitting in my room enjoying a 00 oz. slurpee. A cherry and coke mix, which is my favorite. I have been relaxing after another crummy cafeteria meal thinking about the days occurrences. Tuesdays and Thursdays are rough because I have to go to class all day. Classes aren't really that bad but they seem to put a large strain on  the mind making a body feel worn out. The course load for me this year is tuff and it seems that I have little free time left. This is a very strange assignment in my mind. I can't see what y’all can get from hearing me ramble on about nothing, but if it helps then I guess its worth it. Chapter two in the Psy. book is very interesting in fact I have found the  course to be interesting. To bad it comes after an hour and a half of chemistry and the most boring class I have ever been in. The selection of girls in the class isn't bad either. So an interesting class combined with good looking scenery is a big plus in my book. Whoa brain freeze. damn I hate those. Well after this I have to start on my M 000D homework. Now that is one hard class. That one and Chem 000 are going to be the death of me this semester. It seems like a 00 minute free flow writing assignment seems like it  would be hard, but once you start it just seems to flow, kind of like a good rap song. I really like rap the combination of a good beat and  a master on the microphone to me is really fine music. However, I love oldies too The Beatles, Mommas & the Pappas, The Monkeys, and so on  are really good listening music. Kind of like returning to my roots I guess. Well that was twenty minutes so I’ll shut up now hope this was enough to fulfill your requests.  
__label__label1 I am writing in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. This is my first time using the computers here at the University. I was a little afraid because I did not have my e-mail address yet. But now I do and I am feeling a little better. I still do not know how to e-mail someone yet, but hopefully I will learn. The only people I would e-mail to would be my dad or some assignment I have to do for ORGNAME 000. I am not very good with computers. That is one of my weaknesses. I feel a little out of place here in the computer room because I feel that I am the only person that does not know how to use computers. I guess I will keep asking questions until I finally figure it out. I wish I learned how to use computers earlier in my life, then maybe I would not be at such a disadvantage. Computers could come in real handy. Like for this writing assignment, for instance. In RTF 000, we have to go to the web page and ask questions in a discussion between fellow students. That sounds like a good idea. I am feeling tired today. I got enough sleep last night. I do know what my problem is. It was hard staying awake in  class today. Hopefully  tomorrow will be different. Before I came to the library, I was supposed to go to a SI for RTF. The only problem was that I went to the ORGNAME building instead of the CBA building. That upset me because I was really looking forward to going. There is one tomorrow, but I have Psy during that time. However, I will be going to the Psy SI today from 0-0 p. m. This time, I know where the building is. I think these SI classes are good ideas because it is a follow up to the lecture that students receive in class. So, if I missed something, I could go to the SI and re-learn what I did not understand. Now, there is no excuses for not understanding material. I did an assignment like this one in my typing class last year. It was the same exact prompt:  let your mind flow freely onto the screen. That assignment was only for five minutes though. Right now in the library, there is a long line for the computers. I hate waiting in lines. Today I waited in line to draw football tickets to the ORGNAME vs. ORGNAME game on Saturday. I hope UT wins the football game. I am a big fan of football. In high school I was in band. That means that I got a free ticket to go to every football game. However, our football team was not that good. I think that Psychology will be an interesting class. I like learning about people and the things they do. I am looking forward to an interesting semester. I hope that the class is not too hard. Some questions that come to my mind right now is why do students have to do this writing assignment?  What kind of research is this?  What will this writing assignment tell about students?  I will also be doing the experiments instead of the research paper.  
__label__label1 Today has been the worst and most stressful day ever. All I want is for  something to go right!  I tried to dot his paper about thirty seconds ago but it didn't work because again I've messed something up! I was talking about this in my last stream of consciousness paper that I thought was gone but realized after I had erased half o of it that it was really still there! AAhhh!  Can something please go right?   My Ethernet card was not properly packaged and is causing me and a few others serious drama because we've all been trying to make it work for four days now. I don't even know if I'm supposed to push enter when I get near the end of the line but I figure better safe than sorry as far as grades go. I just looked at the clock and I've only been writing for four minutes. Why does time go  by so slowly when it counts. Speaking of timing, mine is the worst!  I always like guys either before or after they like me but never while they like me. Whenever I like a guy I'm to shy, stupid, scared,  immature to let him know, and by the time or if he likes me I have lost interest!  Or they never have interest in the first place and I find that challenging and will pursue that guy instead  of the  one who likes me!  Or in one case I'll find out that after liking me four two straight years, he decides to change sex preferences when I like him. AHHH!  Actually I had my chance and now I'll have to live with regret forever, or until he wants an opposite sex relationship!  Ten minutes to go and I'm running out of self-deprecating and embarrassing stories of my miserable unromantic life! I want someone who respects the fact that I'm not a traditional female and that likes my odd sense of humor and is also funny himself and finds me attractive. . Which reminds me as I look above my roommate’s computer of another guy who I let slip through the cracks Even though there was a slim chance of anything ever happening, I never acted on my feelings,  Wait a minute I did spill my guts while playing truth or dare with him and other friends. I wish I could play truth or dare with the other guy I like(d) so that he'll know that it was me and not him that kept us ;apart, I liked you then and I liked you up until I found out there was no chance for us and I resented you a little!  Someday I'll get up the courage to tell him!  It is about twenty degrees Fahrenheit in my lovely room in LOCNAME LOCNAME on the tenth floor. The air Conditioning vent is blowing right in my face as I type. I have been having stomach problems all day, and they are starting to resurface,  I almost passed  out at the draw for the football game against ORGNAME this Saturday, I refuse to paint my face half orange and half white as my roommate hopes I will. One minute to go and I'm starting to feel relieved that I wont have to think about this particular assignment ever again. Five percent of my grade is secured and pretty soon I'll be doing those psych experiments and that will be easy too. I'm majoring in psychology but I used to want to be an architect. Oops, I got carried away and wrote one minute over, now it is two. 
__label__label1 Right now I am in my friend's Jester dorm to do my writing 0 with her computer. I will probably do all my writing assignments in her room because all the other computer labs in the LOCNAME LOCNAME campus are always full. It is really annoying when I have to wait to use a computer. I just don't have time to wait, since I have so much homework to do. I feel very nervous and uneasy about all my classes because this is my first year in college. People told me that the method of studying in college is different from high school. I am still not use to living in the dorm. It is too small and just doesn't feel as comfortable as home. I miss my parents, my dog, and the freedom to drive my car out. I am going to work very hard in college in order to have a very successful life. My leg and arm muscles are aching, since I played basketball and worked out at the Rec Center yesterday. I like the facility there. There is a good variety of things to do. I plan to reserve time everyday to play sports, especially basketball and tennis. The Boyz II Men new song called "The Four Seasons" is in my head right now. I enjoy listening to the song. It sounds very sweet and peaceful. The song reminds me of the time when my mom and dad send me off to here at U. T. I am now listening to the movie called "Space Jam. " My sister and my friend are in the room watching the movie. I saw the movie about half a year ago. I thought it was a very cute movie. It is amazing how the creators of the movie can mix animation with real people. My favorite basketball player, PROPNAME PROPNAME, is one of the main characters in the movie. I like to watch him play basketball because he always makes incredible shots. It is so cool when PROPNAME makes a slam dunk. He really does fly a little. I hope tomorrow will be a good day for me. I hope I won't be very nervous when I go into my classes. I have four classes to go to tomorrow! I am really excited about seeing my senior U. T. cousin tomorrow!  
__label__label1 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and I am thrilled!!! to be here at LOCNAME. I've always loved PROPNAME ever since I visited here when I was younger speaking of which I have been feeling like I was a little kid lately because I am in a new place with new people everything is new. Sometimes new is fun like in relationships. new is the best feeling in the whole world until it wears off it is sad and almost laughable how people can get tired of one another. Like my roommate and I are VERY  tired of each other right now. Every little thing she does annoys me and I am sure she feels the same way about some of my habits. I have several annoying ones. My boyfriend says he has not found any, but that leads back to the whole newness thing. He doesn't quite know me. and I'm not quite sure I want him to . I want some ORGNAME's right now because I am starving I haven't eaten since this morning because I have been running all over campus getting things done. I went to a meeting for the Pom squad tryouts and I had a memory rush from high school The chick who is the director is one of my old drill team director's friends and lets just say I don't like to think of drill team much. Although it seems to be on my mind alot lately because I have been questioning weather or not I should be in LOCNAME or not. I am really truly happy for PROPNAME and brooke and PROPNAME, but I can't help but be envious. I know PROPNAME is loving shoving this in my face but I wish she wouldn't Why can't we just be friends again like we were last year all of this other crap had to start and now its finished kind of. I guess not totally finished because I am still stringing Earl along. I don’t  mean to be so selfish but I like having someone there for security. I have always been given security from my parents and I am used to that feeling I miss my parents they do so much for me like my mom getting this new job one that I don't even know if she likes just to make more money so I can go to UT. My sister loves to spend my parents money and I am finding out how easy it is when you're far from home and you don't see the negative effects your money spending is having on them they must really totally love us. I can not even fathom what having a child must be like sometimes I want to have children and get married and settle down and other times I don't want any of that mushy stuff. That is kind of what Earl is there for. Incase I decide to pursue the romantic side in me which I seriously doubt so I should just let him go and I am really bad at typing I used to be better but I guess I am a little out of practice I tool 0 typing classes in high school which I had a nice time in we have such an awesome senior class. I was so proud but now everybody is gone off to do their own thing I can't spell either I have always had that problem ever since I was little my whole family makes fun of me for it especially my sister. I wonder how long I have been typing I haven't typed like this since staying up all night writing and typing my senior research paper on PROPNAME. I love Ms. PROPNAME she was a great teacher I wonder how heather is doing in LOCNAME I should call her tonight and see if she likes her class. It would be awesome to live in LOCNAME the Indigo girls are from LOCNAME LOCNAME and I have always wanted to go there and see their home town I think where people are from say alot about them. like my cousin is from LOCNAME and she a real heavy accent her whole family does I hope she is ok. She went a little crazy after her father died, but who wouldn't my mother is crazy. poor woman is going through so much right now and PROPNAME has to be feeling the same way with both of her daughters moving out at the same time. 
__label__label1 I have been typing friends and family for a while now, and I noticed today that my most creative writing is then!  When I have no worries, no cares, and just let go of all those ideas that I keep losing when it comes to the time when your dreaded English class requires a ten page paper. < and I'm wondering why this line will not stop, this page must be really long!  Wow, or the typing very small.  (Deep breath), the guy next to me just passed out onto his keyboard but- up(!) he's okay. Back to the computer idea. I believe that sometimes computers get mad at me for figuring them out, so they crap out completely. Just simply have no cure at all. The one story I want to tell is short and sweet, but a little scary. IT is the reason why I thought I'd never use a computer again, but I went against my promises, and forced myself to join this growing, technological world once again. This is really difficult. I wasn't going to write this in the LAB, but I have a large space of time between my two classes today, a four-hour space. Which is good, I do believe. I think that there are some people at the LABs who are a little too curious about what is being written on computers next to them. Ya know, "I wonder what other people are up to?"  I admit that I've looked at a few words typed up on someone else's screen, but not as rudely as the guy who is sitting next to me. Possibly, if I tell him straight out, he'll stop, but, nope, I'm a little too shy for that. I think he'll catch on if he reads this. GET A LIFE! no, that is a little cruel. I actually have changed my mind. You can read my screen if you want.  I changed my mind after I saw the movie "DREAM WITH THE FISHES" very good movie. It won't be out on the screen by the time you read this I don't think. I may actually be gone by then too. I wonder. How can you stand reading -actually, I changed my mind. I'd enjoy reading people's true odd thoughts. But I like to put a visual subject to their writing, I like to know what their appearance is. I ask myself, is that wrong to want to know what that person looks like?  I really don't give a shit about what I look like once I'm out in public, but -I got off the whole point-  Some people's beliefs have to be proven by their actions, and sometimes their actions will be expressed through the appearance. These are such strong words that can honestly screw someone over; especially if they are into politics.  What the hell, I need to read back and see what I was aiming for. Oh, the guy who likes to read the screen, and the movie (!) it's time to compare and contrast. In "Dream with the Fishes", one of the two main characters, the one who's point of view is taken throughout the movie, he is a very simple, depressed, and desperate, business man. His favorite pastime (which the second character made him admit to him) was looking at people through his binoculars, through the city windows, across to the apartment buildings. This is a really good movie, I suggest seeing it. Okay, I'm going scatter again. Well, the second character knew all along that the business man watched him, but didn't mind. He knew that it was all the business man had, so he let him. This was not the main portion of the movie or anything, it's not that dull, it was just a simple twist to make the movie a little more unique. That brings me to another point, why must people spend so much time making movies which resemble fifty other movies?  Maybe a hundred or more?  I don't even bother to go to the ones with same plots, or no plots. But I AM a movie freak!  I might even want to get into that someday. I'll have to improve on my grammar a bit, and get used to being in the dark a lot, with fictional, or replayed stories being projected in front of me. I COULD do that. But I think my interests will take their own path, according to availability. Oh!  I just remembered that I need to get some toothpaste, and possibly some other stuff, but being a typical college student, I think I can only afford toothpaste. I HAVE noticed around here that these kids around me are very rich actually. (with a sly movement of the eyebrow)  What's up with that?  This is supposed to be real life right?  Well, another form of real life just growled at me, I'm starving, and must go. Thank you very much if you read this. You know a few secrets which I would tell no one. Well, not real individual secrets, just train of thought that I would never admit to someone else. And although you have my name, it's no matter cause I don't know who you are. See ya 
__label__label0 ok, I guess I really don't know where to start. I just got out ORGNAME my BA000 class, which was possibly the single most boring experience thus so far since classes began. I guess maybe I should have stayed longer, but there were so many freshman around me with their eyes so wide open, and trying to make friends with everyone around them, that I couldn't stand it for very much longer. this screen is really bothering me because it seems as though I’m writing all of this on one very long  line, I'm wondering if there is some way I can go about fixing it after this is all over, because it is really annoying and it seems as though I'm not writing anything. I don't know what I'm going to do tonight, it's too late to call my boyfriend, he lives overseas, and there is a seven hour time change. I hope everything is going well with him, because he is going into his obligatory military service soon and he is really nervous about it. If only I was still in LOCNAME that way I would know that everything was going well with him. this is a really huge box that I'm writing in because the wrap around just came into affect. very strange, very very strange. I guess I'm at a point where I don't exactly know what to write about because my mind is kind of going blank. My friend once told me that he never stops thinking, that at all times he is thinking about something, and when you are talking to him, that he may or may not be thinking about the subject that you are talking about with him. that worries me, because sometimes I see I’m smile for no apparent reason when we are talking, and I just know that the last thirty words that I have just said, he is paying absolutely no attention to. my friends are kind of strange in that they are all in their own little worlds, that's not saying that I'm not. But my little world seems a little bit more down to earth then the ones that my friends are living in. Maybe that's why I'm taking psych instead of sociology, it's because I’m trying to figure out who these people are and why I chose them as my friends. It could be an extension off this whole existential kick hat I've recently gotten into. My boyfriend is really into existentialism, and so the only thing I've been reading as of late has been PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But then of course I must be honest, I'm taking this course because it is located close to my other class on Tuesday Thursday, and it is at a convenient time relative to that class as well. Not to mention my friends who have taken soc, told me it was echelons more boring than this class was to take. I  hope I get a good grade in this class, after this last semester, my grades are suffering, I literally dropped my ORGNAME by . 0 over this last summer semester, which should indicate that I really didn't do very well. But I only have 00 hours, so if I do well this semester, I can bring my GPA back up over 0. 0 and maybe my parents will start being nice to me again. It's not like they aren't nice now, but they are "really disappointed how I handled last semester"  that is "considering that we sent you to LOCNAME last you, you could at least try a little harder"  this would all be said in the PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME low god-like voice that I always get in my head whenever my Dad is yelling at me. I probably get that in my head, because my Dad yelling at me reminds me of PROPNAME PROPNAME when he's mad at the corporals, and PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is the voice of Darth Vader, do you see the connection?  Anyway, so I'm trying to make my grades appear somewhat better, because if I do, they  will probably let me go on the intensive French study program I want to go to next summer. and then I can see my boyfriend he is so cute. I miss him a lot. I tend to think about him most when I'm either lonely or bored in class. That only either maker me more distracted from the work I should be doing, or even sadder about being all alone. If only he could be American, my life would be so much simpler. Have I been writing for twenty minutes yet, I swear I've been writing for decades, and my hands are starting to get lazy, and tired, and I really don't want all these people around me in the computer room, and I wish that I had had the time to take a shower this morning, because I think all day in the sun has really made me start to smell. I have to have been writing for over twenty minutes now, because the people at the workstations around me have already started leaving, granted they were here before I even started this little assignment, into the mind of the student at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. I'm starting to think I'm going to end this pretty soon, because that is the only thing I can think of right now, is when am I going to end this assignment. I think this would probably be a good time because this is starting to redundant. But you said that it didn't matter what we said as long a s we did the assignment and wrote for twenty minutes. so here I am my twenty minutes complete, and I am saying good bye and thank god this is over. only one more to go.   
__label__label0 just sitting here trying to avoid the whole problem of procrastination and hoping that perhaps I can get all of this done and start off the year right. I don’t know anymore about really anything and I sometimes think that I need a change in my life, like college isn't a big enough change in and of itself. The whole problem is that I need to keep doing well so that maybe I can transfer my credits. I want to go to LOCNAME so bad and yet I have to do this in order to do that . God I wish that I could easily keep my room mate off of my computer and away from my shit. I bugs the hell out of me to have my email folder full of the useless crap from his anyone can pass classes. Like the morons in there with him really don't have anything better to do that waste their professor’s time and energy by having him spoon-feed higher education to these bastards with a sugar coating. It would just be easier if they were all herded together into a large barn and taught the ORGNAME's all over again, then maybe it would make more sense to them. Maybe I’m just still adjusting to a new environment, of maybe I really do have as much vile contempt for may of the people around me as I think I do. I hope not, that could really hammer my ability to become what I want have if I end up hating three quarters of the general populous. Maybe I just need a stiff drink and a nap. Yes, it is time to stock the fridge. But what to buy, I know that the whole beer issue is a mute point and that no matter what I buy my room mate will drink it, maybe he won't be interested in the wine or schnapps or Vodka, I would really like to get a nice brandy. I just am concerned because he had little or no moral problem with eating the very expensive cheese I got at central market and so he might drink some very expensive wine all n the name  of culturing himself. That would really suck. I wish I had brought that bottle of nitrogen from home. not that  expect to be leaving wine sitting out that long but it is nice to have in any case. That reminds me, I need to subscribe to the wine connoisseur catalog. they have some really bad ass stuff that would make great gifts for my drinking buddies. Maybe a few brandy pipes for PROPNAME, a carafe for PROPNAME, some glasses for PROPNAME and a bottle opener for clay. It really pisses me off how much of a pussy clay is for not coming this semester. "oh no, I have emotional problems and might have a difficult time making the transition". Like he's the only one who has problems and a difficult time making the transition. Get real and grow up. We are all still here and trying to do our best and cope all at the same time, but it is just too much for that spoiled son of a bitch. Literally, his mother is a bitch and the liberal psychobabbeling root of most of the poor kids problems. 
__label__label0 Okay, I just started writing or well I guess typing. I am still kind of emotionless because I just woke up. You know how when you first wake up and you just need to go to the bathroom but after that you don't know what to do. I'm not hungry or thirsty or anything. I am kind of cold though, because the fan is right over my head. I have a pretty good feeling because I got to this page alot easier than I thought I would. Right now the only thing I really think about is a situation I am in. I am dating this guy and he's really great, but he keeps asking where our relationship is going and I don't really know. The big problem is that this guy I dated off and on for over a year is about to be transferred (he's in the ORGNAME) to PROPNAME which is pretty close to here and he calls and writes but never asks if I am seeing anyone new. I don't know if this is because he doesn't care and just wants to be friends or if he just assumes that I am waiting for him. Knowing him he will probably expect me to drop anyone I happen to be involved with as soon as he moves down here. This is something I normally would not mind doing, but I really like this guy I am dating so I don't know what to do. My bathroom is making the weirdest noise right now. I probably need to have that checked out. I am having to shift positions right now because I am not very comfortable and my neck is starting to hurt. Now my nose itches so I have to rub it. My room is a huge mess because they just set up my computer and won't let me throw away any of the boxes so they are piled up in my room until I have the chance to take them home. My hands are starting to shake a little so I must be getting hungry. My roommate should be getting back from class pretty soon and maybe she will make me something to eat. I kind of don't like it when she is in the kitchen though because she tends to make a pretty large mess and it tends to take her a few days to clean it up. You can't really say anything to her because she gets real defensive and it starts a fight. I really miss my cat, PROPNAME PROPNAME, I have had her since I was two and she is BEAUTIFUL!!!  I think my twenty minutes are about up and I am really hungry, so I'm going to end this. BYE!!   
__label__label0 This is one of the most interesting assignments to date in my educational career. Never before have I submitted my work over the computer. I pretty much knew what  I was going to write about when I got down here. my ex-girlfriend. She brings out a lot of sensations and feelings, and I can say most have been pleasant, but not lately. The guy next to me seems pretty cool. Some guy just sat down by me. looked like he was lost or maybe self-conscious because he didn't sit long. I guess this place isn't so bad. I've got a hangover. which isn't too bad, considering me excessive intoxication the night before. What a bitch. People type too damn loud!! The guy running this place seems somewhat dorkey. may that be an understatement. PROPNAME will be happy to know that I am finally going to break it off with her. It's what he wanted, and I too, but I couldn't do it myself. she's too damn manipulating and she's a bad, bad person. Who the hell is she to think that I'll always be here to pick her ass off the ground like some sort of surrogate mother. Last time I checked I don't have any breasts to breast-feed her. But I'll tell you who does. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME (also known as val on 00000). They can't be real, say the girls I was watching the show with. what makes them experts on breasts, maybe the fact that they've had them for a long time. But every damn time a girl seems some guy with a ripped ass body they never take in to consideration that that shit could very well be fake, too. I wonder what that loud noise was. I think I curse to damn much. oh well. Yes that would be a cute chick next to me. but she doesn't look all that good. I don't see  any fine girls in here. people talk too much. there are a lot of fine girls here but not as many as were anticipated. now sixth street is where you'll find a lot of honnies. Sixth street is where you'll find a lot of stuff, that's where I got my tattoo, which everyone has said they liked it except the artist(known as forest) who tattooed it on my back. Probably because there's too much detail and his lazy  ass didn't want to do it all. I've got four more minutes left to this assignment  and some guy just dropped his calculator. dumbass. I'm thirsty . und ein bischen hungry, that was a little German for those wondering(hope I spelled it right). It's odd as soon as we see someone or meet someone we immediately pass judgment on  them, we don't know these people but we judge them one first impressions. which can be positive or bad. my first impressions come off better when I've had a little  to drink, not that my sober impressions come off as bad, I can always entertain  people better when I've had a little to drink. . gotta go 
__label__label1 It's 0:00 and I am beginning this assignment. It's an interesting one. You never really pay attention to how your mind jumps from one thing to another, at least I don't. My roommate just came in. She thinks I am mad at her and I am a little. I'm always waiting on her and it's annoying. I hadn't eaten anything all day and I was about to go to the cafeteria and she wanted me to wait for her . Thirty minutes later we start walking to the cafeteria and she decides she's not hungry. I had waited for nothing. We get along very well, but I don't think she realizes what she does. She keeps interrupting me while I'm writing this and it's timed. She got mad at me just now because I asked her to be quiet. She left the door open and there's someone playing their music pretty loudly. I really don't like the girls next door. We get along with the girls who live a couple of doors down very well. The one's next door just aren't very friendly. My roommate heard one of the girls slamming stuff around and griping because I was playing PROPNAME PROPNAME. One of them is in choir and she's always doing voice exercises. I hope my roommate doesn't start acting like I'm mad at her or vice-versa. She's on the phone. Her guy problems are pretty entertaining. I try to help her out, but I really can't empathize with her. She has a completely different approach and understanding with the opposite sex. PROPNAME is going back to PROPNAME tonight. He's one of my friends from home. I've known him since kindergarten. I've also been infatuated with him since kindergarten. Maybe he'll decide he likes me too. I doubt it though. That's a depressing thought. Oh well. There are plenty of other guys around here. In PROPNAME there were not even close to as many. Population:0,000. Graduating class: 000. That's why I came here. I wanted to be in a place with many other people. I have definitely found that place. A lot of people from PROPNAME thought I was crazy for wanting to come here. I guess different people want different things. it makes sense. One of our friends from down the hall just came in. She's very cool. She's going to let me use her computer to type this, which is sweet of her. It's very beneficial to know people. Everyone has something to offer. Of course, you have to give also. Some are better at that than others. I know I’ve given plenty of cigarettes. Hopefully I've contributed more than just that. I've offered advice, which of course I always thought was good advice. I've tried to be friendly. I've given complements. I've loaned money and shared food. PROPNAME PROPNAME , I've done my part so far. I think school is going to go well. I just can't let people take advantage of me like I have in the past. I think I can manage the academic  part pretty well. The only thing that is difficult so far is Calculus and that was to be expected. I've been doing my best though, and that's all I can do. 
__label__label0 I'm feeling a little tired right now. I usually don't suffer from severe lack of sleep as I have this weekend. It's pretty interesting the way it affects my ability to concentrate. I feel like I don't read as well or  communicate ideas as well. This is really a weird assignment but I feel  like I would be taking the easy way out if I were to sit here and dwell  on that for twenty minutes so here goes. Someone is tapping on a table  or something in the next room. I hate it when people make a big ruckus  doing something like that and then they can't even keep a beat. Something I think is interesting is the way people can become dependent on new  technology in a matter of months. When my roommate and I first moved here to LOCNAME we didn't have e-mail capabilities at first and I felt  completely cut off from the outside world. I was so relieved when we  were finally back online. I just figured out what that tapping was. It's  my roommate playing electric bass but it's not plugged in so there isn't  much pitch distinction. Like I always say: bass should be felt not heard. Speaking of my roommate, everyone has told me that it's a bad idea to live  with a friend at college and I think they were right. It's not that I don't like the guy. It's just that his annoying traits got magnified tenfold as  soon as we moved into a 00 foot by 0 foot room. Some friends came down from my hometown this weekend. Their visit made me  realize that as soon as I left for college, everything changed. Most of my relationships with people have been faded a little by the move and I'm sure it's an ongoing process. There are a couple of people, however that I actually feel closer too and surprisingly they're not here in LOCNAME with me. I'm still trying to understand that. I guess when you're separated  from people by large distances, you kind of sort things out in your head and figure out who and what is important. It's like post traumatic  prioritizing. Ok, I think I've said what needed (or didn't need) to be said. 
__label__label1 The first thing that comes to my mind is how unbelievably long the web address is to this web page. My gawd!  Now I am wondering if this text box has automatic text wrap-around, because, so far, everything is on one line. Oh, I guess I will have to do it manually, and hit return after every line. Now my roommate PROPNAME is berating me for not knowing how to format this text. Maybe if I ignore him for long enough, he will go away. My glance has caught the sight of the Daily Texan. What a lousy newspaper. It is really short, and the best-written articles are from the ORGNAME ORGNAME. That's really pitiful, because the ORGNAME ORGNAME writes the most boring, dry articles on the face of the planet. But that is better than the grammatically incorrect and content-devoid writing of the staff writers. I see that they (ah, the non-descript "they") have created a virus that destroys the AIDS virus in at least some instances. Supposedly, this new virus has worked in the testtubes, but they will not test the virus on animals until next month. That brings up the issue of testing on animals. I have mixed feelings about the issue. If only the animals were voluntary to (almost certainly) die, then it would be different. And if the animal testing ultimately leads to the eradication of a disease or virus, then, of course, it is worth it. But that doesn't make it any easier to do such a terrible thing to an animal. I saw a Twenty-Twenty about these apes who had been tested on and then were taught to talk. They were so intelligent, and so smart. They were depressed, and so sad. Poor babies. Why do I call them babies?  Because that implies that they are poor and innocent. I hate the "dart" board in our dorm room. It is not a true dart board, but one of those Velcro kind with the plastic balls that never stick. "Bulls-eye!  Oh, dang it, it fell off. Never mind. "  That is quite typical. I hate studying!  The thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. I hate to puke!  Just kidding. It's just that I have gotten a little behind in my reading for both astronomy and psychology, so now I am having to read last week's chapters just to get to this weeks. Needless to say, I could use some improvement in my study habits. And the astronomy is so dry!  What up with that, G-dawg in da' house?  You ask any G-dawg, and that dawg will agree straight-up, you know what I'm sayin', fool?  School tomorrow!  I don't even want to think about it, so I won't. Church went well today. I played pretty well, with the exception of jumping the gun on the opening hymn in the 0:00 service today, altogether skipping the call to worship. Oops!  Thank god my salary is not based on number of mistakes. No, actually, I usually do well, and, that mistake notwithstanding, that held true today. I must say, though, the sermon was pretty boring. Especially since I had to hear three sermons. Two is my limit, and three is just too much. Now I am singing in my head. I cannot stopping "playing" in my head the new version of "Candle in the Wind" that PROPNAME PROPNAME wrote for Princess Di's funeral. "It seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never fading in the sunset when the rains set in. "  I believe it has been twenty minutes, so I'm OUTTA HERE! 
__label__label1 I'm sitting here typing again I’ve got a lot to do today I want to get all of my work done soon so I don't have to worry about anything this weekend but I probably will anyway cause I always do. I wish I was a speed reader like on this movie I once saw -my stepmother’s an alien- where the alien just stuck her arm in a book and in a matter of minutes she understood the entire content. if I could do that I would have so much free time to write and draw and relax . I’m sure though that there are people who read slower than me. so maybe I should feel lucky. my wrists hurt again. and my head hurts kind of dizzy tiredness that I have to day from of course not sleeping enough last night. was on the phone instead because some times- especially when your tired and missing your friends- it feels like the right decision to sacrifice sleep for conversational anecdotes. but in the morning and now I feel it may have been a mistake I’ll feel better tomorrow. after I sleep it will be nice to see PROPNAME tomorrow. PROPNAME is so funny -all the porn off his computer sticks in my head its so plastic- I wonder if anyone a long time a go ever thought that sex would be reduced to a computer graphic. its an ironic opposite maybe people are slowly changing- they are- to be more electronically oriented- I wont be one of them though I will stand alone. Mr. purdy too, he always talked about how overindustrialized the world has become and how it will eventually change back like in a cycle to the way it used to be- primitive. but I think his optimism is held up by a false sense of security most likely brought about by his memories as a child of a life with out computers . me on the other hand, they've surrounded me since birth so I cant see his 'cycle' but still I think its more morally correct to not get so swept up in industry - it only aids to the separate ness that everyone in our generation feels the nowhereness, and island like mentality- dad told me when I was little that every one is like an iceberg floating in a vast ocean and from the air you only see these little pieces floating so far away from each other, but beneath the surface, in our subconsciousness, we are all made up of the same water that connects us that we are surrounded by. so we aren’t really all alone were all created from the same stuff. I probably sound like a televangelist but I shouldn’t care what you think of me anyway. I wish I could just cuddle up with PROPNAME under heavy covers-warmth- and just feel his arm and shoulder under my neck and feel the ebb and flow of his breath on my forehead and slip away to sleep I love waking up next to him so warm - it doesn’t even matter if we get married - I've thought about it sometimes. its what's now that’s important and I love him and we’re happy if we ever do get married in a million years it will be because that will make us happy then ,whenever then becomes now. 
__label__label0 as I begin this assignment its seems weird to me that I am in college  and I locating my professor on the computer I don't have to be in the room  to hand you an assignment I have to get up early for class tomorrow usually I'm in bed by now I don't know why I up, I seem to have this spurt of energy tonight I've gotten so much done tonight though I so stressed out this week but today I realize that I've been stressing over future stuff and I was looking at the wrong dates on my syllabus oops forgot to hit the return button typing is making me so much more tired  tonight when I'm done I will go to bed I love waking up in the morning its such a fresh beginning feeling forgot that stupid button again next door the music just got turned on real loud they better cut it out by the time I'm ready for bed I wish PROPNAME were here to go to bed with me LOCNAME is  so far away at 0 in the morning, not that its any closer at 0 in the afternoon but things are so much more in perspective at that time wow I bet this is really  improving my typing skills, not that they are bad I had that typing class in 0th  my back hurts this position hurts but in 0th grade that teacher what was her name. . . oh yeah Mrs. reader and she had that annoying voice. aaaaaaa now class . bbbbbbb is everyone understanding how to switch the fingers to the right letters? this class psych reminds me of my mom she is a therapist I like hearing her talk about that kind of stuff but I don't like when she uses her therapy shit on me anyway I miss her I hope her business trip is going well LOCNAME seems far away at one in the morning I  wonder why I typed that 0 out and just pushed the one key for the last one? anyhow or anywho I can not stand that . anywho! I am not capitalizing my I's anymore cause I’m tired and you said we didn't have to worry about grammar well I have two minutes and to tell you the truth I am now ready to quite and  go to bed. 
__label__label1   Right now I'm thinking how much easier it would be to write assignment  number 0. If there are no right or wrong things to write, I guess I should not worry. I believe I worry too much. It is hard to make this paragraph line up, the ends of each line that is. Right I feel blank but the nice  thing is since I wrote it out, my assignment is not a blank. If all assignments were this easy, I'd worry less. I'm hot, hungry and tired. All a  result of college life I guess. So far, the class has been interesting. I have a feeling the class will get more serious. I generally stay away from computers, technology intimidates me. I like the simple things in life but  the entire world is advancing so I must. For example, I am turning an assignment through the internet. Its pretty crazy to me. My typing is slowing due to an interest in a video that is on and extreme hunger. I be hitting  the submit button now.    
__label__label1 NOTE:  Something happened when I was typing this-the words never skipped down to the next line. (Maybe it's supposed to be that way?!)  Anyway, my thoughts continue to the right-quite a ways. Sorry for the hassle!!   I'm not really sure what this whole assignment is about, but it should be fairly easy for me since I think way too much at times. My thoughts??  I am extremely tired right now. I had a very exhausting weekend and would love to not have classes in the morning. I am doing everything  possible to procrastinate and not begin my huge amount of work. I still haven't really gotten in to the whole college thing. I feel like I am in some kind of dream world-like I it's not really me sitting in a college class with 000 other students. Maybe I was spoiled in high school with classes of only a max of 00 and a graduating class of only 000. Our teachers probably babied us with lots of one-on-one attention-which at the time I loved and appreciated. But NOW I am so overwhelmed!  I'm now only a number out of hundreds of other kids. I guess this whole experience is a big transition no matter what. Anyway, I hope I am doing this correctly. I have no idea why my computer is laying out my words like this. I hate computers!!  We just don’t mix well. I am completely computer illiterate. Sorry if this is taking you longer to read. I am very excited about this psychology class. It happens to be one of my possible majors. Who knows what will happen?!  All I know is that I am a people person and a very good listener that would love to be able to help people in anyway I can. I know it is a tough major with tons of schooling, but it really interests me. I just finished talking to a few of my friends from high school on the phone. They all seem so far away. I miss them and all the fun times we shared. I love reminiscing about our memories, especially looking at old pictures. My walls are full of pictures of friends and family and I'm sure by the end of the year you won't be able to  tell what color the walls are. I miss my family too. 
__label__label0 TOday was an easy day for me since I only had two classes to attend. IN math, I really had a hard time staying awake. I didn’t know if it was because I knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. Either way, I was very tired and at times, I just dozed off. In my ORGNAME class, I had to find information on financial aide. I also had to start a checking account at the credit union. By chance in the corner of my eyes, I could a brochure on financial loans for students. So I picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. Right now I'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on Friday. It's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. I probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. Tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 0 classes to attend. English at 0 in the morning is a killer time for me. I had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. I tries to call TEX many times, but had no luck. Now I have to get used to waking up early every Tuesday and Thursday at about 0:00 in the morning. It's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that I can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 0:00 which is psychology. I really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on Wednesday, I didn't take one and when I attended the class, I had a hard time staying awake. I'm glad that I'm in college now because I feel more independent than at home. My mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. But it gets to a point where I kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which I think is contributed to homesick. I can't wait until thanksgiving when I get to go back and see the family because I really miss my baby brother. I would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. I also miss playing basketball with my 0tenth grade brother. He is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and I hope he makes it. He still thinks he can beat me, but that won’t probably ever be true until I'm about 00 and he's 00. This weekend, I hope to attend the football game with my friends again. I went to the one last week and we blew away ORGNAME by a lot. It was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. A packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment I have ever saw because I have never attended a college football game before. It was quite hot and I was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. I definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. I might even paint my face to show some school spirit. Maybe not. After I finish this assignment, I will have to start working on my English paper which is due next Thursday. I kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before I fully understand the assignment. The good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if I need it. My ORGNAME teacher also mentioned a writing center which I could go to if I have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. I think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. You had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. I guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. The one thing I keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. I may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since ORGNAME's was out of them. Textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. The good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. I think my time is up so that's all I'm going to write. I think I changed the subject like 0 different times but I think that's the purpose of this essay. So, that's all.   
__label__label1 " Stream of Consciousness "  Everyday about now, I am still sleeping. I feel good just having barely six hours of sleep. I thought I would be feeling more tired and exhausted, but It has not hit me yet. This morning, while watching ORGNAME, and still seeing the coverage of Princess PROPNAME, made me sad. It makes me think why everyone in that crash died and the bodyguard did not. He had ten hours of surgery. What pain I thought. I kept on asking myself why did G-d let him live. Why not someone like Princess PROPNAME who did so much for the world and has two young boys to help grow up. She did so much for other people. She even raffled her dresses of for charity. What a women. I'm feeling a little bit tired now. The psy experiment I did today was a fun experiment. I enjoyed it. I sat next to a cute girl. I hope today's classes will go fast. I would like to take a nap today. Just to sleep and rest for an hour. It was nice seeing one of my brothers in my fraternity on campus today. It was a nice surprise. Also, I saw one of my friends from home on campus. It is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see. My mother went on business and I hope she is doing well. I hope she got well rested today. I hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing. I try to put myself in a better mood everyday. I think about a lot of things and it gets me worried. An example is I worry about friends, family, grades, whether I am behind or don't understand something in a class. I also do not like change. I don't like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever. Like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc. I try to get along with all my fraternity brothers, but sometimes I feel it is harder than normal. I spoke with my mother and she says you can't be friends with everyone. I have so much to thank for but I feel that I am always asking G-d to help me in a situation. I enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me. I enjoy school and friends. I feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad. I had a very rough summer due to the fact that I had irritable bowel syndrome. It was very painful and I did not like the pain. A doctor prescribed me some medication. What upsets me is that one of my friends I feel is rude at times. I feel this because last night he was rude when I went to his room and he started yelling that I was disturbing his speech. I continue to be nice to him. I am always debating whether or not to be nice to him. He can be nice at times, but a jerk at other times. I feel that he maybe insecure and have no real friends. Sometimes I'm angry at him and sometimes I'm not. Sometimes I feel sorry for him and sometimes I don't. I walked into my fraternity house this morning and saw our cleaning man. The fraternity buys all his children gifts for Christmas and I think it's nice. Sometimes I feel sorry for him. He is a nice man. I also feel sad sometimes because I wish the relationship with me and my father would be better. I do not get along with him very well. Sometimes I get very upset thinking about it. I often thank G-d that I have an excellent relationship with my mother and my uncle and sister. I miss my dog. He is so cute. I didn't spend that much time with him this summer and forgot to ask my parents how he is doing. Usually I hear him barking when I am on the phone with my parents, but I have not heard him recently. When I visit home in a couple of weekends, I would like to spend a little time with him. He is a very nice and loving pet. He is old but still wild. I hope my girlfriend comes home with me. She said she would. Her father is coming up to LOCNAME on Thursday and we are going to dinner with him. This makes me a little bit nervous, but who wouldn't be ? I think. I miss my family. They are coming up for parents weekend which should be nice. I hope to go to the football game this weekend, some of my friends drew tickets for the game already. I have not given my ID to anyone. I will call up some friends tonight and see if they want to go. Sometimes it is hard to ask my frat bros if they are going etc. Maybe I won't go to the game-- it is a good time to relax. I will see. I hope to watch Melrose Place tonight. I have a lot of homework but I hope to watch it anyway. I have a lot of reading to do and I hope I complete. I think I will or come very close to it. I sometimes do not feel 000 percent. Right now I am getting a little tired. I think I might nap after lunch. I think we are having steak today. I usually think of steak for dinner but I guess it is okay. Yesterday I read for a long time. I didn't get as much reading done as I would of liked, but I am trying to keep up and I understand most of the information in the readings. I have to buckle myself down and get my priorities straight. Maybe I won't go to the game and instead study for my classes. I would get a lot done because no one would be here. I am more tired now. I hope today's classes go fast and I have plenty of time to do work undisturbed!! I hope to see my girlfriend and not argue with her. She is truly my best friend. Guy or Female -- I think she is my best  friend. Another best friend is my friend PROPNAME. He is nice and I have known him since third grade. I am probably going to pray later today. I was hoping to do it this morning but couldn't get myself to wakeup extra early to do so. 
__label__label1 I'm just sitting here thinking while I wait for my clothes to clean. While sitting here I realize how much my life is different in LOCNAME rather than two hundred and eighty miles away in LOCNAME. For example, I always had someone to do my laundry there and if I did it myself I never had to wait for a washing machine. PROPNAMEhe thing I miss most about LOCNAME is not having my friends around. Even though my best friend and my girlfriend are also attending PROPNAME T and both are staying in Jester I still miss my other friends a lot. I always thought when I came to Austin it was going to be so much fun, but now I realize there is a lot of work involved. Only a week has gone by since I got here and I already have so much to do. That is another thing I miss about home, the ability to do nothing if I so desire. Here "doing nothing" is not an option. I feel that if I do nothing I will fall behind and just be wasting time. I miss the little things about home. Even though my girlfriend lives here I miss being able to go to each others house. Sure we can go to each others dorm rooms but I miss the feeling of home and hanging out with her family and mine. That is another thing I have not mentioned yet, I miss my family. I honestly did not think I would but I do. I guess over time I will grow accustomed to living here and maybe eventually be able to call Austin my home. Well, it's time to put the clothes in the dryer so I guess this is the end. 
__label__label0 Here I go. I keep thinking whether or not I am doing this right. I can't seem to spell anything right. I am going to correct all my spelling after I am done. This line just keeps on going. There was just a commercial with people that that said "I am in the woods" and it sounded like the other add that says "I am Tiger Woods". I am so glad the ORGNAME won today. I am not even looking at the screen now, because I was losing my concentration. Only 0 minutes have gone by. I wonder when my roommate will get back. I still don’t know why my phone won't work. This line just keeps on going. It is a little bit hot in here. I am getting tired. I sure am glad I got this chair. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing. I wonder bow many of my friends are in LOCNAME now. I had a dream about PROPNAME again last night. I wonder when I will see her next. I sure wish I could type better. Now it has been 00 minutes. When is PROPNAME going to call. It is 00:00. Time sure does go by faster here. I need to think about all the  things I need to do tomorrow. But I don’t want to. It has almost been 00 minutes. I am anxious to mail my letters. I wonder if I have any mail. I just found food on my shirt. I wish I had something better to eat. I wonder  Oh there showing the tennis highlights now. I am glad that PROPNAME is doing better. I am noticing that I am writing "I wonder" a lot. It is starting to get harder to type now because I am getting tired. I think the twenty minutes are up. I am stopping now. 
__label__label1 I hope I am doing this write!  I never really used the internet before and it took me forever to try and figure out how to log on. I feel better now that I am actually doing this, I thought I wouldn't figure it out in time then I would get a zero and bring my grade down. I am a freshman and I really want to do good. I hope my roommate isn't wandering where I am. We were supposed to do laundry after my class which was your class and ended at0. I was glad it wasn't raining when I got out because I didn't bring my umbrella. I am kind of upset that I couldn't find a smaller one than the huge one I brought. I don't want to look like a dork. I miss my boyfriend he is in LOCNAME LOCNAME where I am from. I wish he would've gotten in to UT like me. It would have been so much fun being here with him without parents always watching over us. My time on this machine expires in ten minutes and it doesn't seem like enough time but it was almost twenty minutes that I have been typing maybe a few minutes less but it took me a while to figure out how to get here anyway. I not a very fast typer so I hope I have written enough and about the write topic that is whatever I am thinking. Well thank god I am almost done I only have one more minute so I have to push the submit button before it cuts me  off. Bye. 
__label__label0 IF I COULD ACTUALLY PLAY IN MAJOR TOURNAMENTS LIKE THE US OPEN, THE FRENCH OPEN, THE AUSTRILIA OPEN, LOCNAME EVEN IF JUST ONE TOURNAMENT, I WILL BE SO GREATFUL. AS I CONTAINUED WATCH THESE PROS PLAY, I PUSH MYSELF IN WORKING MY WAY UP THERE;I PRACTICE AS MUCH AS I CAN,I TRY TO LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN, FROM THEIR MENTAL PART TO THEIR TECHNIQUES; ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I WILL EVER  BECOME AS GOOD AS THEY ARE. YET, I NEVER GIVE UP MY DREAM OF ACTUALLY PLAYING IN ONE OF THE MAJOR TOURNAMENTS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT DREAMS DO COME TRUE IF I WORK HARD FOR IT. IF THIS DREAM NEVER COME TRUE I WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT MYSELF, AT LEAST THERE ARE GREAT MEMORIES LEFT IN ME. THERE ARE OTHER DREAMS AND MISSIONS I HAVE PLANNED TO WORK FOR, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, AND I WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE IN EVERY DREAMS I HAVE AND IN WHATEVER I DO.  
__label__label0 My roommate is trying to ask me what we are going to do while I'm typing this. We played basketball for about two and a half hours. For some reason I played pretty good today, I usually don't play that good. I'm not really sure what to write, well I mean type. I went to a sorority date dash last night. It was pretty fun. They rented out some club on sixth street. I saw some people that I went to highschool with, and I didn't get home until about three so I'm really tired . I really doubt that I'll stay out that late tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to san Antonio for the beastie boys concert with these girls that I don't really know that well. I hope everyone has a good time. The next day is my grandpa's birthday and my entire family is going to meet at our ranch in LOCNAME. That reminds me I have to get him a gift. I'll get him something from ut of course probably a hat or something. My suitemates went home this weekend, one lives in LOCNAME the other lives in deer Park. they are pretty cool guys. Sometimes they get on my nerves but I'm sure I get on people's nerves too. My roommate is going to a church thing right now. He said that the people there are really nice but they are extremist about how they worship, I think it makes him feel uncomfortable, I can relate I've been to some church functions like that. But he is also going because he met some girl there so he is getting the best of both worlds learning about god and hooking up with a girl. I WISH I COULD OF GONE. I can hear my neighbors radio through my wall incase you wanted to know. It kind of makes me want to turn mine on since my time with you is up. 
__label__label1 They are playing OU as I write this and I am hoping that they loose. I keep telling myself to hope that they win but deep down I really want them to loose. When they win his main concern is football and when they loose he concentrates more on me. Is this some psychotic way of wanting to control him?  I know that if they win then he will seem more appealing to other girls. This makes me extremely jealous and insecure. PROPNAME is my first love. He is the first person I ever really cared about. I don't know if I am wasting my time in this long distant relationship though. There are so many more important things that I should be worrying about right now in my life. I am in my prime. I am terrified of getting hurt. I'm scared that I am going to put effort into this relationship only to get screwed over in the end or in a time when I really need him. I can almost see history repeating itself:  in high school I stood beside PROPNAME when he was a dork and always sat the bench in football then when he got good and things took a turn in my life to where I needed someone there for me we was too good. I still have a tremendous amount of anger towards PROPNAME for the things he did to hurt me. This relationship is not good for me right now in many ways but I'm am too scared of loosing the only person in the world that I would be willing to lay down my life for. I don't know if I am being insecure about our relationship because of things PROPNAME has done in the past or because I feel insecure about myself and in some way feel like I am not worthy of someone liking me. 
__label__label1 Last night I was almost done and my computer just shut off. I don't really understand why but oh well. I don't usually understand computer stuff, or any technical stuff in general. I hope that they have my packet today at the co-op so that I can be totally done with mis before tomorrow I think that I am pretty organized in relation to homework more organized than usual at least I think that PROPNAME will be a good academic influence on me since she is a good studier its so much different having a roommate that studies since angie didn't do much last year but it is a good thing may be finally I will get to go to sleep earlier and that will make me healthy I still can't believe that I didn't catch mono from angie last year I have a sore throat now I hope that it goes away soon I don't really want to have to go to the health center you never know when th0ey are going out have to take blood and that really freaks me out I can't believe that it is already time to start school again this summer went by so fast and rush was such a blur and we have had no time to recuperate before jumping back into school this semester is going out be really hard and busy I think I thin k all of my classes will be really interesting, but difficult I am so glad that I was able to get out of art history and into philosophy that will be a lot more interesting it is so weird how some teachers can teacher art history so differently so many people told me that they liked it and that it was easy but I know that that class wouldn't have been easy it was such a pain to add/drop though I am so glad that it is done next weekend is the first football game I am looking forward to it I am glad that billy and I got season tickets so that I don't have to go draw or anything it s so nice to have all of them now and especially the OU tickets I doubt that I will end up going to the a and m game  because I bet I will stay home for thanksgiving well, billy can invite one of this friends to go with him I can't believe that he wouldn't stay home for thanksgiving though that surprises me his mom is going to be very unhappy with him I am getting really hungry I wonder what we will do for dinner I wish that billy and I could get together but we are not on the best terms right now I can't believe that we got in such a big fight last night maybe we were just tired I hope that everything turns out okay it was nice of eric and PROPNAME to come over last night sometimes I miss having all those guys next door like last year we had a lot of fun last year together I am glad that PROPNAME and eric get to be together again, but I hope that they are prepared for what's ahead it will be hard for them to adjust out being together all the time especially when the stress from school really kicks in I am kind of getting a little homesick I am anxious to see PROPNAME's new car I can't believe that she is really turning sixteen I am really afraid for her to drive so I hope that mom and dad are taking her out a lot for a lot of good driving experience she really could use the practice I am anxious to see dads' new office space too I hope that he is a little less stressed I know that going out the party last night was probably pretty hard for him, but I am glad that PROPNAME a. will be available to help him because he needs some new employees I know that mom is getting worried about him being so stressed all the time but I know that she really is glad that he is not going out LOCNAME a lot that was getting really old it was nice to see PROPNAME this weekend it is so weird being I'm the same city as her again I wish tat I could have gotten to see brad too, but he was busy my feelings were kind of hurt how he acted toward me at the party on Wednesday night, but I understand they both still seem pretty immature and I am kind of worried about PROPNAME and I hope that she is careful. I am glad that she found a date for the date dash I can't believe that they are all living on the same hall that is just a little too weird for me but that's pat for you I hope that they all have a fun year and I hope that we all keep in touch it was nice seeing PROPNAME this weekend too her room at the house is really nice I think that her sorority house is really nice also it is really big and it must be nice to have their own bathroom and not have to do the community thing I am glad that PROPNAME and I are going to go on a walk I could really use the exercise I am going to try to start aerobics tomorrow I really need too get back in shape I felt so good about myself last year when I was going to aerobics everyday I need to get back in that mode I don't think that I really lost that much weight this summer but things seem to be fitting better now. I seem to not be snacking as much as I did last year which is a very good thing I hope that the food at the sorority house gets better because it hasn't been very good lately but I think that it will get better I hope that billy calls me after he gets home from work he is working way too hard I guess that he won't work next weekend because he will be at the football game that's a good things maybe we can spend some qt together okay this is getting hard of more things to keep talking about I think that I might be repeating some of the same stuff over and over again I hat it that mom can 't really send packages to the apartment but I'm afraid that I would never get them since there is no real apartment address or anything I'm afraid that they would just leave it outside my door and then something might happen whit it I hope that PROPNAME and PROPNAME had a good time with their boys this weekend I will go down later and see I have a lot of fun with them we are really similar in a lot of ways I am really glad that they are living at centennial too there are so many tridelts here it is a lot of fun I wonder where PROPNAME and I will walk too we need to somehow walk by the coop I hope that it is not too hot outside when I went out onto the balcony a couple minutes ago it was really hot I think that it will be fun to study out there once it gets a little cooler I am anxious for it to cool down it was so hot walking out class the other day especially to the art building I was so disgusting by the time I got back form class Mondays and Wednesdays are going to be long now that I go from one to five but Tuesdays and Thursdays will be pretty easy except this Tuesday I have that class from six to eight o'clock which really stinks I wonder why all the good shows start again I can't wait to see the friends season premier and 00000 I am so excited this year should be very good well I am going to stop this now it is now over 00 minutes   
__label__label1 being new in LOCNAME and on a strange campus with a lot of different people that I've never met, and have no idea what their backgrounds or thoughts may be is weird to me. back home this wasn't the same. All my friends knew me and I knew them. They didn't care about my little flaws. My family was there to support me and care about me. now, I'm hear. alone and people are starting to show their real colors. At first the girls on my floor were accepting and sweet, but now everything has changed. They have this different feelings and thoughts about me. I may have done some things to upset them, just like they have done to me, but I am a forgiving person. I do not hold grudges like others. Which my sister says is a bad trait. guys down my hall, who used to be nice to me, now make fun of he way I talk, the way I dress, just generally me. its hurts a lot. I'm not the kind of person who shares my feelings with others very easily. I try not to let the things they say hurt me, usually they are just joking around. but, it still does hurt. no one likes to be made fun of. Maybe I'm scared of what people think about me. maybe I'm nervous and afraid because I'm in a totally new atmosphere and situation and nearly everyone else has their family and friends nearby, if not living in the rooms with them, the talk to. People who know about their mood swings and personality. but, I don't. At first I didn't think much about all this stuff. I was having a good time in rush and with all the new people I have met. But, things have changes and I kind of wish I had chosen to go to the school where all my home friends went instead of starting anew. but, I guess the reason I'm hear is because I wanted to get away. or at least I thought I wanted to get away. one thing I don't' really like to do is burden people with my problems, especially people I don' know. they usually end up telling me that I should think better about myself or that what I'm thinking isn't right. but, no one really knows what's right for me except me. I tell myself every night that tomorrow I'll try to be a little better at this and try to change that about myself, the things that people get annoyed with so that people will want to be my friend. but, I can't change how I've grown up. my family values have thought me how to be nice to others, but I had to learn on my own how to take it when those people that you think you're the nicest to and like the most can turn on you in a second. that just because you might say a nice thing about someone, that's doesn't mean that the next day they'll remember or even care enough to stop people from hurting you. My mom calls about three times a day. We're pretty close. but, when I was at home she'd annoy me because she always wanted to talk and be around me and I thought I just wanted her to go away. but, no its different. I call her too. I tell her everything that's happened to me that day and ask for advice. I thought I would be that kind of person, but I was wrong. I can't wait to go home and be with people that really know me and accept me right away. I don't' remember the last time I had to work at being someone's friend. I wish I didn't have to write this for so long. I just feel like I'm babbling about the same thing over and over again. I can't type very well either, so some of my words can only be read by dyslexic people. its alright. I'm trying to be as honest and open as possible. A couple of years ago I used to cry everyday. About nothing about something it didn't matter. I was going to go see a psychiatrist. I've never been to one but was always intrigued about what would happen if I went. I think for a little while I'd tell me parents that I HAD to go to one. I convinced them. I dot' know what that was all about. just a phase I guess. I'd still like to go to one. I can't see how someone could like the job of hearing other peoples problems for hors on end everyday. That would be totally crazy. When people tell me their problems I just think about mine and feel bad for myself. I guess I'm self centered or something. I hear people talking in my hall and wish that I could go out there too, but I promised myself that I'd get some work done before I went off to class. I really haven't eaten a lot since I've been here. I skip breakfast don't' eat lunch or dinner. Its crazy. My appetite has totally left. the food is really nasty here. Oh well. When I get home I'll make my parents take me out to a nice dinner. My boyfriend used to take me out to nice dinners, then for some reason her totally stopped. I'm kind of materialistic. or, at least that's what he'd say. but, I learned o accept it because I loved him. or at least I thought it was love. I don't' know yet, and I'll probably never know until I find someone who I feel the same way or more about. That hasn't happened yet. okay, times up. 
__label__label0 PROPNAME just walked into our apartment and PROPNAME is asleep. Maybe I need to work on some other stuff. This pre-testing page is down. it keeps shutting down every time I try to use it. I wonder why I even try sometimes. Why am I doing all this stuff enter night. into night  grain of sand. off to never-never land. I just typed PROPNAME lyrics. I don't even like ORGNAME   this is kind of weird. I don't think that I can keep doing this for 00 minutes. PROPNAME's starting to wake up now. at least most of my studies are done because I'm going to play ORGNAME later tonight. Do I play at Trees or not?  I just think that it will be too hard to actually get to LOCNAME in time to do it. I can't relax enough to do stream of consciousness. I'm completely aware of everything I'm typing even though it's not selective. boy PROPNAME is loud. PROPNAME's so cute when she's sleeping. she's starting to wake up. oh wow. I can see her underwear. she'd be a bit embarrassed. she's up know. and gave me a big smile.        now she's laughing at me. now she's trying to talk to me and distract me from my work. going on for twenty minutes?   My word. I don't have time for this. I think I have the Psychology department figured out but I think they just have everybody take these intro psyche classes so they can get info for their own experiments. they just make it look like a class so they have a bunch of subjects. a cigar. I could use one right now. I'm so stressed out. I'm tired of that bare naked Ladies song. PROPNAME is talking to me right now. what a moron he is. . just about random stuff. . yes go on. exchange the genesis for mario kart. that's a good idea. we're getting mario kart. . I guess I'm going for twenty minutes. . it's been a long time. I have no more to write. I'm going now. by0e. 
__label__label1 it stresses me . I this what I want to do or I am finishing something merely because I feel I have to. I think this is what I want my degree in but just maybe not what I want to do seriously. I am so much happier about my life at school already. I want to meet a good guy that I can hang out with and not worry about how I look and stupid stuff like that. I just hope it happens pretty soon. I love art now. There something so mysterious about it to me. What were they thinking?  Although I think some of it is sketchy as to call it some sort of meaningful piece but I guess it is to them. It is definitely one of those things left to the beholder. I am not sure if I buy into all this psychology stuff,  It is a little hard to follow. We'll see. Just out of curiosity, what are they going to be able to tell about me from this bit of blabber. I bet they read a lot of weird stuff. I am normal, I guess. Sometimes I am a bit complicated but in an interesting way, of course. I do stress about that. If I am to complicated for the guys I am around at school. So many of them are just existing until their next beer. Get a life. and a job. I think I am looking in the wrong place. maybe I am looking and that is my problem. It is kind of something that makes time pass. You know, waiting for the next guy, wondering what he'll be like, if you know him already, if he has a girlfriend. I am stressing that I will have to stay up too late tonight. Couldn't stay awake in class,  That bothers me. It is rude. I don't know what to say for 00 minutes. I probably won't go the whole time. I have a lot to do. I wonder what they think of me so far. Honestly what I am thinking now is not always what is on my mind so forming some sort of a synopsis is unjust. Just checked to see how much I had written. This is really boring, you know. I talk to myself all day. The last thing I wanted to do was write it down. I have to try to balance my spending every month. I have 0 weeks left and its not looking good, already. If only I had a job, I wouldn't feel so bad about asking for extra cash every month. But I don't and I do feel bad. I must go, this is driving me insane. I keep thinking about what I have to do. 
__label__label1 I believe sometimes I think to much about what's at hand. I always have to be scheduled and know what's to come. I wonder if its just good discipline or if its a problem. For example its the first day of class and I'm doing the writing assignments already, it was my mind so I did it. My mind is wandering, I'm thinking about my girlfriend at home and what she is doing and thinking about, hopefully me of course. What are my other friends doing that went to others schools, do they feel pressured. What am I suppose to be thinking or typing about. I wonder if your looking for any certain topic we should be thinking about. Am I going to do well in this class, will I get an A, B , C, D, or even fail? I guess I will find Out Eventually. 
__label__label1 ever since the first day of school on august 00 I have felt so much fear. it has never hit me so hard as right now typing on a computer  not knowing one person around me yet some of them being my classmates. my thoughts of u t are hard to explain. some days are bad some good, it just depends on the day and class. I grew up in a small town went to the same school district my whole life and graduated with 00 people in my class. my psychology class has close to000. its very overwhelming . I have made a few new friends but I still feel very alone. I live with my boyfriend off campus and its hard. I just feel very alone. my parents seem to have forgotten about me, but the already had by the time my senior year had come. my brother goes to tarleton in stephenville near ft worth. my best friend goes to LOCNAME a m in college station. i'm taking 00hrs and my favorite class is swimming. I'm really bored and I want to go shopping after I get done with this writing assignment,. english is my last class today and it ended early at 0000. I'm really bored and only 00 minutes have gone by I'm tired of writing. I hate seeing all the little rich girls with their fancy clothes walking around campus. it pisses me off because I screwed up and moved into a apartment. early this morning I was in the lab signing in to use a mac. the computer told me to go to b0 so I did and when I got to the computer there was stuff on it but the computer screen had my number on it so I know to use it . but the bitch comes up and starts freaking out about it was her computer. people piss me off because my parents taught me respect and politeness and everyone at ut seems to thing that they need to be rude I just don't get it I'm thinking of transferring to LOCNAME a m because I went down there to help move my best friend into her apartment and I had the best time I've ever had. we went to a bar and I drank at the bar and I'm only 00 so we had fun you could never get away with that down here in austin. its almost time for me to stop then I'm going shopping with the little money I have. I can't wait to get off campers because boyfriends name is jimmy and he is going to go to acc in the spring to get a degree in electrical technicians he already is one but he want a degree to  get more money. it almost time to stop its almost time to stop its almost time to stop then go home it's labor day weekend and I'm so glad because were having a party at the lake house and taking the boat out to go skiing,. can't wait. well its time to stop so I'll  
__label__label0 I really think the professor is funny and can hold the class' attention.    I am listening to a PROPNAME PROPNAME's CD. I was never really a big fan of his until recently. My roommate and best friend ( she is also taking this class) loves PROPNAME PROPNAME. She asked me to go to his concert with her months in advance. I had heard a few of his songs, and even though I wasn't crazy about them, I agreed to go. It was two weeks before the concert and a really good friend of ours was moving to LOCNAME to go to graduate school. PROPNAME PROPNAME was going to be in LOCNAME on Friday and LOCNAME on Saturday. So PROPNAME ( my roommate) decided to sell her tickets and we would help PROPNAME move and see the concert in LOCNAME. On our way to LOCNAME the U-Haul had a blow out and a few other tragadies occured, forcing us to miss the concert. PROPNAME was devastaed. So Saturday we headed back to LOCNAME and bought tickets to go. After several beers we were there. Somehow I got seperated from my friends. When we found each other I cried, I think it was from the alchol. Anyways, we happened to be at the right place at the right time and a guy came up to us and brought us armbands to go to the front of the stage. I pushed my was to the very front and managed to convince a bodygaurd to give me a backstage pass. At the end of the show they took me backstage, gave me flowers and then showed me to PROPNAME. I was the only one that wasn't freaking out backstage, so he came up to me. We talked and he signed my ticket (the only thing I had on me). He left but came uback up to me five min later. I was talking to somebody and I saw soomeone come up besaide me. Then I felt a hand on my breast (the right one). It was PROPNAME, signing my chest. I thought I would faint. His voice is so sexy. Later right before he left, he came up to me and kissed me. I love him and will marry him one day.    Sorry I wasted ten min blabbing about the same story. I guess the point of the entry to to see how many ways my brain goes. I just thought of something else. I have a crush on a waiter that I work with. I'm a hostess. I haven't had a crucsh like this in a long time. I'm so mad because he didn't work today or yesterday and he won't work until Friday. I don't even know anything about him. That's probably why I like him. The last guy I dated was gay. He won't admit it but I know he is. We're not seeing each other anymore. I usually don't talk about guys this much, but for some reason they are on the brain tonight. I just set up my email account today. I'm soo excited. My parents have been bugging me to get one. I'm using a friends computer right now, but we will have the internet set up by Friday.  I really hope no one reads this horrible shit. I know it doesn't make any sense and no one cares about any of it. I have to go read 00 chapters for English now. Aren't you jealous??!!  
__label__label0 In fact I always think about her whenever I have a spare moment. She is in my every thought. She is so far away from me, yet in my heart she is so close. I read some poetry tonight, Love Sonnets, and all I could think about was her. She is so beautiful. I long for the next time I can see her. It seems like only yesterday we met for the first time. I talk about her constantly to all my friends to the point, where they are either sick of hearing about her, or know her almost as well as I do. I know it's not the best thing to go through, but I am seem to be sad all the time. Not literally, or maybe literally, but it is hard to explain. I love her more then life itself, but I "hate" her for leaving me. Not really hate, but I don't know how to explain it, but more like I guess a little dislike. Nothing I can't handle, I just wish she was here with me. It doesn't seem fair. I see all of my friend's with their significant others, and they are next to each other always. Sharing all the "special" moments in their lives, but I have to wait at least a week, before I can call her. The bill is too expensive otherwise. I beg her to come back, knowing full and well, that she can't do that, but it seems to help but sometimes hurt at the same time. She is so special to me, and I can wait forever for her. Most people think that is absurd, but she is my everything. Being sad a lot I know is to a degree not healthy, but what can I do. The moment she walked down the corridor in the airport, I heart stopped smiling. Since that gloomy day in June, a part of me has been gone. Although I smile on the outside, on the inside I am sad. The day her sweet embrace takes me in, only then can I smile. That day is not too far away, and I long for it. I guess this is the best part of being sad, because I feel better thinking about the future, the only thing is that it is a type of perpetual loop. As soon as I think about the future and being with her, I get sad again thinking that I have to wait another few months. Then I think about all the times that I will be "alone" without her. As much as my friends are great, I have none really. She is my one and only TRUE friend. I have some friends, I. e. my roommate, and a several other people that genuinely care, but most of them don't. I have pretty much stopped "trying" to be there as much as I have in the past. I feel that I am only a friend in the convenience of someone else. I feel that they only come to talk to me when they need something, or when something is wrong for them. I used to try so much, but in the past month's I have stopped trying. That may not be the answer, but it is something that I have come to. I tell all my friends that if they do need me, then I will be there for them. I called to see how my friends were. I paged them telling the just a simple "hello". Calling them randomly just to check if everything was cool. And that favor was never really returned. So, now I don't care as much. I am still there if someone needs me. I could NEVER abandon a friend. I care too much about people for that. All of this leads me back to my girlfriend. She is the one person that ALWAYS cares about how I am feeling. She always knows when something is wrong or bothering me. She always wants to take care of me and love me. And for that I return the feelings back 00x over. I love her and I don't want anything ever to happen to her, so I check with her as much as I can. She is some kind of special and I can't let her go. She is too good to me. It's moments like these where I get to feel better about my situation, because I know everything will be fine in the "end", but at this moment in my life, I am not so much worried about the "end" as the now. Maybe worried isn't the best word. I just wish she was here to spend time with me. So we could eat dinner together, go see a movie together, to study together, to love together. All the couple things and all the friend things. It just seems unfair, and then there are points like now, where I miss her like crazy and I think I am going to go nuts without her. I know I can be strong and I can surpass this and the end will be that much sweeter. So with that in mind, I can end this "journal" entry on a good note and feel good about everything. 
__label__label1 I am thinking about PROPNAME and wondering if we will get married. I am really happy but then there is PROPNAME, who wants to get in my calculus class and my teacher is an absolute freak. what is a freak anyway I don't know but I have heard that there are a lot of freaks here. my roommate is asking me what I am doing and I want to tell her that I am typing on my computer. can't she see that? some people are just redundant. this paper is redundant and life is redundant. people keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again, and they don't see the pattern. it took me a while to see the pattern of my redundancy but now I see the pattern and I still make the same mistakes. I always make mistakes and I do the same stuff and I didn't even make a sorority and I really don't really care. I can't type fast at all now I am stealing my roommates thoughts maybe I just am really dependent on other people and I can't even think for my self. Hey sweetie? What's your name and major? I just heard my messages and they are not even my messages because I cannot think with my roommate complaining about how popular she is, I used to be popular I was so damn popular. And now I am just a number-my social security number Gone is my identity and my boyfriend and my family and my roommate is trying to sleep and I am getting tired. I wonder what you would say, yeah you, if I told you that I slept through your psychology class and don't really care about what everyone has going on in their messed up heads. I am doing this because I have to, I have to do this and I have to be responsible. I can't believe that my father yelled at me today He is lying when he says he loves me. He told me that the only person he ever loved is mom and if I am rude to her once more then I will suffer. like what is he going to do? Put me in a gas chamber or send me to jail worth no food?  I can't believe this stuff is happening to me, At the party tonight I felt miserable. I hate PROPNAME for making me hurt so bad, I hate loving someone that is so far away. I hate the way I feel that I am missing out, but when I try to lead a normal college life I only wish I was at his house playing pool. I'm good at pool now. The holes on his pool table are smaller than average so that when I play on a real table I could really hustle somebody. PROPNAME I ever been hustled? What all can one be hustled in? I must be the victim of some huge pimp like hustle that follows me around and lets me fall on my ass when I feel good about myself, I hate you PROPNAME PROPNAME, I hate your lies and my lies to everyone about you, I would have made it somewhere had you never kissed me and hustled me. I wish that this computer would stop beeping, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME needs to sleep. 
__label__label1 I'm pretty happy with my first week and a half of classes. I've met a lot of people. It means a lot to me. I am a very quiet, sort of shy person. I was afraid of coming to ORGNAME because I'm not the best at making friends. So far though, it hasn't been a problem. My big classes have been a little intimidating because of there size. I used to have classes about 00 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 00 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food. My brother brought it to LOCNAME. He and I will share it. I'm already starting to miss home-cooked meals. I think my 00 minutes are just about up. I probably fix a bite to eat, watch a little T. V. and go to sleep. 
__label__label1 at this point I am very unsure of what exactly to do or where my direction for the future is. My paranoia that I developed from living in ny has certainly overcome my life as everyday is almost a struggle at times to go on because I so easily find something to mess it up. I feel as if everything is always ready to go wrong, so I guess I need a more optimistic view of my life so I don't have to have negative beliefs everyday that ruin a perfect day.  I guess I am also questioning whether I belong in LOCNAME or if I should return to LOCNAME and transfer to nyu business school. I will need a 0. 0 both semesters which will be close to impossible for myself in order to stay here. in addition I also wonder if I belong here and if I can fit in with everyone else. they are all nice to me but I just wonder if I can fit in and if they are all being fake to me behind my back, not that I don't already have to deal with that in ny. if it were not for people I could trust like PROPNAME or PROPNAME or a very few others than I don't think I could make it here. I am very surprised to find how certain people have just drifted away and its like I make an effort and they don't even care about it. I just feel that sometimes things are not any better here than in ny and if it came down to the two I would probably just go back to NYC.   NYC has a very special importance to me. I feel in a weird way that I can fit in there and it is my real home. to have the opportunity to live there for college and party all the time is really exciting, although I wonder if it would be the right choice to go back east since I was so miserable there. PROPNAME is the only person who I can count on and maybe even PROPNAME if I was not so pissed at her for going out with mike, but then again maybe that is my fault. if I wasn't so flirty and actually expressed my feelings than maybe it could have worked a lot better, but then again I always find someway to screw things up as usual which always haunts me at every task or thing now because I go in with such a negative attitude all the time. hopefully I can have another positive year like last time and it will help me be more confident. In the mean time I really need to focus on new goals and establish myself more positively:       0. get a 0. 0 average so I have the opportunity to stay if I want to but keep all transfers in mind especially nyu or something in the LOCNAME area in case I feel the need to leave.    0. keep working out and getting big - competition is tough and I have to compete with you know who so I feel as if I must keep on going and hopefully it will work and I will look decent for once in my life - I also need to stay healthy and I need, I want a 0 pack by years end if it kills me      0. work on being social despite my physical problems and hopefully I will win out with whatever way it goes      0. help your community out and help others - remember you have been bad and need to fulfill certain things because the lord put me here for a reason and I want to be helpful and give happiness to others since I am not happy at least     Remember to keep it real and tight  . CAN'T NOBODY HOLD ME DOWN!!!!  I CAN'T STOP! I WON'T STOP! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO STOP!   ) 
__label__label0 what to write?  I am happy right now because I just got a phone call from a  frat that I am going to join. we are having a get together tomorrow and there are going to be strippers!  that should be cool. but I don't know what to wear. I always get nervous about what I should wear. I hope my girlfriend does not find out, even though I will probably tell her, and she'll probably get mad like she sometimes does. I wonder when clay is coming home?  we have to work out tonight, and I still have a lot of Persian how to do. my throat feels better today than it has all weekend. I was really sick for the last three days so I stayed home and watched the 00th anniv. of Planet of the Apes. that was a good movie. I have never seen any before and now I want to go buy the  whole set because it was so good. but I need to get my job first and save up my money for headshots, an agent, then I can buy crap like new clothes and videos and cds. I can't wait until tomorrow, it is going to be so much fun!  I hope that I feel okay. I feel better today but tomorrow I need to be totally healthy. I hope I did one of those things where I got sick at a good time so I didn't miss anything important. This writing takes forever, I have other stuff I need to do to. Oh, well, it's for science. I m bored. my eyes are drying out from looking at the computer screen. when is clay going to get back?  I also have some theater homework I need to do. I am so tired, maybe I should just forget the how and go to bed early so I feel good tomorrow. yeah then I could fail all my classes and get kicked out of LOCNAME. that would suck. I did nothing today. it was a relaxing though somewhat boring day. but I needed it because I have been sick all weekend. I have been able to start smoking again, but I really should quit sometime soon. I am tired, it's hard to focus. I guess my body has been working over time to kill this damn disease I got. I need to call laila, I miss her. maybe we could all play solarquest. my neck is stiff but I still have 00 minute to write. this takes forever. I wonder when it is due?  I heard the 00th but I am not so sure. I wonder what the other assignment is about. I hope it is not like this. ,  I have a lot to do tonight but I must be in bed by 00. I need all the sleep I can get. I am tired. this is really starting to bore me. what is the point? write down every thought you think. seems creepy. I hope who ever reads this one is laughing and enjoying themselves. some how I doubt it. this is not very funny--it would be though, if I could say it. I hope no one minds all the hundreds of mistakes I made, and if they do, who cares?  what are they going to do?  put in computer jail?  Someone I knew said that all the time. but I can not remember who. I miss PROPNAME. I wonder how she is doing at PROPNAME PROPNAME state. I also miss jena, I really hope I see her before she goes and flies off to LOCNAME. I hope her life is not hard, and I wish here and michael all the best. my ear hurts. four minutes left. I was beginning to feel trapped in time. stuck forever by this computer typing away through all eternity. I am really tired, but I am glad I got this one out of the way. just a couple of minutes left. that woman at the dinner was so weird. and what about her HUGE 0 year old?  that was scary, but so is "Walt" so I guess it is okay. Well time has run out and now it is time to go. that took forever. 
__label__label0 Although, I constantly advocate to my friends that one should make the best of everything, I failed to do so. Recently, I have noticed a drastic change in my life. Prior to the major transition of my life (college), I used to constantly worry. worry. worry. Although I still worry, I have learned to view life from another perspective. Each and every minute I must be productive, but no longer is my school work the only "productive" thing in my life. I realized that simply chatting with some friends or relaxing can result into a more elaborate learning experience then simply books. For instance, I was watching a movie last night (something I rarely do because I feel I am not being productive) that enhanced my knowledge of the world around me. Very few movies make me think long after I finished watching the movie, but this one did. The overall design and structure of the movie was not to great, but the plot behind the movie sparked some circuits and made me question particular aspects of life. All in all, I am trying to stress that I am still learning regardless of what I do. This certain attitude towards life has allowed me to be open-minded and not as stressed out as usual. Today, I have several things to do. My priority list is very long, but I am limited with time. It seems the more I think about how much I have to do, the less time I have to do it. I have two tests next week. Chemistry and Calculus, respectively. My weekend is going to be centered around studying for those two tests. Hopefully, my mind will allow me to concentrate on those two tests and only those two tests. Austin, or rather LOCNAME, is a very convenient campus. Opposed to my hometown, LOCNAME allows me to travel many places on foot or even by bus. This form of transportation is very tempting!  I just bought a laptop which I am very excited about. I felt rushed when I bought it, but it is too late now. I still have to buy a PC card for it so I can access the internet from my dorm. I want to designate a weekend to upgrading and buying software for my computer, but I have so many things on my mind. By the time I get around to doing so, a whole new line of computers will be on the market!!!  My life is busy, hectic, stressful, etc. But, I enjoy it!  I am confused on what organizations I should join here at LOCNAME. I am used to being a part of and active in nearly everything I am offered. Here at UT, I am unaware of everything they have to offer and therefore, not a participant in everything I want to join. I hope that I will gradually reach the peak I was at in high school. I am sure I will. I was  unaware of my surroundings a minute ago and this man was asking me a question. whoops. I believe I have reached my goal now, after reading the assignment nearly 00 times.     
__label__label0 Not only was the server down but it has taken several minutes to upload, even when I am connected at 00000 bps. I'm also seemingly tired because I just got back from water polo practice and we did a lot of swimming today. I feel a sense of responsibility doing this assignment and the others so I can get  back to reading the text and doing other subjects. At this point I'm winding down the day to get ready for bed and this is the time to release all the stress and aches  and to clear my thoughts. The only thoughts the come to my mind are what I will put in this assignment after each word. I do feel a little amused because I am also having a conversation over the internet with a friend in LOCNAME, so I am not totally out of it yet. I also have to arrange my classes for the next day so I can be prepared with my bag and books I guess. I also need to set my clock and get ready to wash up and finish this letter. But I guess this is all the time I have and I will be ending this right now   :-) 
__label__label0 Since I am already on the computer I am going to do 0 writing assignment. That's good because I wont have to worry about it later. I can take care of other things on my list, and I 'll be that much closer to going home. I like my new place. Its big and cold and my best buds live there. Theyre all cool except for the new guy, jon. This fella really has a stick up his ass. I respect that he works full time and is usually tired, but come on. Working doesn't give you any special rights except to get a paychek. It sure doesn't mean that all of your roommates should feel sorry for you and get you things. I can tell this is going to be a problem. We've already had words several times. What blew my mind was that this guy was willing to let it escalate into a fistfight in less than a minute. I mean, he's got to live with me for a whole year!  Am I the only one thinking here?  I really had to get raw then, telling him that that is NOT how we handle things in a civilized society, especially mine. He wants to shack up with me, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME, then he has to realize that we're tight and that if anybody gets roughed up, its him. Also, PROPNAME's girlfriend has become a permanent fixture, already. I don't understand why she can't live where she pays rent, and carry on a relationship simultaneously. Everyone else does. I love bob to death, but this woman is no good for him. They're engaged, and she still gives everybody the "look" when he leaves the room. I feel sorry for him. But I should probably be glad it's not still me. I think the only reason that I bitch about some things is that it frustrates to see my bros not have it together like I do. Like half of my boys from dobie last year aren't even coming back. and the clincher, the real salt in the wound, is that none of them couldn't mentally make it here, its that they were so fucking lazy and unmotivated that they pissed it all away. Those were some of my best friends ever. I'll keep in touch with them, but when I talk to them I always feel a twinge of anger at them for not filling thier end of the bargain. They say they'll be back next semester, but I don't believe. A lot of them are so lazy that not even seeing what they'll miss is enough to get their attention. That's why I stay focused and that's why I'll stay at ut. 
__label__label1 I took a class in sewimming last year and it was a lot of fun. my cousin megan asked me to come to her dance recital in october but that is going to kind of difficult since I have three tests on the following week of school when I get back but life is short I may as well seize the day. I didn't call my girlfriend last night so she is probably mad about that but anyway. I like the class schedule that I am taking right now but it is only thirteen hours so I hope I finish my degree plan in four years since I don't want to be in school forever. I have a headache and don't feel like doing anything but relaxing. I wish I was traveling righnt now maybe around the swiss alps and doing some hiking camping and fishing and even some swimming just exploring beautiful places that I have never been to before. I woild love to just have a job where I could explore travel destinations and tell people if it was a good place or not or even just travel the world. I love adventures especially the ones like indiana jones does in his series of movies I think that that is so interesting and fun but I kjnow it is only a dream since all of that is just make believe but hopeuflly on e day I will get married and we can travel the world exploring different copuntries and places and seeing everything this world has to offer. this summer I got to visit seattle and it was very beautiful except that it rained every single day adn that got kind of depressing and made you feel gloomy but it was an experience and a very expensive one at athat. this christmas me and my cousince and bro are goign to go on a road trip kind of like the one on mtv called road rules where we go exploring places and then camping out and living off the land which is really a lot of fun. I hope my mom is having a good day and my dad and sister. my brother is up here in austin with me so we hang out my birthday is tomorrow and I will be the big 00 I can't wait. my firneds are throwing me a party this weekend so it is going to be a lot of fun. I have math homewrok thath I need to do  
__label__label0 I'm planning a trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME, and I don't exactly have any real place to stay(besides the car). I guess I always feel a little more nervous about the state of my affairs before I do any physical activity during the day. I think that the endorphins make a big change in my thoughts and state of being. I enjoy physical activity to for the competitive aspect. Recently, I've come to enjoy more extreme sports such as mountain biking, street hockey, and surfing. These sports seem to add an aspect of danger which makes the adrenaline run even faster. It reminds of the Goo Goo Dolls song "Iris" where the singer writes about "bleeding just to know your alive. "  The mixture of hard physical workout and a sense of danger accompanied with adrenaline add color to life where it wasn't there before and give a sense of perspective to other areas of life. I can't help but wonder if this passage is being influenced by the music I'm listening to on the CD player. I think that it's probably still an accurate representation because I don't know  if music can do anything but influence or bring out different parts of yourself. Speaking of music I'm going to play guitar as much as I possibly can now because I've beaten the video game Goldeneye. I'd also like to start writing more. I haven't written in awhile and it's something that I've been missing. The opportunity to be reflective and listen to yourself is a wonderful thing which I haven't been taking advantage of lately. I'd like to publish a book eventually with the sum of a lot of my writing. It would be like a journal of varied types of entries which would open a gateway into the inner recesses of my mind, a window into the core of my being. There are many different enjoyable aspects to writing. In addition to the chance to look at yourself and life, the ability to meld your thoughts into words in the most eloquent way possible is a fabulous thrill. Speaking of acts of creation, I would also like to take more pictures with my new camera. I'm trying to expand my self as a visual artist through photography. I hope to capture a little of the essence of my experiences through the lens of the camera. I took some really good pictures on my last two rolls. The best picture appears to be the result of serendipity. I took a picture at LOCNAME LOCNAME of some of the Indian ruins, and out of the shadows of the rocks, a giant face appears. It's an incredible picture. It's a better picture than I thought I'd ever take. I hope I have the gift of capturing beauty on film. It would be a neat talent to have. 
__label__label1 I guess I'll use this space to rant about this topic. Yes, I used to have a car. She's a silver-blue '00 Camry that my mom bought when I was in first grade. She was the first new car my mom ever bought, and I think she made a good choice. She bought a new Camry in '00, when I turned sixteen, which, by the way, is the nicest car I've ever had the pleasure of riding in. Strap $00,000 to the dashboard, and you have a Lexus. But anyway, I drove the old Camry, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME (after Nine Inch Nails' debut album, which is awesome)until I went away to college last year, on my little sister's 00th birthday. So you can probably guess what happened to her (the Camry, not my sister). Yes she got two huge dents in it, running into the same garage behind the restaurant where we work, a garage around which I have managed to maneuver countless times without causing bodily harm to Pretty Hate Machine (which my sister so rudely calls "The Velvet Rocket!!!"). OK, I crashed her once and busted her right headlight, but it wasn't my fault, and the other lady's insurance paid for it all, and I felt terrible for putting her (the car) through all that. PROPNAME showed not the slightest sign of regret for her thoughtless actions, having no respect for Pretty Hate Machine.    She's such a great car. First of all, she screams "MOM," so I never get pulled over in her, not even during the six months she had a busted headlight. She might as well have vanity plates that say "MOM, RN. "  Second, she's the most reliable car in the world, which is one of the reasons I felt bad when I crashed her, because she's not used to the shop at all. No, she's never broken down. She's got 000,000 miles on her, yes, she's "been around the black" a few times, rrhaha. She's never broken down. Third, I love her because she's idiot-proof. She doesn't just have that beeping noise when you don't fasten your seatbelt;  she turns the headlights and the dome light off when you leave the car, so you'd have to be worse than an idiot to run out the battery, which my sister did I might add. And you have to lock it from the outside, or else 0 door stays unlocked, so you can't lock your keys in her. She's the perfect car. Oh, and since she's so old and a 0-seater, she's cheap to insure.    Yes, I have a sort of sick emotional attachment to her, but she's just so awesome. She's like an heirloom, having been in the family long enough to serve two generations. I get to drive her whenever I go home, which is nice. It's hard to take her for granted when I don't get to see her that much. Oh, I forgot to add that We took our family Christmas card picture in front of, with me holding the keys out in front of my face. There was this really cute boy in high school named PROPNAME PROPNAME who drove the same car, except he had the windows tinted so that he could drive and be sketchy at the same time, I guess. Anyway, I thought he was cute, and the fact that he drove such an awesome yet practical was somehow really sexy to me. And this summer There was this guy named PROPNAME who worked at the same restaurant I did back home who drove the exact same car, except his was more gray than blue. We somehow a big kick out of trying to park our cars next to each other, or opposite each other, or in some geometric configuration. What really kills about her is that every day when I pass by the ORGNAME on the way to class there she is, parked right there, the exact same car, taunting me, torturing me. I miss my Ol' Girl. 
__label__label1 But I can't go to sleep because I have mounds of homework to do. The drive back here from home, just wore me out completely, and that is why I didn't have any time earlier to do my homework. I still need to take a shower. Then I have to wake up early in the morning and figure out where my biology discussion class is, so I can go in there and take the dumb quiz that the TA gives out. Too bad, I am going to fail it. The lectures my prof. gives, just don't really make since. I wish that my best friend PROPNAME and I could've spent more time together when I was home this past weekend. I also wish that my boyfriend PROPNAME would send me an email. I wish that we could somehow get passed this stupid problem we are having. It's hard enough him being in LOCNAME, then he has to go and get some weird attitude and get mad and not be himself. It is really making me mad, and sad all at once. I wish that I could see him, and knock some since into his head and then everything would be okay. PROPNAME is the only one that knows enough about us for me to talk to about our relationship problems. But I hate boring her to death with it, I don't want to get on her nerves about it. This past summer, everything was fine, and now it is all so different, I hate it. But there is nothing I can do about it. And then there is Matt which just gets on my nerves. He is my good friend from the past year, although we've known each other for going on 0 years. He just aggravates me, the way he is so scatter brained. I just get so frustrated, and tired of it. Poor guy, I feel sorry for him. Then, my mind always, swings back to PROPNAME. I can't ever not think about us, and this problem we are having. I so need to talk to him about it because I can't function unless everything is resolved. And it is driving me absolutely CRAZY. But he won't talk about it, he won't talk to me. And I am not the kind of person that can just drop it. I can't just say, oh well, and then forget about it. I have it on me for quite a long while. Every day, I see or hear at least 00 things that remind me of him or us together. Its so depressing. I hate being this way, all depressed and not my peppy, cheerful self. Well, I see that the 00 minutes are up now. SO long. 
__label__label1 Coincidentally I always manage to surround myself with strange characters that unfortunately seem to have no passion for life, with the exception of a few. I seem to notice that the majority of people are concerned with the trivial, the meaningless the absurd. Fitting into societal norms seems to dominate my generation. I feel a tremendous amount of pressure to fulfill my existence to the maximum without leaving pout my loved one's or those who do not seem to pursue the same spiritual quest that I seem to be challenged with. The awakening of this dream has led me to search more "myself". Where should I begin? It is rare when I feel somebody is listening or understanding where I come from. These strange characters which I always seem to attract are convinced that their perspective on things is the only thing that matters and that the phenomenon of life is something one should get over, move on, think about something else like how you are going to succeed in life. I live in a dream state where the symbols of nature are constantly confronting me leaving me confounded and in awe but how do I move past that in order to fulfill and answer many of my questions which at this point are leaving me insatiable. Lately I've been paying attention to my dreams. I've noticed a pattern of dreams THAT LEAD OR SIGNAL TO A HIGHER SOURCE , BEING, STATE of consciousness. I can't contemplate the beauty, the colors, it all seems so supernatural and nobody seems to understand much least care about what they're. I've also had a couple f nightmares where I am constantly being watched and followed by a large amount of males. I guess I have difficulty and although I ashamed about this, I have a hidden fear of the male gender. I look around and I see a patriarchal world that insists on leading me to believe that everything is difficult and only the very best, the smartest will survive and coincidentally most of them happen to be men. Anger dominates this thought,  all my life I've been able to pull through "waking up" has made me realize that we are in "deep shit'. I mean I walk into my college chemistry class and this beautiful blonde woman is teaching this class of about 000 people and I am in awe. Why is it so difficult to contemplate that a woman does have the innate ability to do science. This woman reminds me of myself. I am mad at myself for finding myself noticing the fact that she is female. I question how she is treated by her male dominated colleagues. Do they underestimate her, how hard does she have to work in order to prove herself, and if she were ugly would it make a difference. It is too difficult to overlook these questions I face them everyday. Constantly have to prove myself and I am sick and tired of the preconceived notions that people have about women 
__label__label0 I'm not so sure how I felt about it yet. Not that it was bad or anything, but I'm just not sure how the questions asked could lead to a better understanding of an individual. It seemed to me that questions that were asked only dealt with a couple of issues. Mostly gender, weight, and scared issues. But than again, I guess the experiments that I did this for will probably deal with those issues. I really don't know why I tried to do that survey right when I got up this morning, I just about fell asleep on the keyboard, but that's alright, I finally got through it. after it frizzed up on me 0 times. That was a little frustrating. There is something else that's really bothering me right now also. Nothing to do with school, but socially. I live in LOCNAME, and hate to say it, but I am a pretty stereotypical LOCNAMEn kid. I mention this because I have this burning passion for the ocean. Even most people who live in LOCNAME don't feel as deeply about it as I do. I knew it was going to be hard to leave the ocean when I came to school, but I didn't want to shut myself off from new opportunities and experiences by staying close to the water. Well anyway, I really miss the ocean. Every night I try to picture the crashing waves, and feel the cool mist on an earl morning. When I walk to class I even feel it in my feet and legs. Just on their own my legs begin to surf. The same muscle motions, I guess they call it muscle memory. I can feel myself cutting up the face of a racing wave and slashing the hell out of the lip. Or just grabbing the rail of my board on a meaty left, stalling, and hear the swirl of the water and air in the tube. That's all I live for. or lived for. LOCNAME seems to have stopped my love for a little while. No I take that back, nothing can stop my love for it, I guess LOCNAME just got in the way for a little while. That's where my problem comes up socially. I now realize that if you're not in California, or any beach community for that matter, people just don't understand. I feel like people just view me as some tan kid that dresses a little funny, and claims he does this thing called surfing. Like I said, the perfect stereotype. I guess I wouldn't mind being a poster boy, if kids just knew how I felt. How the ocean just pulls you in, and won't let go. It's a way of life, not just a social activity. It's a culture, and it's become who I am. Not just surfing. I love it but that is only one small facet of why I love the ocean. I just fall asleep every night dreaming of all the good times I've had there. Whether it be piling into one of my friends cars at 000 in the morning for a dawn patrol session without anybody else in the water. Skateboarding down the boardwalk, trying to race the waves as they peel away. Just sitting on the sand with my good friends, talking about anything and everything at the same time. or going there alone, at night to just erase all the thoughts and bad things that happened that day, week, month , or even year. The ocean can do all of that. But people don't seem to realize that. I love LOCNAME, well I don't know if I love LOCNAME. but I definitely love ORGNAME, it's just that I have to sacrifice so much more that I realized that I would have to do. I came here and had to leave the biggest, most passionate part of me back home. That's hard for anyone to do regardless of what it might be. It's not that I feel like I'm viewed as an outsider here. more of a novelty, or attraction actually. But I just wish people would have the same opportunities as I did, or have. I want them to fall in love as I did. But that's impossible if you stay in LOCNAME for a lifetime. Come to think of it, I really haven't even talked to many of my friends from back home, I think I'm going to do that today. I've been so focused on making a home for myself here, that I lost sight of the one back in SD. I'm going to make a promise to myself that I will never lose touch of what I left back home, or the people that I left. Just tuck them away as memories, fond memories as I continue to grow, and add to those memories here. 
__label__label0 I tried to clam her down before talking to her about what was wrong. When I finally got a complete sentence out of her she told me that a girl who I was friends with, well we weren't like best friends or anything, but I had two classes with her and talked to her everyday, had been killed in a car accident earlier that day. I sat there for a second not even realizing what she was saying. When I got off the phone I went to my mom and told her very matter-of-factly what had happened. The next day I went to school not knowing what to expect, but after having been in class for only a short while and hearing my teachers and principal attempting to explain what happened and try and calm everyone down I was bawling. That's when it hit me, I just didn't understand it. Walking into the classrooms which I had shared with her only the day before was the weirdest feeling, I could see my other classmates in the hall and as they reached the classroom, some screamed, some wept and some just turned and walked away very quickly. The following days were exhausting, I don't think I had every cried that much in my life. I couldn't be at home alone, I don't know what I was afraid of, except just having time to think about it. Despite the hurting that I and the others that knew her felt, I was happy for her. She was in a better place, she was an awesome person and I have no doubt that she is in Heaven now. The funeral was huge it felt like our entire school was there. Her closest friends, including her boyfriend who was driving the car that day, all got up and told funny stories about her and how awesome she really was, that was comforting, but also extremely hard to listen to. At the intersection where she was killed people gathered at all hours of the day and night, it was a very saddening sight to see all of her friends just staring at the cross surrounded by flowers, her favorite candy and pictures, which still stands there. When I went to the cross all I could do was stare at the street and the markings which the police had made only a short time before. After the funeral I only went to her grave once and that was after attending my neighbors funeral, they were buried practically next to each other. It was all I could do to keep my attention on the service. When the time had finally come for my to walk over to her spot, I was fine until I faced it directly and saw her picture laying among the flowers and notes everyone had left. I lost it, I almost fell, but my sister caught me. I was a mess. I wrote her countless letters that never made it to the cross or to the site, but I know she knows how I feel and that comforts me. I pray for her family and close friends all the time, it was hard enough for me I can't imagine what it was like for them. 
__label__label1 bored. I'm supposed to be going out on a saturday night, but I'm not. it's a saturday night and I'm sitting in front of a computer, instead of at the Roxy with all the sororities. maybe it's good because I'll finally be set on the track of that good work thing my mom's been talking about. mom's upset.

__label__label1 Tomorrow I'm going to go back to my hometown of LOCNAME, LOCNAME, where I get the chance to revisit some of my old high school friends that are still in high school, and some friends that have graduated as well, that will be home as well. I guess I'm looking forward to the weekend, however I realize that I am still missing a lot of the social activities that are going on at LOCNAME. Currently my roommate is pondering why I listen to so much music all the time. To tell you the truth, I really don't know why I do. One of the reasons may be that I grew up surrounded by music, my brother being a person that played a lot of it around the house, as well as the fact that a lof of my friends also listen to music a whole lot. I just saw the ORGNAME music awards, which was ok. I mean it started out cool and such. with three great bands on stage at once, however it kinda declined from there into some trendy mush of junk. Some bands these days I can hardly consider a "band" in the least sense of the word. I just remembered that I missed my SI meeting tonight. that which I am not too happy about, but I shall make an even harder attempt to make the next one. Sometimes I wonder why people don't like dorm life that much. I mean its a nice social place where you get to meet people, and sometimes the rooms arent THAT bad. not even in jester, which is supposedly the biggest dorm in the nation or something to that effect. I've been to other places and apartments, and I think I still like mine the best. or maybe its just my way of rationalizing to myself the living conditions that I recieved. I hope my ride back home tomorrow is expedient. I get so darn tired after car rides. you wouldnt think so after sitting down for three or more hours, but you always are. maybe its because the body expects you to be sleeping or something. who knows. I'm also doing laundry at the same time. really different than the laundry back home, seeing as how the dryers take the whole freaking day to dry your clothes. geez, I'll be up for a while. Sometimes I wonder why people can be such jerks to others, especially in relationships. In this summer alone, 0 of my close friends experienced breakups in relationships, either due to faults of their own, or others. 0 of them cheated on the other, which is something that is really bad. I guess the human mind likes to think that when you commit to someone else, you expect the same in return, no matter if you are drunk, stupid, wasted, etc. It's prolly also the lowest of things that one can do to another in a relationship as well. Luckily I was not immediately affected by any of the aforementioned incidents. I never really know what to say to people that get the sharp end of the stick in those situations either. I mean what can you say?? I'm sorry?  you'll do better next time?? hardly. It feels like I'm typing into a diary or something. which I don't keep. I really want to go see some live bands here in austin. I mean it IS supposedly the Live Music Capital of the world. or nation. whichever. its supposed to have something more than just 0th street. at least things in austin aren't that bad. my roommate's pretty cool, better than someone else I could've ended up with. the food. could be better. but its not too bad. Overall university life is pretty ok. a lot of people here are nice and friendly. barton springs is really really REALLY cold. man is it cold. I wish I had something to eat as of right now. I'm kinda hungry. at least the jester express is still open for a while. Some of my friends are wanting to go the jester late night express right now. which is a really good idea. good thing the time thingy is almost over. hopefully my laundry will almost be done as well. I hate doing laundry. I especially hate ironing. but I guess they're something that I'm just going to have to live with for the rest of my lfie. carpe diem. seize the day. dead poets society. a great movie. seizing the day however. I think at least. should only be done in short bursts, and not always. It just seems like looking at the short term benefits or consequences and never at the long term just seems kinda idiotic. right?  Some people I know take it way to the extreme. I wouldnt even know how to write it down. so now I'm wondering who's going to read this paper, and what they're going to think. or if anyone is going to even read it at all? pennebaker? the asian guy? that michelle girl?  who knows. that video that was showed last class was pretty weird. that guy/girl strapped to the machine. and all those brian waves. I guess it wasnt "weird. " just something that we don't see that often. it was pretty cool I guess. now I also know how to escape a lie detector test if there was ever a chance that I would be detained by the ORGNAME for some criminal knowledge that I may possess for some odd reason. who knows. 
__label__label0 well, I'm thinking right now about how thinking about what I'm going to write is going to effect what I'm going to write. I'm thinking that 00 minutes is a long time to write considering that I type at a fairly good clip. I'm thinking I won't start each sentence with I think. I've come up with the idea for the perfect television show. it'll be a cross between chips and pacific blue. it'll be about moped cops in missouri, it'll be called M. o. p. d. it'll star katie holmes and busta rhymes as the street savy ex con turned cop. no one on the force knows if he can be trusted, but he's found a friend in katie, or sam mcgillaway on the show. I've decided that I really like fencing, and that at least at this early state I have a better mastery of the sport than most people in my class. I'm really thinking that this is going to be hard to to for twenty minutes. I miss my girlfriend. my ear itches. my roomate displaces much ground when he walks, or at least it sounds as if he does. I guess that's me thinking about my sensory preception. I hear him playing quake in the background, or should I say, behind my head. I wonder if I'll get full credit for my Diff EQ assignment. do teenage cats drink hairspray so their hairballs will look good?  always wondered that. it's amazing how well I can get my ideas to flow from my brain to my hands. I'm sure it's a combination of my typing savvy and my slowing of the thought process so I can type everything I think. my roomate's whistling the daily show theme. I like john stewart movies. I like patrick stewart movies. I wonder how many degrees it would take to connect him to kevin bacon. I wonder how I come up with connections like this. my Instant messanger sounds are starting to get on even my nerves. I wonder how I'll do this semester. I know the 0hrs of credit I got for spanish will help my ORGNAME, but will they offset the potential disaster that is either diff eq and or computer science 000?  do I really want to be a computer science major?  I really like cooking. BAM!. that's what emeril says. it's only been 0 minutes since I last looked at the clock, and that was maybe a total of 00 minutes ago. hmm. minutes and minutes were in the same position on those two lines. although they may not be when you read this. I wonder if my roomate's going to play the same song he always does. I miss home, mostly because of my girlfirend. I wonder if I'm supposed to put a comma in the name field. if obi wan kenobi has the ability to run with incredible speed, then why does he wait for the force field things to close and thus causing the death of his mentor. what's the deal with all the star wars major light sabre scenes (or most of them) ending with some guy falling down a large pit/shaft type thing?  is PROPNAME lucas trying to tell us something?  I can hear real songs in my roomate's playing. neither of us have been playing that long. I just showered, but my nose already feels oily. I think my leg's asleep. there's two asses in assassination. I think my whole leg is asleep, or getting there fast. I'm not used to sitting normally in my chair, but I did it to facilitate my typing. I wonder if facil or something like that is a latin root. spanish for easy is facil. facilitate means to make easy. makes sense to me. sounds like my roomate's trying to learn the solo to breakfast at tiffanie's. it's not that hard. I wonder if I'm catching mostly audio cues because my eyes are focused on a particular task?  that's my guess. well, that looks like about 00 minutes

__label__label1 so, what am I suppose to write about? I guess just anything huh. well , there are too much things for me to do this week, so many things. I have voluntary works to do, lots of school works are due by the end of the week, still lots of meetings for organizations and clubs. Also I have to work too. that takes up a lot of time, it seems like everytime there's a meeting they are all bunched together on Tue and Weds, which I can never attend because of work. Sometimes I really wonder if work is really that important that I have to make it all the time, it seems like no one really cares if you do show up or not, you just clock in and find something to do. I don't even have a real job to do yet, I've been doing a lot of different stuff, just wherever they need me. I don't even think the people there knows me at all. I'm pretty new so I guess after a while they will know me. I thought about just skipping work a couple times , but I think I better not. but after I show up to work , there's really nothing to do. they could handle the stuff without me, so then I feel like I should have just skipped work. I forot what time I started writing, I wonder how do they know how long I've been writing. oh , I just got something cool from my ra, and a call for me to go shopping and meet people, cool, so I guess I have to go even though I haven't been writing for twenty minutes, but this thing is pretty long already so I guess it won't matter that much. well, the more I look at it , it seems kinda short! well but I really have to go, what should I do??? YIkes, well I wonder if I can come back later and continue to write , but I don't think that's possible because that just voids the purpose of stream of con. for 00 minutes huh. but I really have to go. so I guess I'll cheat this time. but I'll write longer on the next assignment to make it up I guess. 
__label__label0 I am so tired of school already and I want to go home and sleep in my bed and see all of my old friends I hate computers with a passion my stupid ethernet does not work and the front desk says there is nothing they can do all I can do is to call a number which I have been doing and getting no answer ireally miss PROPNAME but he is coming to visit the weekend after labor day there are so many people fromschool in my psy class that I cannot stand and all of my classes area assignning so much reading for us if I read what I am suppose to I'd end up reading over threehundred pages a day and there is no way thatt is possible for me to do Biology is the worst class that I have the teacher is so boring and rambles on so fast which is really pathetic since bio is my major for the time being I have had the worst headache ever sonce I've been in LOCNAME I just want to go home for a while and have my summer back it was so much nicer not doing anything all day except for hanging out with friends and parting all night I wish we could smoke inside I am on the thirteenth floor which is a pain to wait for an elevator just to smoke and when it gets cold inthe winter its really going to suck ireally don't mind any of my classes except bio but what if I drop the major and it was just because of the  teacher from this yearwho ruined it for me when if I had another teacher I might have acctually enjoyed the subject I am so tired of reading maybe I'll switch my major to math that is so much easier for me but what can you do with math besides be a teacher I really don't want to be a teacher because I hate kids I never want to have kids they are such a pain I really   don't see why any one has them tons of my friends back home have them PROPNAME's kid is the devil himself he is so crazy and he's barely three I would not be able to raise another person for eightteen years straight  my head is really starting to pound everyone heere is trying to convince me to stop smoking but I think that would drive me insane and I'd be a really bitchy  person to everyone then I probally gian a ton of weight because if I am not somking  I am eating that's another problem with this whole college thing getting fat I was ten pounds lighter like six months ago and now if I gian any more I am going to go crazy maybe I should take metabolife pills but I don't feel like driving to the mall in rush hour traffic oh well iguess I'll just watch what I eat or at least try to  I really want charley to come to austin and visit soon he is the one person I really mis  since I've been gone thats weird cause I haven't missed my brothers at all  I never really got along with them any way maybe once we grow up we'll get along better  I don't really care now anyway my head hurts so bad I think I'll take a nap before I read ay of the billions of pages that I have for homework twenty minutes is over up all done with this one 
__label__label0 While sitting on my computer many thougts and feelings come into my head. I have now been at school for alsmost 0 weeks and I can't believe it. School is finally becoming a reality. It has just started to feel like home. I am from out of state and when I came to school I felt like I was at sleep a way camp trying to meet my friends for the next month. It is true I am not at camp anymore. It has been hard for me lately because I miss home. I miss my family and friends. It seemed to me at the beginning of school that everyone new each and I was the outcast. It has been hard finding friends even though everyone is very nice. It is different here because my closest friends aren't here with me. I came from a very close group of friends and we each went different directions. I am ready to meet new people but I want them to be like my best friends at home and that is not gooing to happen. I have to understand that I will become close to the people here at school I just have to give it time. I also miss my family tremendusly. I am very close to my family and try to talk to them at least once a day but talking is not the same a seeing them. It is very wierd not seeing my sister. We are 0 years apart but we are extremly close. Every time I talk to her I get a tear in my eye. The thought of not seeing her for another month makes me very upset. She told me the other day that she felt like I was on a trip and coming home. She tells me all the time how much she misses me and that makes the situation worse. I can't wait to see her and my parents. I have a very unique realationship with my parents. They are also like my best friends. I feel I can tell them anything. The are my inspiratin and my confindence in one. I have had a lot on my ming latly about school I am very nervous about all the work and tests. I feel as though it is going to be a lot harder that high school. It has been very hard to get back into the school mode but I am starting to get back in to it. I have had a lot of distractions latly with the sorority and and tring to meet eveyone to make friends but I realize I have to start putting school in front of all that. I am here for school and I need to start putting effort in to it. I am very dilgent and like to get my work done but I don't want to stress myself out. Even though school is very important I still need to have fun. I need to balence myself. I feel that it might take some time to get adjusted but it will all work out. School has definately been tough but it has resently gotten better and I know it will get better each day I am here. I am so glad that I made the decision to come to ORGNAME and experience this great school.       
__label__label1 My goodness, I have so much stuff to do. Where should I start?  I have to call about volunteering and for sure email PROPNAME to see if they have a Physical Therapy program at her hospital. How will I get this stuff done. I am torn as to whether or not to join a Fraternity. I think I will, I just hope I have time to get my studies done. As well as time to myself. I really need to get my bike back from PROPNAME's apartment. I'm sure it's getting to be a bit cumbersome there. Sometime tomorrow I have to find a way to get to the mall and buy some clothes. I need 0 ties, a new pair of khaki pants, some dress shoes and other miscellaneous things. I am so glad I changed my class schedule. It will be so much better this way. I am so stressed out about physics. I so hope I at least make a "B" in there. Pray, oh pray. I should make it to the ORGNAME Thursday evening and check that out. I am sure there are some good looking ladies there. I can't believe the Horns lost. What the heck?  To N. c. State. They better come back and win this week against ORGNAME. Actually we need PROPNAME back. Another thing is I need to wash my car. It's pitiful!  Definitely get the golf clubs out of my car. Or at least relocate them to a more convienient place. I seriously hope things go well with the Fraternity. I mean that is a lot of $$$. Campus looks nice tonite. I love the tower. I think I like college football way better than pro. It has so much more of an aura to it. The pros don't have any spirit. The college game is where it's at. I wonder where my roomate is. That punk never tells me when he's leaving. I still have to do the pretest. I tried, but it gave me some gateway server error message. I need to make sure and read for History and Government. I hope this Thursday schedule is going to work. I am starting to get a hint of missing my friends, but nothing like I thought it was going to be. Actually pretty good. Oh man, I just got an Instant Message. Oh well, I really need to finish this assignment. I kind of like this. Let's me get my feelings out. I need to find a Church for sure. I haven't been reading my Bible like I should since I got to Austin. I really need to work on that. I wonder what the rest of the year is going to be like. This move from a ORGNAME college is a bit extreme. Nothing like high school to college, but I went from a college with  0,000, to a college of 00,000. I probably have met 000 people so far. I am so terrible with names. I really need to work on that. My suite mates are being loud. Makes me not want to study. Or at least go elsewhere. I should probably check out the UGL or PCL anyway. I bet I could do a better job there in the first place. So what am I going to do this weekend?  It being Labor Day, I kind of have a choice. I might go to LOCNAME to visit my Sister or might stay and go to the lake with  PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I really miss my folks. Way more than I expected. I hope I get over it soon. I need to email some people and say hi before too much longer. I wonder what my new Physics prof is going to be like?  Good or Bad?  Nice or Unpleasant?  What?  I need to start praying more. Maybe that will help me with my confidence and focus. Whatever happens, I need to call PROPNAME tonite and line everything up for tomorrow night. This class schedule is going to be so much easier!  I love it!  No Friday school!  Three day weekends for a whole semester. I hope my ORGNAME classes aren't too strenuous all together. This is my first time to really balance 0 classes like that. 
__label__label0 It seems weird that PROPNAME is in the same philosophy class as me since we both live in the same neighborhood back in LOCNAME, even though we have never really met each tother before. She says she is planning to bvisit houston quite often, but I don;t think I will as often as her. Its not because I don't want to go home, but its partly that I feel independent here even though not monetarily. Also, I would like to get the chance to vistit austin and get to know m y surrounding before going back to the norm and comfortableness of my true home; austin is my new temporary home. PROPNAME said he missed home the very first day; I don;t think I really miss home that much, maybe because of the contradictory or hyppocritical views I sometimes have of things in houston. I wonder if my schedule conflict involving ba000 will be settled with out further conflict; I can't afford to miss psychology atfor ba000 once a month, yet I cannot afford to lose sight of ba000. Hopefully, this PROPNAME or brian character will be able to sufficinetly change my course schedule since tex won't allow me to do it any more. It seems that I got a lot to do today, yet at the moment it doens't seem as anything is concrete, expect some homework arbitrarily. Its only been 0 minutes and its seems as though I have been typing at leat twice that long. I wonder how my mind will wonder to the next stream of unconsciousness. Philosophy seems to be an interesting class even though the reading is quite strenuous. PROPNAME must have been the master at breaking people's arguments; he would have been a great attorney or lawyer. Which reminds me, what exactly is the difference between a lawyer and an attorney? Perhaps its in how they represent people or their specific type or level of education concerning the law. The damn ethernet guy better at least give me a ring and try to help me fix the connection that was working until last thursday or so, I have called and left a message three times already and no response. Does he live in Dobie or just has a similar prefix to his phone #. Once I get the ethernet working, I won't have to come here to this computer lab and worrying abut forgetting to tyupe in my IF account #. Almost all the peoplke I have talked ot about this labor day weekend have said they will be travelling back to home; most of my friends are those from my high school, we probably are at least 00 people representing cy falls. I would like to play a pick up game with PROPNAME and see how much he has improved since the days he was with theh cypress falls basketball program. I bet jimmy is trying to get accustomed to his new surroundings at that junior college, which I can't recall the name to. PROPNAME's sister basically got the dusch from that jeff punk, I don';t think I would have confessed seeing another woman unless she was going to find out regardless; better from me than from a stranger. Unlike the infamous PROPNAME situation, Only five more minutes until I can check my mail; hopefully, somebody that is not attending LOCNAME will have written me to see how everything is going or the Panhellenic council will have finally decided to start their opening meeting. How many Greeks, true Greeks/ Hellenas , not fraternity or soririty people, are amognst me at UT. Maybe I will meet some good looking girls. I knew it was PROPNAME as soon as I saw at the ORGNAME meeting; haven't seen her since the days at TGHP. ITs weird that she knows Amber, the girl I kind of hooked up with at one fo the LOCNAME in 00, so long ago. Its alomsst time and I just read the click once to submit  button while awaiting the time to log off this thing. Only a few more minutes ; my wrist are beginning to sweat opn this uncomfortable keyboard. I keep wanting to type with my left ring finger because it feels liek it needs to be streched or so. Time.

__label__label0 Right now I am thinking about what all my friends are doing. I just finished emailing them for the first time since I figured out how to do email in the computer lab. Its wierd being away from home. But I've decided I fel only as if I am away to cheerleading camp and its just a little longer that it normally is. I am loving college life so far. I feel like I've been managing my time fairly well, but I get annoying constantly when I feel somewhat disorganizee. There is a lot to remember and things that I guess we are supposed to know as freshamn that I have no clue about. I just joined a sorority and I am stating to realize how time- demanding it is. But my grades are far more important to me. I am nervous about my classes because in high school I was used to A's (except in chemistry). I am hopefully going to tranfer from engineering to business possible business honors if I do well enough so I want to do really well. I have been doing my readings, but I was never the best test taker. I am not used to the big classes, and tey make me uncomfortable thats why I would love to be in an honors program where the classes are smaller. I am the type of student who likes to have a perwsonal relationship with my teachers, and I don't feel like I can approach them in such a large setting. People who know me find this to be odd because I am nortmally quite outgoing no matter the situation. Today during class, we talked about how a majority of first year students go through depression. I think I've been trying to avoid it by keeping very busy, but I guess I somewhat am. I miss my family and my best friend vera at southwest. I even miss my teachers aned my old high school. AT my high school everyone knew who I was and rspected me, or looked up to me in a way. I was a cheerleader, and the top of my class. Here I'm just a number. But I'm the type of person who likes challenges, so I don't think its depression. I just look at this experience as another challenge to face in order to achieve success at a higher level. My classes and teachers are all really good- which I expected since I spent a majority of orientation researching them. I just hope I have success in all my classes. I would really love to go home at Christmas with  a 0. 0 which I don't think is completely unreasonable. A lot of people are counting on me to do well, my parents, my family (0 younger brothers and sisters), my extended family. Its almost stressful. There is so much to do hre in LOCNAME. It is fun but I will need to prioritize Sun-Thur. Its wierd not having anyways to tell you what to do, or when to do it. But its also nice to not have the responsibility of 0 other family memebers. I always had to make sure I didnt need t0o help my parents with  driving, babysitting, or house work before I got to do any of my own things. They definelty relied on me less second semester which was really cool of them. I have much more free time then last year too because I ony have to worry about myself (that sounds selfish) but I don't need to check up on 0 other peoples lives before I take care of my own business. Of coure, I still make it my business to know what they are doing because our family life was gret. There are so many personalities. We are all so unique, and it was definetly a challenge learning how to cope and adapt to each one. I think my parents are stil having fun doing it- I bet theyre glad to have gotten rid of one- but at the same time they miss me - I know. I think I have the best parents ever. They love me so much!!!!   
__label__label1 Honestly, right now that I have this assignment all I can think about is what to write about. I wonder and wonder what I'm thinking but all I can think about is that I want to get this done because if I don't I will eventually get behind and then I;ll never catch up and everyone will be able to go out and have fun while I sit at home and do my computer assignments for this class. I guess all and all that translates to me being scared of what I am and am not doing. I sit in my room a lot and think about all the assignments I need to do and all the things I have to do but I never quite get the innitiave to do them until it is the last minute. I am so scared that I am going to fail now that I am here because I don;'t quite think that I belong hwere. Everyone else seems so smart and like they belong here and I am the black sheep. It scares me that everyone seems to have all of these friends already and I don't I just miss my friends that I had in high school. It is different here, no one is the same and maybe they are and I have just changed. I wonder how long it will take for me to fit in like everyone else seems to. My roommate and I have been friends since like the second grade, so I didn't get to meet anyone new when I moved into the dorm. It scares me to even be in the dorm because I am more homesick than I ever would have imagined being. I miss my parents and my friends and my pets and my room. I only live 00 miles away but I worry that I will look pathetic if I go home all the time, but I so much want to pack m0y  stuff up every few days walk a mile and a half to my car on the side of the road and head back to PROPNAME. There is absolutely nothing special there, but I miss it so much. My parents say come home anytime you want but do they feel ashamed when I do as if they didn't raise me well enough to make it on my owm. I also feel bad because I don't have a jobn yet, I have never gone without a job, I've continuously had a job for the past two years and now my parents are paying my way and is that fair, they shoudln;'t ghave to I'm a bigt girl I should be paying for my own things, this isn't fair to them. I feel so dependent on them aNED ALL through high school I felt so dependent and now that I should even more, I don't at all. I don;t even know why I chose this school, I think it is becuase everyone thought that I couldn't and I wanted to prove them wrong but that syhouldn't of veen the reason. I am happy tht I am here now because I think it is a good school but I didn't have good reasons when I applied and I worry that will effect my future here. I feel lonely being here. My friends are at other schools in LOCNAME and I still have some in PROPNAME but I feel like I am here all by myself and no one sees me as good enough to be freinds with. I feel like everyone already has their groups and I just don't fit into them. Today is the best that I habe felt in a long time becausr my friend PROPNAME is coming by from ORGNAME ORGNAME's and her being here might make me feel like I have someone. I don't know why her being here would do that, but just maybe it might. Every time I sit outside I see people being picked up to go do things and I jsut sit outside by myself smoking my Marlboros wondering when I will have someone coming to pick me uyp,. Maybe that will mak e me look important but why do I care what these people think, even when they see me in the hall they don't know who the hell I am anyway, I think I want them to though. Maybe then I would feel as if I was a part of the university. Right now I feel like a blacksheep and I have never in my life felt like that. Is there a reason why these people look at me odd, why do they not make efforts to speak to me or why do I not make efforts to speak to them. I guess I have a fear of them not accepting me therefore I don't even make the effort to approach them. IS the chance of rejection worth the effort on my part. But then aGAIN maybe they want send me signs of rejection, maybe they will see that maybe I am a good person and then I would fit in, but what are the chances of that happening. (I feel so dumb writing this becuase I don't say what I feel ever. My mother thinks that I am like in the fact that instead of being honest and admitting how I feel, I create a front and never say what makes me happy, sad, angry, etc. Instead I act like I don't care either way  and go home or whereever noone is at and cry in private. If no one sees me cry then no one knows how to push my buttons and if you never let anyone in then you never get hurt. Only one of my really close friends knows that I do this, but that could lead to me only having one really good friend. But I don't think so becuae I love my friends and they love me no matter what so if they really knew who I was then they wouldn't care. It wouild probably be a relief to them becuase then they wuold know that I was human. Not that they think I'm, not but I don't show feelings so they wonder what I am really thinking, but if I tell people whta I really think then I open myself up way too much for dissappointment. I don;'t know what to do, I htink that is why I haven't gone home because if I am stuck here with all my feelings then eventually I will have to open up and let people in and if I run home every other day, I will have too much security and I will think that I can remain closed to new things forever. THis way I am forced to accept myself and that way I can find out if people accept me. 
__label__label1 Ugh! Look how nasty and scary that thing is. How stupid he was to stay in the car with that object? Well this a very scary movie, and the only I have seen in a log while, its my roomates faults. Oh, she is a traitor, how about that, never thought it would be her. Isn't there better ways to express your feelings, instead of cussing. The monster got her how gross, and what a painful death. It must of hurt, duh, and the guy trying to save should of just left before he became a victim too. Again another ironic thing the teams leader is who never suspected. Her naked body proves it, why is he so crazy to believe her words. Words speak louder than actions. Look how she transformed her body and the other one is one of her. Man, boy I am getting really frightened of this. My body has chills has the end is narrowing. I have an itch behind my ear,on my leg, foot and head I think due to the fact that I am so scared of the movie and the events that are about to happen. My eyes are widening due to the good guys escape. My head itches more. Yeah he made it I'm happy for. There is one for the good guys. 
__label__label1 I am very famished right now. I just got back from the psychology class. My stomach is gnawing, and I feel the grinding emotions. I haven't been very energetic the whole day. I almost fell asleep in my calculus class today. This is terrible, because I have never really gotten that tired in high school before. It always just seemed to be the calculus class that I almost fall asleep in. I am very frustrated at school. It is not only that I am a freshman, and that I am still trying to adjust to college life, but it is also due to my classes. For example, I have a biology class, with an excellent professor. However, his teaching assistant is making me really upset, because he can't really speak english. He is Indian, and I am sure he must be very intelligent, but I cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. I understand him on that basis, because I am after all a foreign student, and 0 years of high school have really changed my speaking capabilities. But I guess the older one gets, the harder it is for them to learn and adapt to new things. Anyway, I was vexed too, because he would not explain the questions asked by himself, but he would ask the class to input their answers. I understand that he wants the class to participate as a whole, but he can't just rely on students' answers. After all, we are just as confused. Math class is almost the same, except my math teacher speaks better than him. But Math has always been a tough area of subject for me. I have a bad history of math, and therefore I think that class is prone to my exhaustion. My professor is explaining math thoroughly, and he is very helpful and good, but my dislike for math overcomes me. I know that it is mind over matter, and that if I try to psyched myself to like math, I could probably get to put my energy into it. Don't get me wrong. I have always been a good student. I was valedictorian of my high school, and my high school is one of the best in LOCNAME. However, there are always some flaws even to the perfect, because no one is infallible, and I tend to procrastinate. This in the end results in my fears now. I am getting so nervous every day, because I am behind in my reading of assignments, and I am   worried that some professors are going to spring out pop-quizzes on me. I  also noticed that I not only tire so easily now, but my attention span has also increased, and my thoughts wander so much to the insignificant matter. I can't seem to concentrate reading in my room, when all the food, bed, noises, and I guess everything seems to distract me. Also, I have never been in a relationship before, not even dating, and in college, I thought it is where one may start for me. I often find myself looking out for guys. Even if I do get into one, I am sure that I will not do anything to jeopardize my future. I really want to be a doctor, and I am right now very worried about medical school. I really want to enter ORGNAME, and I am rather mad that they deferred me during early decision, and didn't admit me during spring decision. I guess I am being irrational here, but I did harbor the hope that I could get in because of the deferral. But that stumbling block will not trip me, I will still continue to work hard in college, get out with a 0. 0 ORGNAME, and hopefully a high ORGNAME score, and hope that I can apply to ORGNAME and get into med school. That would be a very nice, ultimate dream that I would ever want to fulfill. I am very hungry right now, and I am having a major headache trying to think if I should double major in something, because it is not wise just to major in biology, and think that everything including medical school will be smooth for me. I think I will visit my advisor on Friday.     
__label__label0 I wonder what I am doing right now, this is a little annoying, stupid grammer mistakes are irritating me. Hmmm, I hope that PROPNAME likes the present that I have for her. How am I going to get back, and how am I going to get back? How much will it cost, how will I do on my psychology test I have the coming monday. I hope that I will still have time to study. Oh well, I'm tired I really wish I didn't have to do this right now. Hehehe, I wonder if that guy I just e-mailed will reply to me anytime soon, and I wonder if he'll actually have what I want. How much will the new motherboard I need cost? Can I wait 0 months? I hate waiting, oh well. I wonder if PROPNAME is asleep right now, I really do miss her. Atleast I'll get to see her when I go back for her birthday next week. This is really going to take a long time to do, the writing assignment I'm doing right now. Havnt' played pool in a while, I hope that I'm still decent. What's on the TV right now and why am I paying so much attention to the way that I'm typing right now, I keep going back and making corrections to my mistakes when it already said I shouldn't. Bad habit I guess, always want everything to be perfect. Dumb Browser, messing up. Annoying sound. I hope that when I go to Block-buster tomorrow they will Final Fantasy VIII. I wonder if it will be as good as it's supposed to be. I hope that I do good in college, get goood grades and do well in general, though I also hope that I have fun also. It's a bit anoyying having to think and type so fast at the same time oh well. I have to do it for my assignment. The TV is really loud and annoying right now, unfortunately my roommate is watching it right now and I'm doing thing right now so I can't stop and turn it down or anything. I like my roommate pretty much we get a long pretty well, but anyways why am I thinking ORGNAME this, never knew that my mind switched from thoughts so suddenly. I wonder if I have attention defecit disorder. I hope now, that would be really bad, though that might explain why I never really did as well as my brother or sister in school. I wonder what they are doing now. I wonder if they've ever drunk alcohol. Anyways, that's none of my bussiness. Hmmmmm. I wish I didn't have to go to school tomorrow, wish I could just stay home and just rest and enjoy myself. I sill need to do my calculus, philosophy, and psychology. The other part of it atleast. It's a little difficult right now with all these distractions, but I guess I'll cope. Hmm. don't really know what to think about or write about right now. Hmm I wonder how much my plane ticket will cost when I buy it, I hope it doesn't cost too much. But it's for her, so I guess it's worth it. Wish I could see her right now. I rememver the first time I saw her, it was a little strange and I didn't know her name. hehehe. she was cute, nice to look at and she was nice  too. anyways I'd better stop thinking about her and get my mind on some work. Another thing I wonder how I'm going to pay for my plane ticket I still havn't recieved my bank card or checking card from ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Annoying. Hmmm. Those funyons look good right now, I wonder if I should stop right now and eat some food. I wonder if the milk is still good, or if it's bad now. I'm in the mood for some cereal right now, kinda wierd. But I've always been a little wierd. Anyways this is getting rediculous and a bit tedious also on my fingers. getting tired from just looking at the screen right now and typing. oh well. how much longer is it, oh  0 minutes. I guess that's not too bad. Hmmm. I want to stop. anoyying. oh well. aonly a little longer. I'm starting to get careless. but anyways. I wish PROPNAME would stop messaging me right now I'm trying to do this but I can't with him messageing me. TV is getting louder right now, must be some horror movie or something. too bad I can't turn around to look right now and type the same cause it would be a little difficult to do so right now while typing and having to occasionally look at the keyboard to make sure I don't mess up. I wonder if my fingers look wierd right now moving in this order. Oh well, who cares. Only 0 more minutes till I can stop and maybe either rest and sleep or eat some more food. Now what will I eat, cereal, hamburger??? who knows. I wonder how much I've typed already. Hopefully I typed a lot cause it would be cool if I would type really fast. One more minute right now. Why do I always put more periods than I need to???? I always do that with just about everything. but again who cares. Finally time is up!!!!!!!! 
__label__label1 I really wish that I could get on to the psychology pretesting page to get it over with but I've tried three times and it won't let me on. It's really driving me crazy. I feel like I have so much stuff that I need to get done right know, but if I space it out I can get it done. I need to learn to manage my time a little better. It was easy to do everything at the last minute in high school, but I'm in college know and I need to keep up with my assignments. I'm sure other people are feeling the same as me. If I could get everything done in one day I would feel so relieved, but I have to much to do in one day. My two other friends, live in an apartment, and there so boring. All they do is  sit at home all day and watch TV. I wish that they would go and do something, but if I asked them to do something they would probably do it. But, I just haven't asked. I'm still adjusting to moving. I come from a really small town, of about 0000 people, and I am overwhelmed at the amount of people that are here. I don't know where anything is at and I need to get my driver's license renewed, it has been expired for almost 0 months. One of my other friends goes to LOCNAME in LOCNAME. She says it is really hard and maybe she will transfer to LOCNAME next semester or year. That would be great for me, then I would know someone else here at the school. The chairs in the compurter lab are to close together. You can't move without hitting another chair. They need to spread them out. I want to go out one weekend and do something but I don't know  very many people here and I don't want to impose on anyone and just ask them if I can tag along. They probably would'nt mind. I think I am going to go home this weekend. My mom really gets on my nerves, or she did this past weekend. I  think it was because I was really tired. I really don't like going home because it is really boring and everyone just sits at this store called short stop. What Fun!!!!  I would rather sit at home and watch TV. I want to go and get my hair cut and highlighted and start going to a tanning bed but it always feels like I don't have enough time in the day. I know that I really do I just don't go get it done. I am really tired right know. I went to bed really late last night and had to get up early but I can't take a nap because I need to finish my  homework that I should have already finished. I also have to do my laundry. This chair is really comfortable though. I could fall asleep just sitting here. I hate paying for the copies that I make. I wish I had my own computer in my dorm room so that I wouldn't have to pay for them at all. It's a pain not having your own computer. I had to leave my at home so that my sister could use it if she needed. My parents said I could bring it but I'm in a supplementary room right now and didn't want to. My mailbox doesn't work and neither does our phone jack. I have two roommated, PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I am supposed to get a check in the mail but it is not here yet and it was mailed on the 00 of August. but I guess it really doesn't matter since I can't get teh mailbox open yeat. I hope that no one else got my check because that would really suck. I could really use the money being here in LOCNAME there is a lot of stuff I could buy. Especialy with all teh stores around here. I really want some khaki pants without the creases in the front and some capri pants. I'm getting tired of doing this but since I have to do it I have to continue writing. Wait, my bad it has been over 00 minutes. I have been writing to long. About 0 minutes to long so I'll be going know. Bye!! 
__label__label0 Austin is very different from my home town. I live in a small town about 00 miles south of LOCNAME called LOCNAME. It has only 0000 people in the whole town. Everywhere you go you run into someone you know. Austin is so big and when I meet people I wonder if I will ever see them again, but so far I have seen a lot of people I have met. I live in PROPNAME and I have met a lot of girls in my dorm that are really nice. I like the LOCNAME campus too. It is not to spread out although I do have to walk a lot to get to my classes. That is ok because I can use the exercise. This psychology class and my chemistry class have over 000 people in it. That was very overwhelming for me but I have adjusted somewhat. Today I was walking on the drag and saw so many people out and about for the game. It is the first game of the season and I'm very excited. There are so many people that used to go to school here or are just big Longhorn Fans. They are all dressed in orange and many have their kids with them and even the kids are dressed in orange and white. It is really neat to see so many supporters and fans of the school and the football team. I am really excited about the game. I hope we beat LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. It seems so weird that I can consider myself as "we" or part of the UT traditon, atmospere, and college!  I hear we have the number one recruiting team in the nation. That is cool because these are people the same age as me. I met one of the new recruits the other night. He was huge and I'm sure he plays on defense. He sure didn't look like a freshman!!  As you can tell I like football. I think a lot of that has to do with the time of year. Probably also because my dad was a high school football coach and I've grown up with it all my life. Also I was a cheerleader in high school and I miss cheering a little, so I always look forward to a football game. That is probaly why I am so excited about the game today. It is amazing to me that so many other people feel the same way about football. I also am excited about the game because it will be fun to learn the UT traditons and meet new people. Well my 00 minutes is up. I hope I wrote enough but I just don't type very fast so it takes me awhile to type out what is on my mind. 
__label__label0 Hi, I have no idea what I'm going to write but who cares, here goes. I'm right now sitting in a small computer lab down in the base ment of LOCNAME West, across the where I now reside, in Jester LOCNAME, doing a writing assignment for Psychology on what comes in to my mind first. Well, my mind is filled with stuff that's definitely not very much to do with a psychological sense. I've been away from books and studying for 0 0/0 years now, and 0 week into ORGNAME and 0 classes and 00credit hours later, myhead is sent reeling from the amazing amount of work that I have to do right now. I've totally forgotten everything to do with math and calculus is being thrown onto me at an amazing speed and at an extreme difficulty for me to comprehend. Basically, travelling halfway round the world to get hit with books that send you into unconsciousness is definitely not the nicest feeling to have at the moment. And the books. i have never seen paper cost so much in my entire life! Damn, now I know why americans are so rich. Nah, it's all understandable to me, it's just the matter of settling down into a different environment, and making myself a new circle of friendsfrom scratch. Not much in my mind now but complaints and angst now I guess, but it'll be definitely back to my books right after I complete this assignment, and maybe the next. Thoughts, Ithink that's been settled for now. et's get on to feelings. Well I'm feeling hot and bothered right now because we just had a fire drill, I thihnk, I did'nt exactly see any fire and we were allowed back into the building, just a while ago and had a thousand annoyed beings buzzing around the side of the building trying to comprehend in our little minds what the heck is going on here, hwo's the joker who pulled the alarm or wave his stupid little lighter flame below the automatic sensor??Jerk!  Now, let's get on to sensations. Hmm, seems kinda wierd to me what this means. Sends the little runners in my itsy brain go wandering all over the place and the component called imagination into overdrive. Nah, no dirty thoughts here, it's an educational institution. that's what they all say anyway. Well, my senses are kinda dulled right now. A result of chatting last night with my roommate till 0am and waking u p this morning at 0. damn, really hate early mornings, I'm not a morning type of guy but apparently all my classes start way too early in the morning. Calculus at that, is that a classic example of stress or what. But what better way to start the ol thinker working everyday with symbols and numbers geting thrown at me and expecting me to understand what's going on?? Really don't know actually. don't really care. i guess that's it 00 minutes, mebbe a bit less. tata! 
__label__label1 Ok I suppose I should start typeing er typing I mnean er mean that is typo but that is ok, there are no backing up er is. Wow, I cannot think I am supposed to do this until the end but I don't want to be late for computer science across the way I wonder who has to read this, and all the other 000 entries and if they ever think "How tedious" but I digress. Not actually that that means anything, but I thought it so I should write it, correct? Yeah. Good ska is hard to find. i need music to keep me up. my sound system makes me forget my problems I don't need to think about Like being dropped from journalism, not that seeing my ex-girlfriend helped any. The only analogy is like a nailbomb going off inside my head today. I am kind of stressed, but that is what everybody will write, right? Hey, I can rhyme. I need to write lyrics for the songs for The Pinfields. Not that I have the time. even tho I should be calling work and this feels like a waste of time because it doesn't seem like work, it seems like emailing a friend or some such nonsense. Its not that, but I don't know. If I keep typing, what will it get?  I don't make sense. Shit, I am tired. I need to schedule my life away to keep up, not that she has any problems or anything. I need to stop worrying about myself. I need to look at the others and help. I don't care but apathy is bad so I do. I hate something or another. I have too many bad habits. I I I me me me. God, I am such a fucking self centered dork. I hope I don't offend anyone. Not that that matters. I need to call work, get a vcr, get a couch. Go to ben's. that's right. WHat time is it. 0000. that means 00 minutes Until I haul ass to computer science. I am not that deep of a person I suppose. i wonder if I can make it as a lyricist. did PROPNAME gfet my email? I don't know. Argh. At least (ergh I mean) this music is good. THis is bad posture and I don't need this towel. I am trying to focus on the black circle (or dot) in my head because I made it up as a way to not let over-analyzing everything drive me crazy and found out it was actually a technique for relaxation. crazy. But I don't think that that is something. I need everything to just wait 0 day so I can calm down. BUt Oh god. I have 00 hours. THey dropped me. I am screwed. Now I'm on the waiting list. i ll call mom. She'. l. tell me what I can do. Not that I depend on people too much. I think in phrases don't I? I wonder if I use question marks in my head. Almost there. No poem, no artistic expression. Just my usual moronic behavior. God. I am such a selfcentered loser. I am not as good as anybodY. The tape ended. I try to make it so I think everyone is equal, but I can't. I end up making myself think I am lower just to compsensate. God. I need to find religion. I need to stop complaining. I need to chill . I I I me me me. I need to shut the hell up. I just need to calm down. I need to leave. I need to get a bike. when I am going to get the stiff on my room down. I am tiared. Am I hungry?  I don't think so. I don't want to eat. well now that I dwell on it. a little bit. That cool. The way the light is regfelected on the mirror on my wall. No gramm ar or punctuation. Not important. Is it 00:00? no. 0000. er 00. changed. God. Is it? I nedd to clean this palce up. All the thoughts that run through my head. "mirror in the bathroom please don't freak. The door is locked just you and me let me take you to a restaurant thats got glass tables we can watch ourself while you are eating" ugh sleep I need sleep. Sleep is god. I don't want to offend god tho. I think I've don e enough to wanyway. no I need to not ERGH ergh that s just it ergh ergh ergh ergh ergh ergh ergh Vent Don't break stuff. Remember the door. Remember the wall and the shattered glass. bleeding. No. ergh. Bad. Violence isn't the answer but neither is self blaming. BUT peopple can blame me without any second thought. How does that work. I should leabve. I dislike everything. I am. NOt I like no wait how uh ergh. monosylabic just don't work because I just don't quit this shit is aurally aesthetic kind of like a prescription from a stressed medic. Fin. 
__label__label0 well after being the first day of school, I really wonder how much harder the clsses will be. astronomy seems easy enoughas it is intended for non-science majors. but dr. pennebaker said that the class wouldbe hard. Doing assignments are no problem but I worry about the test. like what am I going to make?  will I get an a?  will my parents ever get off my back. I dunno. I'm also concerned about labor day and this weekend like whter or not I shouyld go home to go the wedding or do I not want to see my parents my suitemate is going to get hammered as she puit it just a minute ago on a wednesday night!  for goodness sake why do our parents pay 00,000 a year for their kids to fail out of college?   that is so weird anyways I think drinking is bad foryou but I only like to drink winecooolers because they taste good I wonder whether or not I should sratch my foot it itches my typing has gotten really really really really badly anyways my tummy hurts and I have to see the gyno on monday about menstrual cycles from the looks of it college is not going to be as funas most people make it out to be I mean aren;t you supposed to party?  but all I do is study I need to change this mp0 this song is annoying now I'm listening to creep by radiohead is makes me a little depressed and I think that my roomate is making microwave mac and cheese I like my new diet but it seems like no one ever believes it but I have lost 00 lbs so that is something I think I'll get up at 0 to workout tomorrow anouther mile will be good I wonder if michelle is really going to read this?  MICHELLE!  HEY!  read me!HELP ME!  I need to make good grades so I can get a phd too with a lot of work and time and stress though!  I want to take sign language too!  so I can talk to deaf people about their problems. I'm sure they have them too!  I also want to open a place called the de-stresser. I could counsel people while in other rooms of the building there will be stress reliving rooms such as a sauna, pool, coffee place, and a massage therapy place amd even better a laser tag or virtual reality hunting game. hm. my bf is msging me on icq I just told him that I'll answer in 0 mins  I hate history classes what a perfect soul what you should know I'm not around so special I wish I was special but I'm a creep io'm a weirdo but how much can I take I don't belong here oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh. this song is getting on my nerves what about an areosmith song?  cheese and mac smells good!  pink is my new obessseion pink is not even a question pink is my favortie pink its the color of passion cause today its in fashion pink it was love at sight pink its time to turn out the light!  you could be my famingo cause pink is a new kinda lingo pink like an umbrella pink that you could never tell  you pink it was love at first sight pink when I turn out the light pink gets me high as a kite!   
__label__label1 today was a pretty lousy start. last night matt and I talked about alchoholfor  about two hours. he needs lots of help.

__label__label1 Will I survive? That is what I am thinking about right now. I am here because someone gave me money to live in this dorm, go to classes, and actually learn about something that will be of value to my self and my community. Pressure. Everyone is depending on you. focus, is what I need ot keep sstudying and do homework every night. there is Spanish, Math which I already should know because I took calculus and made an A except I didnt remember a thing. I slacked off my senior year and abondoned my whole work ehtic. Sad, for me, because staring over is a pain. How ami going to make my lazy but become dedicated to my sutdies again? I am still dizzy from my long 00 hour nap. I want to shut out the world and just go to sleep, but that is too easy. How will I survive, how will I support my family? No, I wont sleep. I will finish this writing assignment. Then finish my pre-clculus, aftter that Spanish, then I will read my psychology book. My wrists are starting  to hurt a little. I have not typed in such a while. it feelslike theyre going to go stiff on me like the way they do when I'm doing curls and I can't make another rep. Today is chest day. I have tofollow this new workout program called periodization. I'm kind of hesitant because it seems like I will be losing some of my hard gain that I have achieved. PROPNAME gym sucks. Its always so crowded so how am I supposed to get a good waorkout? on the other hand the female persuasion is very represented. But that si also a distraction. Boy I have 000 dollars to live on for the next 0 months and I am worried that I might starve or something. I hate being hungry. it is the worst feeling ever. I could never be homeless. It is too hot inTexas to be abeggar. Iwould haveto move to LOCNAME or somewhere cooler. poor homeless people! Well my back is starting to hurt on my right side. I think it is because of the way that I slept. since I've been here all I do is listen to music that I slisstened to back home. 
__label__label0 Upon coming to UT I thought about it in much detail. Being used to air conditioned High School, I told my roommate that I think that the entire university should be one building. This building would have to be about 000 stories high, or remain the same size, just in a huge bubble. Now that class has started, I see that the temp. problem is not that big of a deal, so I say screw it. I also thought class would be easier. Since there aren't any daily grades, quizes, or numerous tests, I find it difficult to be happy with my current state of mind concerning my academics. I constantly feel that I need to study. I find this extremely difficult lately now that the fraternity has us running around with little time for relaxation. Thank goodness they allow us study time. I don't know much about college life yet because I haven't been through at least one semester yet, but I don't think engineering will be as easy as I had hoped. The math concerning the major is so overwhelming that I find myself with extremely high levels of anxiety while attending the class. The TA teaches on tues. /thurs. and then I have a supplemental instruction class too. If it wasn't for the GE (supplemental) class I don't think I would be able to cut it. I came out of high school thinking that math was just natural, but I realize that the quality of teachers makes all the difference in the world. I realize how jaded the topics I discuss are and also want to mention that I am extremely frustrated with the entry level professors (I'm really just dirrecting my anger towards the math department). The guy barely speeks english and he basically stands at the front of the class and puts on a display of how good he is at math. "OOH, look at me I'm Romanian and I know lots of math; you can never know as much math as me. To make sure you never know as much math as me I'm going to run though this matterial so quickly that none of you can process it and assign you so much homework that with my shortcummings as a teacher, you with surely sit for hours trying to figure out this stuff on your own. "  I am obviously dramatizing the situation, but this is the only way I can describe my frustration; however there is some truth to my insanity. 
__label__label0 Well, I'm confused with my computer, its unusually working slowly and it freezes a lot. I gave my computer to my friend PROPNAME who fixed the major problem of it. When I turned my computer on it would never load windows and the start up menu would appear. I thought that he broke it because he came from UH up here last week and he clocked my computer from 000MHz to 000MHz. After he left and I tried my computer it would not load Windows and the start up menu would always appear. So this labor day weekend I came home, my parents were shocked to see me because I forgot to tell them that I was coming. But they were happy and kept asking me how college is and giving me tips of not goofing around too much. I also went to eyemasters in West oaks mall there I was very shocked to see my friend PROPNAME who is now a junior in high school but I still think of her as a freshmen because shes like a little sister to me. Everyone thinks she's very gorgeous I now think so too because I never thought of her that way. Anyways she told me her brother was getting her a job there because he works there. But she told me she didn't want to work there because her brither is there and she has to act a certain way and I know what she means. Her brother PROPNAME is huge, he's probably 00 yrs old and he goes to UH. Well, I saw her there but I didn't say much, it was really busy I wish I could talk to her but I just said something on the lines of "nice to see you, well bye" I went to eyemasters to get nose pads for my glasses. I use those glasses to play basketball with. But I saw prescription goggles there and that's what I've been looking for, they costed one hundred dollars though, I'll probably get them with my work study money, once I start recieving it. Yeah, I work at PROPNAME hall and I the Jester media center ehich is upstairs. PROPNAME PROPNAME is my boss and he's really cool. He smokes and curses and is a gradute  of LOCNAME with a 0. 00 ORGNAME!!  I really hope I do well in my first year at LOCNAME, my classes aren't extremely hard, but everyones like college is nothing like high school its very hard. Actually I see college as not hard but just a level. You have so much free time, you are 00% of the time out of class. So there;s a lot of time to study an make good grades. The bad part is you can never slack off more than a couple of times, and that's where I see people make their mistakes, I've seen and heard of so many people I know do very bad with horrendous GPA's and I don't understand. Do these people realize how lucky they are to be in college? To improve on certain skills to make incredible amounts of money. Most do but some idiots don't and that's why there all crying by their junior or senior years in college hen they realize they should have chosen their books most of the time over their friends. I know I barely studied and still got good grades in high school, but I know college is a lot different. I have to manage my time wisely and study and do homework all the time and everyday, then goof around over the weekends whenever I surely have free time. Well, my twenty minutes are up. 
__label__label0 I am in the library trying to get my work done but I keep on thinking on what else o need to do. I hope I get adjusted to college life quicker so I will not be as stressed out as I am now. I am going home next weekend to see my family and all of my friends, I hope that they are all doing well. Some of my classes are pouring down on the homework and I am getting more worried as the days go by. tomorrow I have to essays due for one of my classes and I kind of do not understand them. I will be glas after I take my first tests and ace them all. Everybody was telling me that college will be hard if you get caught up in all of the other activities, so I am trying to stay focused on my studies rather than on extra things. I have been sleeping late and getting up early so I am tired for class but I have to force myself to stay awake and focus. After I am done writing this essay I have to start doing all of my other work so I can beat the deadlines and not wait until the last minute. When I get home I have to go to the gym and workout, orgainize my room and then cook myself some dinner. I have to watch what I eat or else I will put on weight and not be healthy. That will affect my studies and others. I hope that my family is doing well because I know that my mom is having a hard time letting me go to college because we were alone together for four years while my sisters were away at college. She already has a stressful life working 00 hours a week, driving home 00 minutes each day in traffic and then coming home and cooking for my sisters and me. I can just pray that she is not taking it to hard and will realize that this is something that I have to do. When I get out of college I hope to accomplish many of my goals that I have set for myself. Like having a great job that will pay me good money because of my great ORGNAME, making a nice happy home with kids and a beautiful wife and doing anything that my family needs. I hope the relationship that I am in with this girl lasts for a lifetime because we are so good together and we love each other a lot. I am greatly attached to my girlfriend and I hope that I will be able to have her as my beautiful wife and have great children with her. I will see what happens through college and hopefully everything goes well. 
__label__label0 The day has flown by, work computer science homework, but it was a nice day, I was wearing black which was dumb because the sun was shining and it was really hot. U know about how black seems to attract the most colors or that the most colors get absorbed so it actually makes everything hotter. Plus I was wearing jeans which made it worse, I would have actually preferred to wear shorts but going to work on the first day wouldn't have been smartest with dressing so casually know what I mean? but anyways  back to the point. I met some interesting people today. I talked to PROPNAME for a while actually only a couple of sentences I had to go soon. but I wanted to go to the TA to see if he can help me with my cs homework turned out he wasn't there. don't know where he went. but I don't care tho. actually I did, u know how things seem to be worse when nothing seems to be going ur way? well it's almost quiet right now, I think the crickets are chirping which is horrible because its really annoying. typically I'm not a violent person. but it's something about crickets. I have no idea. I don't know what it is. PROPNAME is asking what it is and she was checking to see if it was the AC I hope that the crickets aren't in the room, it's like frogs croaking at nite before u go to sleep or the heater going on. but it's hard to concentrate with all that noise. but I think I can manage. anyways what was I talking about? oh yeah my cs homework, I came back from work and just asked PROPNAME for some help since he has a computer I went at around one thirty becuase I came back at around one from work grabbed my computer and talked to kevin and then went down to PROPNAME to see PROPNAME play the piano, I just asked him to come with me to Painter. good! finally the chirping has stopped some guy is banging on the AC poor crickets. but it's finally stopped cool!! anyways I went to the dorm room in jester which was a fifteen minute walk. fifteen minutes sometimes is a long way but not when ur determined. fifteen minutes is to gregory gym, which is good but sometimes when I'm walking to RLM it seems like it'll take forever and I'm just five minutes away, why does it seem to be so far?  I needed to take a break sometimes. which is totally weird. oh well. hmm. there's a coke can around me and it's been there for a couple of nites actually only around three days or around two. martin got it for me the day before and I just decided to leave it in the fridge. I should probably just recycle it. the recycling bin isn't that far away. only like a two second walk actually around one minute. more or less. give or take a few it's near the trashcan and stuff it's kept in the washing room. it has a washing machine and a dryer and also it has like a sign-up sheet so that people can get to it easier instead of waiting u just take a time period of around three hours u know? anyways it's an iron board in there and a broom and mop. which reminds me that the room is getting dirty. looking at the computer it looks really cool. it's miniature, I almost didn't want to get it because sony is discontinuing it and u know I thought there was something with it. I don't know. u know that most people don't want stuff that's going out. but this is  a silver and metallic purple color. I was at work for an hour just sorting out papers of different colors there was buff, metallic orange, canary yellow and all these various colors which is strange because there are the brites and the normal colors which are paler. but I'm already done. so guess this is the end. 
__label__label1 As I listen to this music I think about when I was younger, when I had a friend named Casey. But is she still my friend, or not?  What about PROPNAME, she thousands of miles away in LOCNAME. I really don't know what I feel for her. I want to be with her, but I don't think as much as she does with me. I feel guilty, but what have I done to her, I have been there for her, drove her around, let her cry in my arms. I must sound shallow, maybe not, I really don't know. Is she the one, I really don't know how to answer this question. What happens next, if she moves back, then she will probably live with me. I don't know if I can handle that. I have started talking to PROPNAME, she is very sweet, but is just someone to latch on to or is she really special. It started out harmless enough, but we have really started talking, and I really like her, as much as PROPNAME I really can't say, shouldn't I be worried more about school, I have astronomy homework due Friday. I feel like I can almost tell when PROPNAME is going to call or come in. right now she is one of my best friends, in a world that is new to me. in fact since I have been here, the best friend I have had. PROPNAME has a very sweet personality and a good understanding of people. much like many people I have met, good or bad I really can't say. sometimes I catch eyes with her and my heart takes a drop, a feeling that I haven't had in a long while. that really feels good, it opens you back up, makes you feel good, alive, a purpose. if I do break it off with joanna, what will happen, will that be a big mistake what if she is the one. how can break it off with someone who is in LOCNAME, that is cruel, she hasn't done anything to me, I haven't done anything to her though. you get to a point where living life in a certain way or doing something in a certain way is just not right anymore. or doesn't seem right, being or I am really not with her, just doesn't seem right. but if I am not with her anymore will it not seem right in that respect also. this subject is really what I hide from in life, am a an asshole, or I am just telling the truth to myself, I mean after all the school saying or whateveris YE SHALL TELL THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE is the truth making me free or tearing me apart, I think I do love joanna, that is the bummer part, but to go into it with the scales tipped is just wrong, maybe I am wrong, I really don't know  
__label__label0 I hate the miami dolphins and jimmy johnson, always smacking his lips. the broncos suck with out elway and not the dolphins will win. god I hate the dolphins. I miss erin so much, I hope I can stay faithful to her. everyone makes me feel stupid for staying with her when she is still in high school, but she is only 0 hours away. I can hardly wait till she comes down this weekend. I could not be more stressed, tests and other crap are bogging me down. it is so hard to make friends here that I feel comfortable around and that is only making me more nervous and stressed. I hate my rtf class, it is stupid and pointless. the reading is so painful I can barely stand to do it. dammit the dolphins scored again! I hate the dolphins! thank god almighty the cowboys won,I would have had a heart attack if they had lost, I miss my friends so much. I can hardly wait to see them in a month. there are so many damn hippies around here, sometimes they are entertaining but they are mostly just annoying. DAMN I HATE THE DOLPHINS. my phone bill is going to be huge from talking to erin, my parents are going to kill me. I feel pressured to entertain her friends this weekend and that I also stressing me out. my room needs to be cleanded badly, this place is disgusting. why can't erin just be here now, if she went here my life would be next to perfect. 
__label__label1 Ever since I can remember, I have always had my friends. There's my best friend, PROPNAME, and then my other best friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Ever since I was a baby, we have always been friends. We have all gone to school together and now we are all attending the same college. Before I found out I had gotten a scholarship to UT, I had been planning to go to ORGNAME ORGNAME. Me and PROPNAME would go to ORGNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME would go to UT. Just thinking about splitting up for the first time in our entire lives can still make tears come to my eyes. NOw I will never know how it would have been.   Sometimes I do wonder how it would have been and sometimes I don't care because I'm so happy to still be with them. I realize that they are such a great part of me and my life. We all know each other so well. There is hardly nothing about them that I don't know and there is nothing about me that they don't know. To even say that they are my best friends does not express how much they mean to me. They are more than just friends. I don't know why, but somtimes I can't help but think about how lucky I am to have them. And at the same time, I know I take them for granted. I know that if I ever need anything, anything at all, that I can go to them and they will help me in a way that no one else can. I once heard this poem that simply explains my relationship with my friends. The poem may not be word for word, but I hope it is can better describe just how much I love my friends. First there was one. Then there was two. You came along and then there was three. A circle of friends, no beginning, no end. 
__label__label0 Well all I can think about at the moment is how stressful college is and why we have so much work to do. I don't understand it at all and I am very stressed out at the moment. highschool seemed so much easier but I know that it is something that I need to get used to. on top of it all I have so much sorority things to do. we have so many meetings and assignments to do on top of all of our school work. I just want to sit in my room and sleep because I am not feeling well. also I miss my parents. eventhough they are fifteen minutes away I am missing them but when I get around them they annoy me so bad. I don't understand it. I am difinately looking forward to our weekend because I know that our pledge retreat will be so much fun. especially becauase I cannot wait to get to know my pledge sisters. it will be awesome. I feel disconnected from so many of the girls and I know that they are feeling the same way. we seem to go out with the same people every weekend when there are fifty other girls that we still haven't really gotten the chance to meet. I really miss my friends from home a lot. especially jenna. but I know that she is having a blast at tech with kristi. the dorm is awfully quiet tonight. more so than usual. it is very weird not to hear people running up and down the halls screaming at the top of their lungs. it's actually very nice. I probably won't be able to sleep because I am so used to the noise. sleep also sounds really nice. I feel like I haven't done it in a year. now that I am sick I know that sleep is very important but who has time for sleep when there is a million other things to do in life. I also need to do laundry sometime in the next century before I run out of socks to wear. I think my mom said she was going to buy me some new socks this weekend but I never saw those. I wish it would just rain so then I would have an excuse to just sleep all day long. sleeping during a storm is so awesome. it feels so comforting. this is really weird just writing about random things. I feel like I am talking into a recorder or something or just having a really weird dream. actually I feel delirious just looking at all of the random thoughts that go through my mind. I feel like it's deep thoughts by jack handy. if you ever evaluate what you think about it funny to think that "we always sweat the small stuff and it's all small stuff. "  my dad loves that quote and he also reminds me of it. when I went to the doctor today he was writing down random quotes on the hospital bed paper about college and lecturing me about school. it was really annoying. oh well he was a very old man anyways. he told me never to forget those quotes and of course I already did. what does he expect of a busy girl like me. crazy people. well my time is up. I wish I could type faster so I would have more to say but this is it. random thoughts by PROPNAME PROPNAME. 
__label__label1 okay, well to start off, I'm really not sure or confident of how my experience here at LOCNAME will effect me. "will I succeed, or fail, only time will tell", I really have a hard schedule for my first semester, a lot of memorizing, which I can do, but just don't want to put that much effort. Sound like I'm a no brainer, but if I have to do it "ill do it", that doesn't mean I want to. my goal is to have a midrange of a 0. 0 to 0. 0 avg. but right now I'm right this short writing assignment for Psy. and I reallly just can't seem to expand my thoughts on the consccious, I guess it's because the prompt says, think spontaneously, but how the hell do I do that if I'm under pressure. excuse my language. but just thinking spontaneously. well I really like this prompt, because there is no right or wrong answers and its just basically a written expression of how one's mind works. I'm not trying to kiss up or anythin, but really I do enjoy this. I would have hoped though, that the class would be a little smaller, so I could ask questions freely and not feel bothered, but that's no excuse I guess, what kind of reputation will I have amongst 00,000 people. Well my goal, is to continue doing well academically and also create a good social life. becoz I can't just study and have no fun, that's not in my domain. I've never had stress before, but I might break that barrier this semester. first day of class was pretty cool, because the professor , mr. peddebaker was pretty funny, and I hope I spelled his name right. anyway its a nice experience. I wonder how long it will take me to study for biology, thats probably my toughest class, coz I don't really enjoy it. I loved it at first, but then I took ORGNAME ORGNAME in high school, and my teacher made it so much work, and I didn't reallly get to enjoy it. it was not a fun learning experience. well it's been ten minutes, and ten more to go I'm really counting down dnow. I just say that click once to submit button ( click just onece on submit when you are done)  right now I'm watching this girl, while I type, write the longest email I've ever seen, and on lmy left that girl's writing one too,  god, don't they have somethin better to do? wrong statement, I was judging them, the truth is I probably write more emails then them. that 's because I lived in three different places less than thrree years. Los angeles for 00 and dallas for 0, and austin for one month. I'm movin like a train. but. well I forgot what I was going to write, ooopos oh well, I just got off my spanish class, and that profesor was pretty cool, although I understood his spanish better than his english. but it was still enjoyable. I want to join a fraternity, but I'm afraid I wont have time to do my schoolwork. but I still want to be social and everything like that, I guess is just another decision to think upon. oh my god, this girl stopped writing her email! the lab must be closing, nope, its not , just being sarcastic well I've got exactly five more minutes and I'm officially done with my first college assignment. I wonder how many words I've written,  babbling on and on is something I could do. well I just got a new neighbor in the lab, she's pretty cute, I wonder if I should talk to her,  naaaaa, seeems to involved with what shes about to do, oh well, maybe ill see her around, yeah right!, in this place no way. man I wish this one girl went here, PROPNAME, she was my high school crush, she was a good friend of mine but I never really asked her out or anythin, I thing she was dating someone at the time, oh wel, thats why I got to be aggressive over here, its a fresh new start. two more minutes left, well I just had to rub my nose it was itching, and fix my hair. well I got one minute maybe ill start on the other assignment, but I don't know how long that would. done 
__label__label1 I have a lot of stuff to do tonight. I'm glad I'm getting this done relatively early. I wont have to worry about it when it comes time to turn it in. I usually don't get assignments done thiis quick but I have a lot of stuff to talk about soi thought I'd go ahead and do it. I found out about bonnie having breast cancer today and that just adds to the fact that meme has cancer as well. that's two people in one week that I'm close to that have found out that they have cancer. I haven't known many people in my life wit hcancer and all of the sudden this happens. I really wish they didn't have to go through kemo therapy. it seems so primitive and I hope a more efficient and effective cure is found soon. I talked to rachel tonight. I know we will probably never have anything but the situation with her mom may bring us all very close. I love them like my own family and I know that me and mom are ready to fly out there anytime we're needed. five minutes have gone by and I'm already tired of typing. I'm excited about seeing ashley this weekend. I miss her. I'm really looking forward to meeting all of seth's friends. he says they're all hot so this ought  to be a good weekend. I'm glad everything has worked out with seth and my parents. I feel a lot more happy when I talk to rachel. she still has that effect on me even after the rough time we had this summer. I still think she is one of the finest girls I have ever met. I just got a new email but I can't check it for another ten minutes and that is going to drive me crazy. I have to clean my truck out tomorrow. after starr dumped that frapuccino all over the place, it has stunk in there. this is a really good song. I like listening to heartbeats on the beat. somethimes they depress me though. I wish I could send one out to someone special. I'm sure she's out there; I just have to be patient and not try to force anything to happen. I have a really good life. it would be much better with a girl but I can do without untill the right one comes along. I'm so excited about going to vail for new year's. we're going to have so much fun. I'm glad kim is going. she is so cool and my best friend in the world. kelly is such a good cook. so is mom. those were both very random. I'm not sure where I want move next year. I pretty much have any option open since brannon lives in some of the most expensive appartments in the city. I only have five minutes left. this is a cool assignment. I like to just sit down and write my feelings for a while sometimes. it helps t osoothe my nerves. I really wish I could check my mail. I have a lot of readiign to do. I love this stuff we're talking about in psycology. I'm not just trying to suck up or anything because I figure dr. penn wont even read this. it is all just really intriguing to me and I am haveing so much fun. I hope meme and bonnie are both alright. I want to see the ellenburgs again. I hope they come out and see us soon. I want to see rachel again, too. and reagan. 
__label__label0 This is a little confusing. I am not quite sure what I ahould be doing. Oh well I guess it really doesn't matter. I am glad I am going home this weekend. I really miss everyone. It will cool to just hang out at home and not have to worry about what I should be doing right now. College is a lot of reading. I am actually learning a lot more than I learned in a whole semester of high school. I enjoy that but it does get to be a bit tedious, expecially science. Well iguess it can only get better form here on. I was confused about a lot of stuff, like what to do with all of my spare time. I was going to have a job but then they took away my work study and now I have too much free time. That's okay because I didn't really want to work anyway. But I can't believe the lady never called be back. Tha t is just rude etiquette. Oh well. There's nothing I can do about it anyway. I wonder why we are shunned by our dorm mates. I guess we weren't social enough or something. We tried. But at least they aren't outright mean to us, they are just very cordial and you know what that means. Doh!  Oh well. It's fun rooming with PROPNAME, I just don't know why she chooses to bother me on purpose sometimes. I think she can be very immature at times. But I would rather put up with that than with someone who barely talks or just doesn't like me for whatever reason. I don't want to go to all those meetings tonight that sucks!  Maybe I just won't go. But I probably will. I can't shirk my responsibilites just because I don't want to. Maybe some people need to do that once in a while though. I wonder what PROPNAME would have to say about that. His books are cool. I like the idea of PROPNAME just sitting around waiting to confuse people. If you make people question their own values, then what do you consider as your values?  I don't know. LThat's just odd. 
__label__label1 hopefully I remember to stop in 00 minutes. my mind went blank for a sec. what should I write about, what am I thinking about. what is this group's name, the group who sings "what's my age again. " it's blink 000. just thinking about the song, singing it in my head. should I go ahead and write the lyrics down since it's in my head? keep on singing the song. now I'm pondering about what I should write and think. I hate this song, christina aguilera's "genie in a bottle. " my is thinking what to think so that I can type it down. my mind is completely blank, I have no thought or feeling whatsoever. now the room is getting cold. I can feel goosebumps forming. I'm singing the song I don't like. I was thinking that thank goodness I'm not working tomorrow morning. my eyes are beginning to hurt from staying glued onto the computer. I wonder is it time yet? another song is playing, and again I'm singing to it. singing the song. come on, think of something so that I can type it down. thinking of what I need to do tomorrow: go to co-op and return my books before it's too late to get a full refund on books. I have to meet with my sister so that I can get her some food. I also need to go this store so that I can buy a new pair of sandals since the ones I have right now are getting ready to tear on me. it's located behind einsten's bagel store. my mind is drifting back to the song. I think the music is distracting me from thinking. all I can think are the lyrics of the song and nothing else unless I make myself think of something. now another song is playing, but I forget who sang it. the name of the song is "how's it going to be. " trying to think of the artist who sings this song. I can't seem to think of the artist's name, but I know it, it's like it's on the tip of my tongue. I know it, but can't say it. I hate that feeling. my mind is once again blank. I'm thinking about the mall. because today we went to the mall. I'm now thinking about the topic of this writing assignment, am I doing it correctly? hopefully. how long do I have to go now? just thinking about the meeting that our dorm is to have concerning with sex since the radio had said something dealing with sex. I'm now making myself think of things. so I'm thinking of when I'm going to go back home. I'm thinking about wanting to go shopping. I'm thinking about the allegations I've read in the daily texan on gap. about how the were alleged to using sportshops. I'm thinking that if the allegations are true, will I continue to shop there. I'm thinking about the m&m commercial, the latest one, since I thought I heard something similiar to that on the radio. I was thinking of something, but was unable to type it down, wasn't fast enough. thinking of the song that is now pllaying, tlc's "unpretty. " is time yet? feels like 00 minutes is forever and endless. when is this over. found out that I have one minute leftover. feel like just stopping since it's only one minute. reminiscing about my chat with my friend through the aol instant messaging. I think it's time. time now. yes, I'm done. 
__label__label1 I am so glad to be home this weekend but at the same time I really feel like crying right now. I don't know what is wrong with me . I don't want to go back to school I really hate it there. I really just wish that I could make some friends it seems like everyone already has made new friends and they don't want any more. I just can't be the type of person to go uot and meet new people. but I may not even be here next semester so what is the point of making friends if I will be at a different school in a month. atleast I have PROPNAME there with me at school I am only happy when I am with him but I can't be with him all the time I have got to live my own life. he says that if I hate the dorm so much that I should move in with him but I am really scared to , I think because I am afraid he will get tired of me. iam also worried that if I change schools next semester that he will give upo on us and want to be with someone that he has there with him all the time. he says that he doesn't want me to leave and I believe him buthim saying that is really unfair to what I want. I am just not happy there at school and he shouldn't want me to stay there just because it makes him happy. atleast things are better now than they were when I first moved to austin . I know that I cried a lot and it was probably annoying but carrye didnt have to yell at me about it she is my friend and my roommate and she should understnad that the transistion to college is not that easy for everyone. I am scared to talk to her about anything because I am afraid she is going tro jump down my throat again. I wish I was good at talking back to people and that I wouldnt let everyone walk all over me . but I can't help it I don't know what to say to people when they trake advantage of me. I don't want to make them mad at me but what can I say . the few times that I did talk back they embarrass me by making it seem like my fault, and like I am freaking out. why are people so mean. I am so ready to just be married and have a job and live my life and not have to follow everyone's rules no one seems to understnd me but hey thats ok I don't even understand myself. I just want to be happy and I am not happy right now and now that I am home I want to go back to school because I feel to growm up and mature for my friends that are here. I will figure it all out one day  
__label__label0 I have decided to get a head start on my writing assignments so here I am writing about my thoughts. I am completely amazed that I can do this assignment on the internet. I mean five years ago who ever would have thought that you would be typing and submitting assignments off of the internet. Sometimes I wonder if the internet is just getting way to big. I hear people say that they think that it is going to get so big it will just collapse in on itself. Personally I do not completely understand what they mean by that. But it is kind of scary that any kid can go on the internet and get as much information about guns and hate groups as they want. I guess, like most things in life, the internet has its good points and its bad points. This writing assignment is my first writing assignment in college! It is so weird that I am now a college student. I still feel like I don't completely belong here. I have met a lot of cool people, but it definately does not feel like home. For some reason I have not come to realization yet that I am here for like seven more months. I still have no idea what I want to study. My major right now is microbiology. I was planning on becoming a doctor, but I'm not completely sure. I think that is what I want to be but I am interested in so many things. I'm taking an architecture class this semester just to see if I'll like that. I am good at math and science so I considered engineering. The only problem with engineering is that I really don't understand what an engineer does! I love science so I guess the medical field is good for me. Lately though I have been thinking of studying to become a veternarian. It involves science and animals and I absolutely love animals. The problem with deciding on a major is that I have no clue what each major entails. I guess I will have to go and research all the different majors I have been thinking of. This past june I went to this program called National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine in LOCNAME. I did not really want to go but I decided it would help me to make up my mind on becoming a doctor. It did not really do that, but it was an interesting experience. We went to ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and talked to med students there. That was interesting because I was expecting like a bunch of Einsteins sitting there just naming off different formulas and equations. Actually they were just normal people who did not seem any different from myself. Also at the Forum we went on hospital tours and some kids (I wasn't one of the lucky ones) got to shadow a doctor for a day. My friend PROPNAME was able to actually watch open heart surgery. She said she saw the doctors flatline the heart (I guess the do that in open heart surgery) and then revive it. I was angry about that because I really wanted to see something like that. Instead, the hospital I went to, we had an eighty year old man take us on a hospital tour. Like I've never seen a hospital before! All in all the trip was fun because I at least got to see LOCNAME. I had never been on the East coast before and it was really interesting. LOCNAME is an amazing city but it is way too chaotic. I had been accepted at ORGNAME ORGNAME and I did not go there because it was way too expensive, and after actually going to LOCNAME I was glad that I did not choose to go there. I mean, I love big cities and all, but LOCNAME is just way too big. I would lose myself there. So here I am at LOCNAME. I am from LOCNAME and my final decision in a school was between LOCNAME and UofM. The only reason I came to ORGNAME was because my parents moved to LOCNAME a few weeks ago for my dad's job so I figured I might as well come to school here too. Being up in LOCNAME with my parents down here just seemed like it was way too far. I am ready to get away but not that far away. LOCNAME is so different from LOCNAME. It is really hard to get used to. I have never seen a state show their state flag so much. It is cool, just different. I live in LOCNAME for 00 years and I don't even know what the state flag looks like. Everyone down here is really nice though. I like that a lot. I guess it is a southern thing, because people are really eager to talk to you. I can't believe how many people I have met and I have only been here for a week. I like UT a lot and I am glad that I chose this school. I am sure that after time I will feel like a true UT student. I guess that I just need to find my niche in the college scene. 
__label__label0 I think college is going to be the best part of my life. Coming from my high school, it seemed hopeless to find a place where I'd fit in. LOCNAME has such a wide diversity of people and so many ways to meet new people, that I think, I will have no problem finding someone like me. Of course, right now, I'm still a little shy about talking to people but hopefully that will change. I really want to join a soroity and become active in as many Hispanic and other multicultural events or projects as my schedule will allow. Maybe this will help me find the kind of people that can relate to me. Even though I only know a couple of people on campus, I feel more comfortable there than I ever did in high school.          Outside of school, things are good at home. I have all the love and support than I can ever ask for from my family. Without them I don't know where I'd be. I love them very much. I don't know why I can't tell them that. I guess I'm just too stubborn. I also get a lot of support from my boyfriend. Even though I didn't really want a boyfriend, I'm glad he's there. He brings a lot of fun to my life. I hope school doesn't take away my time for him. I know its going to though, ecspecially if I join all the organizations that I want.            Overall,I'm satisfied with everything. I know its going to be a long and hard four years, but I'm looking forward to walking the stage with an engineering major.           
__label__label0 Right now I am sitting at home checking my email and different things. A lot of things are running through my head. I need to read for my classes, I need to go to work, and I need to clean the house. I am interested in this psychology class and I like Dr. PROPNAME a lot. He is funny and keeps class interesting. I look forward to class and believe that I will learn a lot. My sensations at the moment include being extremely tired. I am worried about getting everything done and think that I have to much to do. I am very happy it is the weekend and am so glad I don't have class on Friday and this weekend on Monday. I am excited about this weekend because my small town is having a picnic and they are always a lot of fun. I am sorry that I will miss the ORGNAME football game against ORGNAME but the last one I went to was extremely hot and I was drenched with sweat. I had a lot of fun in spite of the heat though. I love the spirit of the fans and feel proud that I attend a university with so much pride and support. I love to be amidst the fans and hear the roar of the games in general. I saw so many burnt orange shirts in the stands that I couldn't believe it. It is almost solid burnt orange with an occassional white or some other color shirt. I don't need to buy any more UT clothing, etc. I have to much stuff already, but every time I go into the bookstore I buy something with UT on it. I feel sorry for whoever has to read this or check it over because it is boring and I don't even know if I am doing this right. I am just writing what I am thinking and it is turning out to be a cool assignment. I think it has been about twenty minutes so I am going to end the assignment. I enjoyed this and it helped me to write these things out. It felt like I was talking to someone who was a very good listener, even though it was a computer screen and  no one will probably read it anyway.   
__label__label1 I really enjoy college life, I love being away from my parents but my boyfriend is still in dallas and I miss him so much that it hurts. Sometimes I feel as though I am alone and that this college world is so enormous it feels intimidating. psychology has been an interest for me since I was in middle school because when I was younger there were six guys who came up to me and my brother and asked us for our money and then pproceeded to hit my brother. this experience was very traumatizing to me and after that I went to my school counselor to talk to her about it all she helped me so much that I really got interested in what all the mind does and what one mind can do to another through therapy I went to my medical terminology class today and I was so tired because I stayed up until like 000 last night and now I am very tired and would like to just go to sleep, but I have another class college is completely different from high school I never believed people that said that until I got here ever since I have been here all I think about is my boyfriend and how I wish he was here and my studies I am really getting serious about school and I am excited about my years to come because I love the environment of everyone caring about school and their studies which is completely different than what people thought of in high school I love this environment I am in the computer lab right now doing this assignment  I hope I am doing this right even though it says there are no right or wrong answers to this writing assignment  this weekend jovan, my boyfriend's uncle is having his wedding party and I am going home for it at 000 I have to meet my brother at his fraternity house to get the car so I can get on the road to dallas I am excited about seeing everyone and everyhting but the drive by myself kinda makes me nervous just as long as I don't have to drive in the dark for a long time I will be okay cause it just kinda scares me when I am driving a long way in the dark by myself I did that survey thing for this class the pretesting last night on my friensd natalies computer and I thought it was pretty funny some of it the spider part actually made me scared even though I have never really had a fear of spiders before not like I was extremely scared of it but itr made me start thingking about spiders for a moment this day has been so busy it feels like anyway but then again I have had worse  I wonder if I will really fulfill my dreams of becoming a psychiatrist or what will happen in my future I know that me and jovan are going to get married in probably about 0 or 0 years - I hope anyway he is moving down here next year so we can be together I love him more than anything - everything about him my best friend is in utah right now at byu and I miss her so much I just read her email a few minuites ago and she is having a blast I wont get tosee her until christmas and it will only be for like 0 days because she has to go to LOCNAME and then she has a football game to go to she is in band there with my friend john I was in band in high school but there was no way I was going to be in band in college because I really didnt like it that much in high school my parents wanted me to stay in it me and my mom have been arguing a lot lately and it has really bothered me but I think and hope things are getting better since italked to her last night this weekend is going to be so busy tomorrow I am going to take jovans car tot he shop to get something done to it while he is at work and then I am going to go help his family get ready for the big day on saturday then saturday we are going to party all day and sunday I need to study all day I have studied all week but I need to review for monday cause I have a quiz in medical terminology over suffixes prefixes and roots my first college quiz!!  I'm not really that exciterd but I thought I made add some sort of sarchasm into this little essay that I am writting this is actually really interesting because I have never had an assignment like this and it has almost been twenty mionutes I wish I could type faster I get to see jovan in like 00 hours or somethign he gets off work late he works at a print shop where he does press stuff and he really likes it but is going to go to college soon I think I am done now thanks for listening 
__label__label1 what am I thinking about don't got the foggest clue. looking to see how long I have to write for and what I am going to write about. thinking about a wonderful girl that I wish to be close to just wondering if she wants the smae or if I want to see other people.

__label__label0 right now it is 0:00 and I am suppose to write for twenty minutes. this shouldn't be hard, so ill just write exactly what comes to my mind. I'm sitting in one of the guys on my halls room. so I may make some references to what he is saying. Today was a very tiring day. i went to bed at nine last night and couldnt get up. i think I just over slept. I was excited to see my best friend for dinner tonight. he can always make me laugh and put a smile on my face. i need to get my hair cut when I go home this weekend. and I need to go shopping for my brother before I get home. its his birthday on sat. i am not sure what I need to get him. hes so easy to shop for but I want to get him something he will really like. My dad and my brother came in this weekend and I was so happy to see them. i only wish I knew if he were saved. i gave him a card last week in the mail asking him if he was because I wanted to know if he would be with me in heaven when all is said and done. and he still hasn't responded to the card. i hope I didnt scare him or make him feel uncomfortable. i just wish he would understand how awesome God is. he has done so much for me. and I just wish my dad would let God bless him as well. all I know is that without God. i would not make it through every day. I'm really blessed that the people I hang out with are strong Christians. i just hope that I am a strong influence on those who don't know Christ. I'm really glad I get to see my mom and sister this weekend . i miss them so much. I need to start managing my time better soon. or I am going to be far behind in my classes. i also need to start running again. its been about four days since I last ran. not good. I have no idea what to write next. but give me a minute and something will come to mind. i hope I'm thinking but what I'm writing is all I am thinking about. ok this past weekend some of my friends came up and it was good to see them. except one girl used two towels while she was here. i could of shot her. she doesn't understand that I am in college and as stupid as it sounds I don't have towels coming out my ears. and I have to wash them. and it cost money to wash living in the dorm. which I love there is always something to do here. its so much fun. there is never a dull moment. i only get annoyed when some girls down the hall yell and scream like they are haveing the time of their life all the time. it really starts to bug. i don't know I'm listing to this guy whose room I'm in talk on the phone so that is what is in my mind now. i can't wait tomorrow I start impulse. a freshman bible study on campus. i hope to meet some more life long friends there. iv really enjoyed this class so far. its fun and interesting. i have two minutes left to write. this really wasnt a hard assignment. it was easier than I thought. and kind of neat. i guess its almost time for me to start the next one. just a few more seconds and I'm done. ok anytime now. a minute seems a lot longer when you think it should be over. ok its over. 
__label__label1 I am really tired and bored right now. I am a really bad typist. I am so unhappy with myself, the way I look sometimes. I hate my body. I am in love with this guy and he says that I am beautiful, and goodlooking, but I don't believe him. I need to hear compliments though. Sometimes I wake up and I look at myself, and I like what I see, then I go outside, and I see all the other girls, how thin and tan they are, and I suddenly hate my body again. This boy doesn't even know that I am in love with him, and I haven't seen him in a few months, because he went to summer school here while I stayed at home and worked. every time I see him I fall for him all over again. But with distance, I slowly get over him, and think about him less. But he is always in the back of my mind. I feel so comfortable with him, like I can say or do anything and it doesn't matter. I think that he is perfect in that I recognize and accept his faults, and only want him to become more secure with himself. I think that he is a beautiful person. There are things I don't like, but I love him as a whole person, for who he is. And I hope I will see him again soon. I have thought about him since we said goodbye last May. I tried to get in touch, but it didn't work. And now he has a girlfriend and I think it is too late for us. It will always be the wrong time. But I can't stop loving him. Has it been twenty minutes yet, I don't think so. Oh well. I want to find someone that I can feel a friendship for that I could learn to love that would love me in return for who I am. That is why I love this Boy so much. We are such good friends, and he knows so much about me. He is a liar. I'm a liar. we are perfect for each other. Except that know he is in love with someone else, and has been with her. I want to be friends with her, but looking at her, I just don't like her, there is just something wrong with her. hopefully they will break up and he will realize he has no future with her. she is still in high school! wont graduate for two more years! she is a little girl. I think that time must be almost up now. Goodbye. 
__label__label1 MMMMM I wonder what's for dinner tonight??? I have so much crap to do before I leave to go home. Why is this print so small? Oh well, I have no idea what to get PROPNAME for her birthday. Man I'm really having a hard time typing today. I wonder who's on im. I hope PROPNAME is I can't wait to see him on Saturday, and I really can't wait for the Mexican food. I need to spend time with my mom and dad and go shopping so I have clothes to wear down here. I don't want to go on that retreat. This sucks. Okay well I have another 00 minutes and my head is so jumbled up. I bet they think I'm a moron. My back hurts and I really need a nap. I don't want to write my English paper! I need to find a job here so I can have some spending money. I can't believe my math book cast me $00 that really put a damper on the day. I can't type for the life of me today. I wonder why they put a sticker of a bee on this computer. That's so random. I want to check my hotmail I wonder if anyone exciting wrote me. I haven't heard from my mom I wonder if everything's okay. I really need a nap. This whole go out every night and wake up at 0 thing is killing me. Oh crap I have to do my math homework. I wonder if it will matter if I go tomorrow. I'm going to be so exhausted. I should go grocery shopping so I can have some snack to munch on. The food here really isn't that bad. I should work out again today because I only worked out for 00 minutes and ate a huge lunch, I can't gain that freshman 00. I hope someone calls me I'm bored. That's neat that this computer capitalizes your Is for you. Only 00 more minutes. I hope Cat can get her cd burner working I really want that song it was so sweet. Man am I glad we don't have mandatory study hours, talk about adding to my stress. My eyes keep closing. I wonder if I'll see PROPNAME tonight. I'm stressing out about TX OU weekend. I want to be able to see my family and PROPNAME. I can't believe its $000 to make a cooler what do they think this is homecoming? I'm glad my face cleared up last time I go get my eyebrows waxed. I wish I were going home tomorrow. I don't want to go on this retreat. I wonder when we're getting our tshirts in, hopefully soon. Man my wrists hurt. I really need to get one of those pad things. I wonder how I'm supposed to paste this into that other site??? Yes, only two more minutes left. Wow that went by pretty fast. I can't believe how bad I'm typing today. I wonder when I can get my student ID back. I hope we actually get tickets. TIMES UP! 
__label__label1 so many things to do. must read in rhetoric today. two whole chapters. I wonder if I should drop that class. she seems nice but only gives 0 or 0 A's. I could be one of those A's. but what if I'm one of those C's that she says are "solid writers"?? wish I was a good writer. after I read must read chemistry and psychology if I don't start soon I'll never start. and lord knows if I get behind in any of my classes, I'll never catch up again. I'm glad that I bought the notes today for chemistry. now I know what to study. but it was expensive our professor must be making a fortune! can't wait until 0:00pm I can take a break from life and focus on me! me me me me. I'll finally be able to go to the gym and work out. I've gained so much weight already. I wonder if my boyfriend notices and just doesn't say anything. I bet he notices. he never complements me anymore. I'm a little disappointed in myself for letting my self go. I should've been more cautious about my eating habits. sometimes I just eat because there's nothing to do not because I'm hungry. I know that's wrong. to make matters worse my boyfriend is such a hard core work out freak. although I'm skinny, I'm slowly losing my girlish figure that attracted him to me. I know for a fact he can do better than me, but why is he with me? he says I'm everything anyone could ever want but I have so many flaws. for instance, I have the quickest temper and stubbornness in the whole wide world. my hair is still damp from taking a shower. that shower was good. it washed away the whole afternoon. all the stress. I hate being late. that's probably why I'm always half an hour early for all my classes. everyone thinks I'm a nerd but I just consider myself punctual. quite an overachiever. I like being an overachiever. it's the most commonly used word to describe me with. I always try to get ahead. that's why I'm always so stressed out. sometimes I wish I was not such a worry wart. I want to be laid back, really I do, but my happiness comes with having everything done and done on time and done well. the feeling of finishing and completing everything thoroughly and fully is the best feeling in the whole world. and that's what makes me an overachiever. this project isn't even done now. it's supposed to be done in a couple of weeks. I tried to do this project the day after proof. pennebaker assigned it but for some odd reason the site was down. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. hmmm. what should I eat for dinner. it's $0. 00 chicken wing night at pluckers. I live right above pluckers so it'd be easy to get to but I still have left overs in the fridge so I'll save myself the 0 or 0 dollars and eat in AGAIN. I wish I was rich. I wouldn't have to worry about how much dinner cost. I remember the day when it used to be like that. but I'm glad I ran away. I'm with PROPNAME now and he's better than having all the money in the world. I kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 00 years of overachieving. UT isn't bad. it's not great either. some people say it's like an Ivy League school but I highly doubt that. I would pick an east coast school over hicktown UT anytime. but since I'm here I have to make the best of this situation and endure the poor weather and large campus. six more minutes of writing. that means I can start thinking about what to do next. I think I'll read psychology since that's what I'm doing now. just the first chapter tonight then the first chapter in chemistry. that should do me for now then rhetoric I have to read chapters two through three. I think I've got it together now. 0 more minutes. wow, it's already been twenty minutes! this assignment relieved me of a lot of stress already! now I just have to read and take really good notes. no more online junk to take care of anymore. I have using the computer. don't people know that handwriting things is the best way to learn and memorize? well, I guess for me others love it. yes one more minute. I think I'll snack and study. it keeps me motivated. I guess that's it. I enjoyed this project! 
__label__label0 I don't ever know what to talk about in these damned things, although I know that the point is just to write whatever comes to mind. Nothing ever seems worth committing to anything besides a fleeting second of short term memory. My eye itches. I wish PROPNAME would stop singing that opera crap so I could concentrate on what I am doing. Oh, wait, this is what I am supposed to be doing. My head itches. What am I going to do about PROPNAME? On one hand, I want to be free to enjoy college life, having my own apartment, and the like, but at the same time, I wonder if pushing her away will be the biggest mistake I ever make in my life. Sometimes I kind of wish that someone else were making decisions for me, or at least the tough ones. My stomach hurts a lot, thinking about this all the time. I hope I don't get a ulcer. That really would suck. My head itches again. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing tonight; I should call him and see if he knows of any parties going on. I should probably take this keg shell back and get my deposit. Is PROPNAME here? He needs to call his mom. Oh crap, I was supposed to call my mom back. It will have to wait though. Damn homework. I wonder if I have anything else to do tonight besides this. Economics. no, Chemistry. no, Philosophy. no, cool no other homework. I wish I could type as fast as I think, that would be nice. I hope my mom isn't too mad that I'm not coming home this weekend. she'll get over it. I hope she understands though; I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings. She really is good to me; so is PROPNAME though. I wonder if Dad is back from his trip yet; he sure is out of town a lot. Maybe he will retire soon, and live off mutual funds. He'll probably wait for Katie to move out though. I wonder if PROPNAME will ever move out; maybe he's finally got his act together  I hope he does, anyway. I wish I could do something to help him out  if nothing else but to see where he could be, where his potential lies. I think even if I could find the words, he would not take the time to listen, or be willing to listen, one or the other. Is time up yet? No. Hmmm. what am I thinking now? All these question marks. makes me feel like the Riddler or something. I wonder if that means anything, that my "stream of consciousness assignment is flooded with question marks. Apparently, there are still many questions in my life. Will they ever be answered? More question marks  great. So many questions, and not enough resources to answer them by. Not to mention the fact that no one can help because no one else is in the situation. I wish there were some way to link with someone  make them feel what you feel and know what you know  maybe get some reliable advice for a change. 
__label__label0 Right now I'm thinking about the situation I am going through with my two roommates. School has just started and it looks like we will soon be at each others' throats. I really hope we can find a way to not get on each others' nerves because we are such good friends. I'm also thinking about my life and the new frontiers I am beginning to encounter. I can't stop thinking about how the next four years of my life are going to turn out. I hope everything is as great as everyone says it is and has been. I also miss my mom very much. Even though I don't talk to her everyday on the phone, I can hear speaking to me with her heart. The same thing goes for me too. My classes and keeping a responsible daily routine are at the top of my priority list right now. I don't want anything to interfere with me doing an exceptional job in all of my courses. It really is a big change for me being here at a university. Back home school was a breeze. Now I can actually feel that I'm going to have to study, which will be a first for me. The good side to that is that I like challenges. One of my friends from back home, who is really close to me, is planning to move to LOCNAME. There isn't anything wrong with that because heORGNAME "in love". I hope that he's making the right decision with the move and with her. I really care about him and I wouldn't want him to get hurt in any way. Although, I have a strange feeling that she might be the one for him. Either way he always has a lucky star just waiting to fall on him so that somewhat takes away a bit of my worriness. My other friends who are very close to me are still in my hometown going to school over there. I miss them all the time but I know that me being here is the best thing for me. For some reason I can't stop thinking about a girlfriend of mine who lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME because she is attending ORGNAME ORGNAME's ORGNAME. There has always been an unspoken romance between us but we have never actually been together because we have never brought it up, but we know that something is there. 
__label__label1 Well today I feel really stressed since there are so many things to be done for my classes. Like today I had to do this writing assignment to get it out ORGNAME the way and do my math homework. By the way, I have no idea how to do my math homework which adds on more stress to my life. Anyways this weekend was pretty fun since I went to a retreat for freshman and transfer students. I am a transfer student and I really miss ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME (the college I went to last year). At ORGNAME you get more individual attention and school work is a lot easier than here at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Today I have a class that is three hours long, and since this is the first Monday out of the semester it will be first time going to this class since it only meets on Mondays. Next week will be my first week to start work so I am really looking forward to it but also worried about how much rest I am going to get with school and work. It is my first job so I don't know how I am going to deal with it. Well this psychology class seems kind of scary because half of the time I don't know what the professor means by what he says and personally I am not a real psychology fan. I mean it isn't my favorite subject in the world and it is my first time taking a course dealing with how the mind works and why things are the way they are. I believe that God does everything for a reason so why question what God has done he knows everything. Don't get me wrong it is good to question things, but one is not going to understand everything in this world anyways. For example, if someone is brought up raising chickens in a farm and then goes to a city, that person is going to feel uncomfortable or out of place since he or she has been brought up in a farm. Well they are going to look at everything in a different point of view as if someone who has been living in a city all of their life. Also, people who lived in different countries with different customs and traditions, everyone is different in their own way so what good will it do to question everything since there are different answers for all of us. Another example is that I still don't know what correlation is we talked about it in the Discussion session and think it is some kind of relationship between two things and that is all I know. There are other terms that I am not to familiar with also and I hope I understand them better soon before the test. I really want to get good grades this semester so I don't have to be catching up in future semesters at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I really don't know that many people here, but I have met a lot of new friends at my church and that has helped me to get used to University life and the moral aspect of what not to do and what is good for me. Well I think that is about all I have to say today, hopefully I will understand the psychology class better as the semester progresses. 
__label__label1 Today was very interesting. So much to do, though, with so little time. Study, work, and just living has become harder than expected. I miss the comfort zone I enjoyed while living at home. Oh, home, what a distant thought that now seems to be. I miss my parents, but I don't really miss my sisters. Yes, I miss my Mom's cooking. More importantly, however, I miss her reassurance and soothing smile every day. The daily smile is a luxury I no longer enjoy. My roommate hardly every smiles and when he does it's far from comforting. I guess a big part of me is homesick. This is such a large school with so many people, I feel overwhelmed. It is especially hard living off campus and not having the ability to be in an environment where you meet new people on a daily basis. Here at the apartment, everyone keeps to themselves. They've already made friends with people during the freshman year or live with their best friends. I, however, am not that lucky. I don't really know too many people and I didn't even know my roommate before I moved here. But, I have this thought that some beautiful, charming young lady will soon save me from this pit of despair. I think I'm at a point in my life where love needs to prosper. I've never been one for steady, or healthy, relationships but the loneliness I'm currently enduring makes a girlfriend seem very tempting. Love is, after all, what makes the world go around or is it? I've been so independent and so bottled up for so long, I don't know whether this cold heart can be warmed up for love and I surely don't want to break anyone's heart. I've done enough of that and learned my lesson a long time ago. There's just so much beauty in this world. I find myself drifting off almost hourly with the vision of some really hot girl. I lived in a town that might have had ten goodlooking girls, so you can imagine how surprised I've been walking the LOCNAME campus. Nothing could have possibly prepared me for the beauty littered around the campus and PROPNAME as well. There are so many girls and so few guys; it hardly seems fair. But I'm in no way complaining. It's like I'm the guy in American Beauty whose heart aches because it sees so much beauty around it. That's me in a nutshell. I see all these gorgeous girls walking around and I freeze. I don't know what to do because I've never been in a situation quite like this. Tomorrow is a new day and the future is bright. I find myself waiting for some girl to fall helplessly into my lap, but I need to wake up and face reality. If I want to find a great girl I need to initiate conversation and go from there. Wish me luck! 
__label__label0 This is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever had to do. Usually we are always told almost exactly what to write, but I like the idea of doing this a lot more. I'm not too sure what you guys actually do with this things, but that's fine with me, because I'd much rather me doing this than writing some boring long paper. Today is a Friday, the second best day of the week. Thursday is the best, because my classes end at 00:00 and I only have one class on Fridays, so my weekend pretty much starts on Thursdays. College life is so much better than high school life. I love having all the freedom. The only part I would change is having someone making sure I get up in the morning for all my classes, I seem to be having problems with that, but I don't think it will happen anymore. I joined a fraternity, so I think that is helping making college more fun. Usually when most people think fraternity, they imagine the typical fraternity and everything that goes along with it, mainly the hazing. I joined PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, and it is a national policy of theirs not to haze, so I have nothing to worry about. I've heard stories about other fraternities hazing already, and I don't understand what the point of it is. Completely stupid! Why would you want to put people through the different kinds of suffering if you're going to live with them for the next 0 years? Yes, I understand that it can build strong bonds between each pledge class, but it just means you are always going to hate the class above you that hazed you. Being in PROPNAME PROPNAME is incredibly awesome, I can't imagine me ever having any regrets. By joining my freshman year, it makes me feel more comfortable at LOCNAME than I think I would have been if I had not joined. I no longer think of myself as just another random person, or number, at UT, because I know belong to something. I'm just kind of rambling on here, not really being able to think of much to say. I'm wondering if these are going to be used as examples of things in class, or if they have some other purpose we are unaware of. I think I'll talk more about me, because I'm such a great topic(hint of sarcasm there). I feel incredibly comfortable with my life. I think I am extremely at ease in most situations, and I think I have a good grip on life. I've moved around a lot, so I think that has helped me. I was born in LOCNAME and lived there for two years, then I lived in LOCNAME for seven years, then LOCNAME for three years, then LOCNAME LOCNAME for a year, then I moved back to the same city in LOCNAME and lived there for almost five years, then three days before the start of my junior year in high school I moved to LOCNAME, where I graduated, but my family now lives in LOCNAME again. Being moved around a lot and thrown into new situations has probably made the transition from living at home to being at college a lot easier for me than for other people. When I moved before the start of my junior year, I absolutely hated my parents for taking me away from my friends, and my life, but now I think it has made me a better person because I seem to just go with the flow now and except everything as it happens. Alright, well time is up, so I'm going to go. 
__label__label0 It's been almost a week since I have moved to LOCNAME to study. There have been times when I miss home, as well as times when I call my dorm room home. I don't understand why exactly I am here. None of this makes any sense. I've grown up, studying at a small school, small church, small community type settings, and I've thrown myself into the largest university in the nation, surrounded by many diverse students of all kinds. My friends have made the transition easier, as well as comforting. However, there's still a little void inside of me. Where did it come from though? I see that naturally, God has some sort of plan for me here. But as of now, I have not a clue. No reason, no rhyme. And here I am writing my psychology assignment on the day it was assigned. This never happens. I am the one who's lazy and always procrastinates to the last possible second before even lifting a finger towards any assignment handed my way. Yet, I feel like a change is about to occur. A transformation possibly, from a cocoon to a butterfly so to say. Leaving behind the old, and embracing the new as it comes my way. I look around my desk, seeing my personal belongs as it reflects my own personality, my soul, my spirit. And I realize, that I'm lacking. I have my mere clothing, and books for my classes, my computer. The only thing that resembles anything about myself is my Jars of Clay poster, given to me by a friend. This poster is the only tangible object, image to represent myself. Do I lack a soul, or have I yet to express it in a more productive manner? Why am I even writing about this anyway? Why did I begin writing this so early? Regardless of it all, I know that He has a plan for my life. Everything I do has a purpose for the sake of His glory. Whether people acknowledge His existence or not, He is still there and is all powerful. Two plus two is four, never five. God is here, and always will. People can choose to ignore Him, but His existence still remains. I miss my Youth Pastor, PROPNAME, who taught me to seek God with everything I have. He was the kind of man who'd parents would approve of as a personal mentor. His wisdom and knowledge of every concept in the world baffles me, and kept me curios. But it's his compassion that I miss the most. The tears he shed, when he heard of a young boy committing suicide because his peers perpetual teasing. The affectionate, unconditional love he expresses towards his wife and children. These things, I miss the most. But the one true divine aspect about PROPNAME, is that he's a man of God. A man who sought after God without ever holding back. He dove in. Not caring where or how, when or why, he dove in. Will mankind ever see a man like him again? I look at the clock, and my twenty minutes is almost over, only a minute left for my required writing time. Did I do the correct assignment? Did I do this the way my professor wanted me to? Oh well. Blah. 
__label__label1 Entering college is a whole new experience that is new to me. One that is unique in its own right. An experience that begins a new transition from the home to a life ORGNAME individuality and freedom. Being only three hours away from home, it didn't seem like I was breaking away on my own, but in actuality this is only the start of creating a new life for myself. After high school, everyone left there own way in seeking out a future for themselves. One friend would move to LOCNAME LOCNAME and another would move to LOCNAME. The once click of friends that you grew up is now a long distance relationship creating friends coast to coast. Although ORGNAME is a new change for me, it is one that is welcoming because it begins a new chapter in your life and basically gives you a clean slate to work on. From this day forward, I am able to become whatever my heart desires and whatever happened in the past I can put behind as memories. The challenge is a great one however with its competitive nature. Back in high school, I would hear stories of friends failing out of LOCNAME due to its luring temptation of the atmosphere of clubs and alcohol. Everyone seemed to be lured into the trap and go deranged when they got on their own. I would hear stories of friends messing up in school and having to return home. These stories although depressing helped me however in establishing the goal that I would not be like the rest, but an individual. That's what ORGNAME is basically is, just a group of individuals all with the same goal, a goal of succeeding which is sad that some take it lightly and begin to ruin their lives. Its like its own community at LOCNAME. All students relatively the same age trying to create a future for themselves. I sometimes wonder if I have what it takes to succeed at ORGNAME. My mind is still in doubt seeing the enormous campus each day as I walk to class. But all I can ask for is for my best and that is good enough for me. Even though ORGNAME is a different city than my home town LOCNAME, I still feel like I haven't left LOCNAME in a way. With all my friends attending this ORGNAME it just seems like LOCNAME all over again which is one of the reasons I was considering going out of State. It seems great to have a large number of your friends close to you, but in a way I have a desire to start totally fresh. Throughout campus, I would see students from my school walking up and down the street and sometimes wish that a whole new atmosphere was around me so that I can begin a life that is not attached to my old one. The University of ORGNAME does however let you become any kind of person you desire with a new start even though it is kind of mixed in with the old. As for home, I sometimes wonder if my parents are doing well without me. With their constant calls and visits, it seems like they lost a part of themselves when they had to let go of me. So along with the stress that comes along with being a student at a ORGNAME, my stress also comes with the worry of how things are back home. Seeing my mom cry, tore my heart apart with the goodbye that completed my transition to ORGNAME. I notice how people don't show how lucky they are that they have an opportunity like going to ORGNAME but instead take it lightly as if its nothing when in fact thousands of dollars are being invested in you in hopes that you create a successful future for yourself. College is a whole new experience that allows you tremendous independence. It is my job that I spend my time wisely and take advantage of the situation in creating something out of myself. I see some of my friends just wasting their lives away on drugs and partying. I would like to do something for them, but their destiny is their own fate of what they and make out of it. All I can offer them is my support. Although fear did strike me before I entered UT, it now has turned into an excitement of a whole new world. 
__label__label1 Right at this very moment I am feeling very anxious and very stirred up. I am thinking about everything that is due this week and I am very nervous. Not the good kind ORGNAME nervous that keeps you on your toes, but the kind that makes you want to vomit. I am sitting here typing this paper and not really knowing what I am going to write next. I am kind of stuck right now on what to type, but the assignment calls for us to write exactly what pops into my head while typing, and I guess this is it. I am thinking that I should be someplace right now I think that I may have missed something important all of a sudden. That is really scary. I hate that feeling. I am really tired right now and could really use a nap. I tossed and turned all last night and couldn't fall asleep. I woke up about every hour wondering where I was and if I had overslept and missed my class. Man I need some sleep. I really want to go home now, I am tired of this school already and I haven't even been here a week. I keep telling myself it will get better, it just has to, but I am really not sure of anything at this time. My life has been turned upside down, I have left the comforts of my house to come down here, and apparently I am supposed to be educated. I really don't think that I am going to be too much more educated than I already am. I think that college is just more of a matter of survival than skill. And I am paying plenty of my hard earned money to go here and be tortured like this. Man I wish my parents had enormous amounts of money so I could just come down here like some people and just play and have a good old time, but no I am here and I can't flunk out, because I am not able to drop any courses, or else I will not be considered a full time student. If that isn't stress I don't know what is. Anyways that seems to be my thoughts about the grand ORGNAME of ORGNAME right now. I have a feeling it might change within the next couple of weeks. It had better, or else I may not make it here. I considered just up and walking out and never coming back. It kind of seems like a bad idea. I am thinking also that I should not be having to write this paper if nobody is going to be grading it. I think it is a waste of my time. But apparently it isn't if it will help my grade. It seems really pointless to me that I have to write this paper for nobody. These walls are really green and who puts green and white carpet to cover walls. Walls are not supposed to be carpeted. I am the only person that is writing a paper right now and I think that I am being really loud. Nobody is saying anything but I know that they are looking over here watching and looking to see what I am doing making all that click click of the keys on the keyboard. Spanish is really going to kick my butt! I do not really comprehend anything and how I don't want to go to that class after I write this paper. I have about four minutes of writing left. What joy it brings me knowing that I am almost done with this assignment. What if I have done the assignment wrong? What if this is one of the papers the graders actually read and they think that it is bad and they give me a big fat F for my grade. ARGGGG! I think I am going to give myself an ulcer by the end of this semester! It seem like all I have on the brain is School school, school. I get to go to the Football game this weekend. Matt is going to come home and I get to see him. I guess that will be some fun. I am glad that I don't live in LOCNAME. I need to call him either tonight or tomorrow and see where I am supposed to pick him up at on Friday. There is a picture of a paper clip with a light bulb over its head and it is winking at me. That is really irritating. They really need to take that off of the computer program. Who ever comes up with some of this stuff? I wish I could just sit in an office all day and come up with ideas about different things. I think that would be fun. I really need to spell check this document now. The weekend is almost here. What fun. The paper clip is asking me what I want to do now. A talking paperclip, who would have ever thought. 
__label__label1 why am I being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department? the entire situation is abhorrent. it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not part of the grade, it is only taken away from the grade if one does not do it. the current state of the field called psychology frightens and disgusts me of course, if my writing assignment is one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening, then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing. insulting one's life work is no good, but this is how I feel and know it to be. because I have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that I am mistaken, but I do not doubt myself. the problem with natural selection is that has been warped, mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough. we have tinkered with natural selection, tried to control it, and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak. this I know. what to do about it? I don't. these negative things come to mind whenever I am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness. it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college, do not want to be in college for the sake of learning  having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp, willing brains. I have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference. maybe it's not even a timerelation thing. again, it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new, malignant form of "natural" selection. if this sounds disturbing, well it is. I don't appreciated being forced to submit and I emphasize that word, my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department. this has nothing to do with my benefit. I could and do this often on my own time. but I am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment, and for what? I don't exactly know, and that makes it worse. I have few things of value in this world, but I do have my mind and my intellectual property. I do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a PhD. but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works. does this sound radical? very well, it sounds radical. it is radical. just as a "serious" presidential candidate playing with subliminal messages in advertising is radical and frightening, so is this. and the ridiculous thing about all that is bush jr or the experts he has hired to think for him are trying to subliminally affect a group of people that don't even have the power to elect him. a more productive way to sleaze into the white house would be to simply bribe the electoral college. how did we come to this state of affairs? by people refusing to think, I suppose. not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved. these are the people who should be selected out, yet are not. how did this come to be? I don't know. maybe television is performing some sort of mind control we don't even know about, as conspiracy theorist as that sounds. track my thoughts and feelings as they occur. what if I don't think in language? what if I think in images, sounds, smells, etc? how are you to know how I think? stream of consciousness is not writing. it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do. if animals could talk or write, stream of consciousness is what they would do. thank god, my time is almost up. I suppose I should say that I've never met a psych major that I liked or respected, since that is what just popped into my head. in submitting this, I suppose I am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please, plagiarize, or otherwise. it is no longer my property, I have been forced to give up a part of my mind. so it can be categorized and used as someone's research and study. I will fit into the category of bitter, paranoid lesbian female from small town outside of texas, nonfreshman, English major. I have seen my life summed up by such words before, also by such people as yourselves. I suppose I should save this as the computer and website seems to be messing up right now. no way in hell I want to do this all over again. oh look  time is up. I guess you won't be privy to my thoughts any longer. 
__label__label0 Yesterday in class we talked about what different parts of the brain are in control with. One interesting part to me is the Occipital Lobe. Three years ago I was in a car accident, which I have fully recovered from, expect I have blurred vision in my right eye. Within a few months after the accident I went to many doctors to see what the problem was. One doctor concluded that my optic nerve had been jarred which can cause loss of eyesight. He said that after a year if my nerve turned white then that meant that this is what happened. He also said that I would never regain my eyesight in that eye. Now that it's three years later, there is still no sign that my optic nerve was injured and my eyesight has gradually come back but it is a very slow process. Another doctor could not reach a conclusion but he figured that it might have something to do with my brain. He told me that you could never tell if the brain can overcome such a catastrophe but the brain can do miraculous things. Sometimes during the semester I may come in a see what you think it could be because no one else seems to come to a conclusion matching another professional's opinion. I do not know if such a thing could happen to the occipital lobe so I would like to come in and see if just part of your eyesight can be affected if this lobe has damage done to it. 
__label__label0 I have never considered myself a good student. I never studied in high school, and did not expect anything to change once I got to college. Now I find myself in my dorm doing my homework in advance. I wonder to myself, why? I am not the type of person to do things in advance, but now I am. I think the overwhelming challenge of college has presented itself to me. I used to be the person that would drop anything to go party, but now I'm in LOCNAME, were there are many parties, but I am in my room typing a paper that isn't due until Friday, and it's only Sunday. I think that college has changed my way of thinking and acting, and I want to know why? I find myself wanting to learn, instead of having to learn. The thought that all of this studying will make me a smarter person, instead of just help me pass the test is actually a refreshing one. I still wonder to myself, why is this change happening now? Is it the transition from high school to college what is driving me to be a smarter person? I think that the challenge of studying and making good grades is actually helping me to become a better person. Or am I becoming a better person? Because of so much studying, and the quest for knowledge, I have less time for the people that I love. So is this good for me, or bad for me? Why do I study better when I am back home in Temple, LOCNAME? Is it because there are less distractions? In one hand there is LOCNAME, where there is so many distractions, like Sixth Street and parties. In the other hand there is Temple, where all my friends are and all of the hometown parties. I have no idea why I study better when I am at home. I hope these are questions that I can answer after taking this course. I have never wanted any thing as bad as I want a 0. 0 this semester and I don't know why. This is good for me, but why the sudden change. For some weird reason I can not quit asking the question, why do I want to study so much? The key word is want. I do not feel that I have to study, but instead I feel that I want to study. This is such a leap from where I was only a few months ago. Have I done myself harm by changing so rapidly? Will this wear off after I get accustomed to being in college? I hope that it does not, because I like the fact that I want to study and do well in school. Why did I not find this way of thinking in high school? If I had would it have made a difference? I am not sure what made me such a different person in high school, but I would love to know, what was the catalyst behind this tremendous change in my attitude. Is there anyway that I could have caused this change if I had wanted to? I do not think so. The jump from high school to college is what has caused me to be a better student. Why do we as humans look back at things that we have done in the past and wish we could change them? After all it was us that did them. How can we now look back at a situation and make a different decision? I tend to look back and wish to change things, but then I think to myself, that I was the one that made the decision in the first place. I don't know what causes me to look back so often, but I think that I reflect more often then others. Is it because I was happier at the time that I am reflecting? I feel the same know as I always have, but I am a more serious person. I am a happy and easygoing person, by nature, but when I am going to school, I feel more uptight than usual now. I used to look at school as a time to hang out with friends and goof off, but know there is none of that, I am only here for one reason, to do a good job. Hopefully this will carry over to when I get a job and am supporting a family. I think that this attitude will help me to be a very hard worker. I find it relieving to write as I just have for 00 minutes. Actually I went over the time because it was so interesting that I was thinking in this way. I did not know that I had so many questions about myself, until I sat down and wrote about them. I found it easy to ask myself questions without giving answers. Maybe after taking the Psychology class I will be able to answer some of my own questions. 
__label__label1 I am very tired. Actually I am not sure if I am tired or if I am just wanting to be tired. It almost seems strange but being tired is almost like a way out, or my ticket away from always having to be around people. I ma usually considered the very social one, whether it is with my friends or my family, but I have always been the one that should be so happy. I love country music. I remember that I used to listen to it all of the time when I was a freshman in high school. I think that I might have listened to it then because all of my new friends did and I wanted to be exactly like them. I also remember that PROPNAME used to listen to it. I guess it made me feel cooler when I could sing along to the songs in the car with everyone else. College is so weird and I miss my Mom and Dad so much. I got to see Mom today and it was so great, and now I really want to cry. I wanted to cry when she left, and now that she is gone I want to cry even more. I am not going to cry though because if someone walked in here then it would take forever and they would never leave because they think that they have to, and that they can somehow make me feel better and stop missing my parents. PROPNAME looked so cute today. She is getting older way too fast. Kind of reminds me of myself. She has a really bad temper though and I think that she got it from my mom. She is so damn smart though. I miss having that kid say weird things all of the time. Making me laugh. I have had really weird dreams lately. I think that PROPNAME must be really tired I wonder if he really only does like me that much when he is drunk. I have words sometimes. Sometimes I just really hate everything. I miss PROPNAME being able to tell me to go to sleep and everything would be better the next day in high school. PROPNAME has a new best friend now. Seems like everyone always has a very best, closest friend and I never really have just one. I am usually best friends with the guys. I guess that PROPNAME and I used to be inseparable very best friends, but being in LOCNAME LOCNAME will really tear two people apart. I really don't want to read my psychology. I want to read PROPNAME PROPNAME. I think that I almost make myself want to read because my mom loves it so much. I love my mom, and I miss going to camp. I need to stop missing things and take some of my advice to heart. I know what is right and wrong and I know the harsh facts of things coming and going in life. I wonder if the sophomore girls had fun this weekend while they were in LOCNAME. I think that that is pretty silly that they came up here for a whole weekend as a birthday party when they can't even go out, except to maybe like a movie. I wonder if LOCNAME is really crazy about PROPNAME and I wonder if PROPNAME has ever thought about getting with or dating PROPNAME PROPNAME. I miss high school. I miss my megaphone and my big blue bronco and being able to want to go to college. Last night I had really good margaritas. They would have been so much better if the were frozen. I want to meet PROPNAME PROPNAME. I hope that someday PROPNAME sings to me. I want to date PROPNAME. Not just get with him but date him. I always like one boy and try to date him and end up dating his best friend, but still wishing that I could date the other one. I wonder if King's girlfriend is really cute. PROPNAME is here. She is so much fun, she reminds me of PROPNAME PROPNAME but I seriously think that she is so much nicer than PROPNAME PROPNAME could have ever been. I really don't want to do this stupid assignment. I don't want to do this anymore. I could totally stop and come back and no one would ever know, but I am sure that there is some kind of point or something and I wonder if anyone is really going to ever read this I wonder how PROPNAME PROPNAME is doing. That boy never really changed since 0th grade. There are two ways to write 0th on this computer. I had so much fun walking on sixth street the other night with PROPNAME. It would be really cool if he would call me. I really was looking forward to coming to college and making a best friend that would be in my wedding and move to LOCNAME LOCNAME with me for no reason, and do fun things like shop for fruit and flowers and watch old movies. I don't think that I have found my real best friend yet. I wonder if people really think that you only have one mate out there waiting for you. I wonder if that is true. No one could ever prove that. The only person who knows things like that is God. My Dad is really close to God. I really do think that the closer you are to God the better your life is. You may not be famous, or always have the cutest clothes, but you will know what and who you love and what is important to you, and those few, simple things that are important will work out perfectly, they way God wants. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and things will never go wrong. I wish that I could sing. That would be so cool. I love to dance also, and I can't wait to try out for pom squad. I love being in front of everyone. I wonder how PROPNAME learned to work computers. That is a weird kid. I am really bad at computers, you can ask Mrs. PROPNAME about that one. Mrs. PROPNAME would love PROPNAME. She is so computer and gets everything done, and understand computers. What she doesn't understand she can figure out also. PROPNAME PROPNAME is really nice but I hate the fact that she is so pretty. I miss PROPNAME. I wish that I could decorate a room and rationalize as well as her. Lately I have not really been so tired. I have been running on about 0 to 0 hours of sleep a night, but it has been okay. I really think that I could look a lot better if I had been running and sleeping more. I think that in a while I am going to go jogging outside, but I better do it before it gets dark Inbox users: Get your email on your mobile phone Powered by InterMail from Software. comNew!

__label__label0 My mind is pretty tired right now, but I can't get it off of having a good dark cup of coffee. I have gotten all of my work for this week done already so I'm at ease about that. Whenever I type I have to look at the keyboard so it kind of pisses me off. Now I'll let my mind wonder, I sometimes think of home and all of my trashed out friends there. Have you ever wished you could help a person you care about a lot, and they just won't listen to you? Well my friends back home have been doing drugs heavily for a while and I cannot do anything about it. In a time where controversy and sex sell the theme, it's hard to decide which is the winning team. There are just some things in life we can't understand, like why in the hell we can fight over land. I think we all need a helping hand, so we can rise together and make a stand. At a time perfectly linked to your transition can you even tell me your position? No because 00% of us don't even listen and make the right choice for our provisions. I see a new generation with many faces. Bringing together people from many different places. I think discrimination is in our past, but I do not know how long that thought will last. It is a society we ourselves cast, and sometimes it seems like a supernatural blast. To think of all our generations drugs, hell I myself have been associated with thugs. But still we have a consensual love, and I don't even think it comes from above. My thoughts and feelings always rhyme so prepare yourself because it's my time. Fuck all of the bullshit and fabrication, for we are the ones who'll shape this great nation. So I do have a proclamation What do we do without an education and occupation? In a time when money and power mean everything, how in the hell do the bells of freedom ring? Sometimes I wonder about our future in store, and if we'll still neglect the poor. We have so many people locked in cells, it's almost as if we're under a spell. Cast by our so called forefathers, and I seem to be the only one it bothers. For evolution will always take its toll, look back at how we burned the totem pole. Who will burn us and how will we know? Until we're allowed to run our own show. Everyone is so quick to judge, and even quicker to hold a grudge. Just because we all have different views, doesn't mean we cannot find a use. So even though this shit won't sell, when will we wake up and demolish this hell? Our constitution is all of our rights, but it is changed everyday in the supreme court lights. Who are they to decide the meaning? I think we all see to which side it's leaning. Leaning towards more control over us, I think about it sometimes so much I want to bust. So when I say this I will not blush, Why are we in such a big fucking rush? 
__label__label1 I am really tired right now. Yesterday, PROPNAME (my roommate) and I went at 00:00 at night to PROPNAME PROPNAME to lift. I really have to use the restroom right now, so I will be right back. Sorry, I feel much better. My legs are so sore. I wonder what happens in a person's brain to tell his/her body that he/she needs to use the restroom. This TV next to me is really big, and I would like to turn it on right now, but I have more important things to do, namely writing this assignment. It would preoccupy me. I am really stressed out right now because I have so much going on. It gives me a headache. What causes headaches? Psychology is going to be a really fun course. I type really slowly, and I am trying not to look at the keys, but I am not doing a good job. My teachers are all great, and I lucked out with my math professor. He actually talks English. I wonder who ever thought of pencils and how they work. It is an amazing thing. Girls are wonderful  they make so happy. I have to maintain at least a 0. 0 to stay in the Business Honors Program, but I can do that if I really set my mind to it. Joining a fraternity would be so fun, but they are so expensive. My bed looks really comfortable. I always wonder if what we dream happens in reality later in life. LOCNAME vu is a feeling that I cannot explain. I have always wondered what happens inside the brain when this feeling occurs. I think that I have a slight obsessivecompulsive disorder because I want everything to be so neat and clean. I wonder if other people have this same feeling. I am always scared to talk about it in front of other people because I don't want them to think that I am weird. Who would have ever come up with the idea of the computer out of nowhere? They must have been brilliant. I feel a little lightheaded right now because I put a dip of ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in my lip. I hope that I can quit soon because I have been dipping since my freshman year in high school. My back is a little sore. I wish that I could go to sleep now, but I have to read some MIS 000 stuff. Psychology is a huge class. It has 000 people in it, and that is 00 more people than in my graduating class at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME last May. Well, it has been 00 minutes. Bye!  
__label__label1 Sometimes I wonder what everything is worth in the big scheme of things. Growing up, making friends, going to school, learning amazing things, falling in love, and well, I guess living in general. What is our purpose here. to consume as much food as possible on a daily basis, to desire nothing but to be rich, spoiled, to care not for our neighbors, but for what kinds of cars we drive. I wonder if that was His plan when this all started or if we've really messed up. In a sense, we've grown as far from following in his steps as possible and it's really scary to me. As a follower of the times, my faith in Him has also declined as the years have gone on. Well, on to another aspect of worthiness. friendships. Although necessary for life, and powerful while they last, why do all friendships seem to come to an end. Whether it is due to personal reasons or unplanned ones, each and every friendship must reach an end at some time. As I entered high school, I was very afraid of my future, of the immensity of my school, and the immensity of my life. But I realized that life is only as big as you make it. If you choose, you can have a closeknit group of friends or a large selection of various types of friends. its up to you. But back to my point. I made many friends in high school, but only a handful that will continue to have my friendship as I've moved to the next step in my life. My five best friends, my girlfriend, and a few others are only a hundredth of the people that I knew in my high school days, but now they are most likely out of my life forever, not by choice, but by nature. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited to be in college and out of high school, but I don't think that I realized what I was losing. My best friend with whom I spent countless days after school shooting hoops, watching movies, ordering pizza, and just hanging out decided to go to another school than me. I didn't realize how much I would miss him until he left. When I see him for the first time, it's going to be a relief, but when will that time come, and it's only going to last for short period of time. My girlfriend also chose another school, but hers was four states away. I knew leaving her would be most difficult, but I underestimated the pain. I miss seeing her every day and hearing about the intricate details of her life. what she had for breakfast, how her math test was, what she wore to school, when she got off work, how her family was, and many other little things that are often ignored when someone is around all the time. I feel like I don't know her as well as I used to and I wonder if I ever will. The leaving cut our relationship short, which also makes me wonder if our ever after will ever have a chance to grow. I guess the point of this is that sometimes we don't realize what we have until it's gone. and maybe realizing is worse, or maybe it's better, I don't know. Anyhow, I wonder why we're here, and maybe being away from everyone will help me figure it all out. But for now, I guess my hopes and dreams will drive me to care not what everything is worth, but to be happy that we get a chance to be here, happy we get a chance to grow up, make friends, go to school, learn amazing things, fall in love, and, of course, be alive! 
__label__label0 Well, today is my second day as a freshmen at ORGNAME. My fist class was at 0:00 in the morning and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought I wouldn't be able to understand the professor at all, but surprisingly I understood him very well and I understood what he was talking about. It was a review over stuff we were suppose to have learned already, and it was all so familiar to me. I guess I really did learn something last year in Calculus. I did have a really good teacher and I did well on the Calc AP exam. I have to remember to write a thank you note to my high school professor. He was the coolest. He was so passionate about what he was teaching and he really got me into what he was discussing. I understood it very well and actually enjoyed it too. I wish I had teachers like him in other subjects I took in HS. M economics teacher was not to good. It was an AP course too and I really felt that I didn't learn much. Now I'm going to take an economics class in college. I hope I get the same relaxed feeling as in my business Calculus class. The professor seems pretty cool. And maybe others in the class had not so good teachers too, so they are at the same disadvantage as me. Either way I'm going to study hard and stay on top of things in my class, so I can eventually do well. If there's one thing I learned in High ORGNAME, it's to stick with it. Starting out in high school, all I wanted was the easy way out, because the experience was so overwhelming to me and it was too scary. But at the end I started to see the big picture that in the end it is all worth it. In the end I will get a good grade trough all the hard work I put forth and then I can have that satisfied feeling that I did good and all my work paid off, so I must continue it. So I got in the habit of working my hardest and hoping to see the good result that are so satisfying to see. I usually get to see those results I so desperately work for but if not I work even harder the next time so I can finally see the results I was looking for. My High School was extremely competitive and I managed to keep up and just make it in the top ten percent. I'm very proud of myself, and where I am today. Many hispanic females such as myself with the same background are not as fortunate as me. In fact, most of my girl friends are working or going to a community college where I just don't see as much as opportunity as that which will be revealed to me at the ORGNAME ORGNAME School. Already I've been hearing in some of my classes that students tried out for the business school but didn't get in. That makes me feel so proud and honored for the position I am in. Other students have told me how hard they are trying to get into the business school. Again, I realize how lucky I am. I can't see myself majoring in anything else besides Business, maybe psychology, but that would be it. Psychology was my second choice for a major. I was that close to being a psychology major. So, now I know it was meant to be. I've had an accounting internship already, and I 'v e been to numerous business programs, which I have enjoyed very much. It brings me so much joy to say that I just may have found my niche because I know that this major includes all things that I enjoy. 
__label__label0 That is what I feel I should do first, is give you my social security number to make sure I get the grade for this assignment. Good thing this assignment is based on completion because at the rate I type I do not type much in the time span ORGNAME twenty minutes. I guess since just in my class alone there is on estimate 000 students in there all of which will be turning this assignment in this week sometime, it makes it practically impossible for you to read through everyone's writing even with the help of your teacher's assistance. You never really think about how many thinks and thoughts run through your mind in just the coarse of a few minutes. Your class schedule for that day, what assignments you need to get done, people you want to hangout with, and even the decision of if you want to do any of these things will cross your mind on a normal day of class with out you really even notice yourself thinking about these things. ORGNAME has been on my mind for the last few days especially. I have been trying to decide if I wish to play of the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME teams. While on this Thursday I have a tryout for the ORGNAME of ORGNAME Baseball ORGNAME. I guess I figure that I will see how the tryouts go for me on Thursday and make my decision. I really want to play for the UT baseball team but if that does not workout then the ORGNAME ORGNAME team will be the next best thing. I honestly have a good feeling about my talent and the way the coach sounded on having a good opportunity on making the team as a walkon. Right now just thinking about it gives me a adrenaline rush. Just think if I made it how exciting every game would be. It is a trill just watching a football game just think about it if all those people are in the stands and your apart of the team! Well my time is up so have a nice day. PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label1 I just started college last week. It's hard to believe I am finally here. I have been coming to LOCNAME for football games as long as I can remember, but I always go home when they are over. This time I am staying and my family is going home. It's so hard for me to think I will be spending the next four years here. It's so big and full of so many people. The first day of class I didn't know what to think. I was so overwhelmed by it all. I decided to go through rush here at LOCNAME, and that was an experience all on it's own. It was a week full of stress, and aching feet. You are surrounded by a bunch of girls that are trying to out do the next and you can't really tell if people are being fake or themselves. I just hoped for the best and tried to have fun. Now that it is all over and I made my bid. I was relieved a little, but not enough. The day after rush ended classes begin. I had no time to relax or get things together. I was stressing out more than I had ever before. I didn't know where my classes were, I missed my friends and family, my roommate and I have been a little off, it seemed like nothing was going right. I really wanted to cry. It's so hard for me to think that I am not happy here because I can vividly recall not too long ago saying that I couldn't wait to get out of high school and get to college. I was so excited about moving to LOCNAME. I didn't think I would miss my family too much because they would be coming down for all the home football games. Boy, was I wrong. I told everyone that I wouldn't think of going home my first weekend of college, but as I sat in my dorm room last Friday thinking about all my friends going home for the holiday I don't think I could have packed up my stuff any quicker. I was so excited about going home. I couldn't wait to get there. Even though I did homework and laid around most of the weekend it was very nice to just relax and not have to worry about anything. There are so many things to do in Austin and even when you say your not going out, someone is always trying to talk you into going somewhere. My past week of college has been fun, but scary. I am not use to being so unorganized. I need a schedule and a daily routine, so I won't feel so strung out and frazzled. So many things have been going through my head, about college and how I feel about it and I can't exactly put it all into words. When people ask me about school I don't know what to tell them. I wish I could say I love it and I am having a blast, but I would be lying. I have had fun, but I am kind of scared and homesick and I feel like I am in a maze and I can't find my way out. I don't think I am making any sense. My feelings are just all jumbled up and I can't seem to sort through them. I need direction. I am hoping every week will get better and I will gradually find my way and start to feel at home here. 
__label__label1 I am not sure if I am studying properly. Doing this makes me very nervous. I wish she would call me but I know it is hard. Sometimes it really sucks being in love. especially with someone my parents don't approve of. I wish I could escape sometimesto a place where no one judges anyone and everyone gets along and dad's don't drink. Where one can hear the sun rise and set; where stress is nonexistent and there's never any need to cry. I love to write, but not today. I want to sit in a tree and observe. Nobody would know I was there. Why are people so oblivious? We're really quite stupid. We hurt people and they hurt us. Nobody really wants to be hurt. My arms hurt. I really want to make this rowing team. I have to be part of something. I have been for 00 years. Why doesn't she come visit me. She is my backbonemy strengthI need her. I want to run away TO LOCNAME. That would be so great. LOCNAME is beautiful, peaceful and usually stays out of the limelight. Privacy. That would be so nice. She and I get along really well but it would be nice if I could have a little privacy every now and then. Well, a couple of days would be nice. I'm overwhelmed. I don't know what to do. about anything. I don't know who to talk to. I feel tired and unkempta lot. I wonder why. I love college though. I hated high school because I felt as if it were not to my level. Here there is a challenge. Flag football Wed. 00th. Today ultimate Frisbee. TomorrowApril. Test 00th speech. That mouse pad is black. Why am I dizzy sometimes. I need to write. Seriously write. Like I used to. It always made me feel so much better. and my teachers loved it. What on earth is this chick next to me doing? I really HATE it when people look at my monitor when I am trying to do this. PET PEAVE. Or when there are like 000 computers open and she has to come sit right next to ME. I like lightning. It's so beautiful. I like rain. I want to go play in it. I don't ever want to grow up. I hope this phone doesn't get me in trouble. I really need to get my computer fixed. It's so dead. So am I. But not too bad. Not as bad as I have been. I really have a lot of questions about God. I really need to get them answered because all of it is driving me absolutely out of my mind. Maybe I'll hang around after church on Sunday. ask the pastor. Maybe not. I hope my mother is happy with him. She deserves to be happy after everything she's been through. I'm glad they found each other again. I need to workout. It keeps me strong and in shape. April needs to be happy. She tries so hard to make me happy but I don't want her to. She needs to make herself happy. PROPNAME needs to lay off. I need to go home. 
__label__label0 I'm pretty out of it right now, still pretty sleepy. But I know I've got to do this since it's due in 0 hours. I can feel the onset of a headache, I don't know why. I think I've gotten enough sleep. Maybe it's because I haven't eaten enough. As soon as I 'm done, I'm going to pig. I'm kind of worried about my classes. I've already missed more than I should. I haven't missed any psychology but that's only because it's only twice a week and, more importantly, it doesn't start 'til 0:00. It's my latest class; all my rest are earlier in the morning. I've had a lot of trouble getting up. However, I think I can manage to catch up. I don't think I've missed anything terribly important. My lip is feeling a little funky right now. I got it pierced a few days ago. I really can't say why I did it. Maybe to set myself apart from others, maybe because I'd never done anything like it, maybe because I'm a teenager and I'm "rebelling. " I think I deserve to, too, since I don't drink, smoke, or do anything like that. I don't know how my parents are going to feel about it. Obviously, they're not going to be happy. But I don't think they can get too upset. Like I said, I stay away from all the alcohol and stuff like that that is rampant in college, so hopefully they'll allow me this one thing. I think I've been a pretty decent kid. I've also been taking care of my lip so it doesn't get infected so they shouldn't have to worry about it. Plus, my brother got a tattoo his first semester up here and I think that's more dangerous, especially since he got it on his spine. One thing that has me really nervous was caused by my own stupidity. I was over at my friend's house last night and he'd bought a doityourself haircut kit. Me, wanting to save a few bucks, gave it a shot on myself. Well, to trim my sideburns, I took off the clipper thing and just left the razor which is about a "0. " Anyway, I go to the other room to ask my friend how it's looking. He says it's all right but needs a little work. So I go back to the sink, pick up the clipper and proceed to run it up the back of my head. Immediately, from the sound, I could tell that I'd forgotten to put the #0 clipper on; it was still on "0. " Now, I've got a bald spot on the back of my head. I really started freaking out. People would think I was a freak. I wasn't going to shave my head, but I had my friend fix it up as beast he could but it's still pretty obvious. Now, I've got to wear a hat backwards for at least a week so no one will notice. I'm pretty selfconscious. If I thing there's something wrong with my looks, it becomes pretty hard for me to talk to people I don't know. Which sucks since I'm already pretty shy and since I'm still trying to meet new people. It looks like the twenty minutes are up now. I hope I did this assignment right. 
__label__label1 I am sitting here wondering as to why I chose to do this assignment at this particular time. As I search my the thoughts the number one reason I can find is BOREDOM. I am so bored right now, as I have throughout my entire UT experience. I miss my friends, my family, my surroundings, my house, and most of all, my king size water bed. I have nothing against my roommate, my dorm, or this college, but I feel that they cannot replace the friends, accommodations, and schools that I have become accustomed to over the past 00 years. I'm pretty sure that I just used a runon sentence. Five minutes down, fifteen to go. Notice that I spelled out the words "FIVE" and "FIFTEEN" in order to waste. I am wasting this time because I don't feel any need to be introspective. I feel that I know myself pretty well, both strengths and weaknesses, I that I have no need to further analyze my thoughts. I am very surprised how painless that has bee thus far. I'm sure that my high school English teachers would die when if they saw how many sentences I started with "I". Although you can not see this, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, it just took me about eight tries to correctly spell the word "saw". Did you notice that I also spelled out the word EIGHT. It has now been twelve minutes and it is time for a short bathroom break. I hope that this writing is still here when I come back. I'm back. That took about a minute. Sorry. I meant to right ONE minute. I wonder what other people are writing for this assignment. I wonder how many people will try to suck up by complementing the professor, or how many will tell of their dislike for this class? I wonder how many will try to be introspective and artistic, and end up writing free verse poetry? I feel that such people, who think themselves to be deep and philosophical, are the exact opposite, fake and shallow. I feel that my fingers are not fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. As this assignment comes to an end I wonder what I was supposed to have learned, for I feel that I am none the wiser. TWENTY minutes have now passed. The END. 
__label__label1 I really don't now exactly what to write. my mind is just blank. I met this really hot guy at my dorm and I want to keep talking to him. he doesn't remind me of PROPNAME PROPNAME at all but what can I say. my vision is blurred today probably because of the ozone warnings. I can't believe that it was 000 degrees the other day. I wish that I would have made the dance team, but I guess I knew that I wouldn't. I really want to change my major. I hate ballet with a passion and today I felt sick to my stomach in class because I hate it so much. brandon makes me so mad because he acts gay all the time. what is up with him and jennifer, why don't they just date or something. I wonder if jen really likes jansen or what. I really want a boyfriend. I dreamed about kevin last night and it was so weird because he was actually being nice. I was sick and in the hospital or something and he was taking care of me. I want to meet justin timberlake so bad. I just want to have sex with him. I miss my brother and I can't believe that my father hasn't called me in over 0 months. And he didn't even come to my graduation. ugh. I really don't like my classes and I already have trouble getting myself to class. I am such a bad student. I wonder where sammy is today? I really want him back but that will never happen. I pretend that there is a chance but I am kidding myself now that he is with mrs. perfect. jen lovey. I don't know that pisses me off so much I want to scream. I think it was the same guy in class today that said mating choices that asked who was single the first day. I will have to go and meet him. I'm hungry and I feel extremely fat. I was thinking today about why people swing their arms when they walk. that reminds me of seinfeld and when PROPNAME makes fun of the woman who doesn't swing her arms. I think I like patobut I'm not really attracted to him. I wonder if you can actually like someone as in love if you aren't attracted to them. maybe I am and I just don't want to admit it. the mind is so weird. It psychs you out to think one thing but then you get all confused because you don't know if that is what you really think. that was complicated. I feel bad that I have not made time for God in my life and I want to but then I find fun things to do and forget. I need to pray about that. I can't wait to meet the man that I'm going to marry. I'm looking at this picture of my best friend from high school and not one thought comes to my head. sometimes I think that it was good we went our own ways because we were getting tired of each other. I feel bad for casey and I really need to call daniel. patrick is the rudest boy in the world. I don't think he has ever been nice to me. Oh well his loss. I am so broke right now. I need to get a loan but the stupid texas thing is gay and won't work. I wonder if my finger is broken or not. I can't decide if I want to try out for the ut dance team or not. what is up with all my homework. I never have a life anymore. I think I'm really going to hate school. maybe I will drop out and go back home and work at heb. my life is going nowhere. its not like I'm actually going to dance on broadway so what's the point of even trying for it. I hate writing journals for dumb modern class. That's a bunch of crap. this school is so messed up with all its procedures and freaking lines that are always miles long. my feet are killing me. I need to go to the chiropractor. where is melissa. what is she doing? I'm thinking that this is the easiest writing assignment I've ever done. my English teacher mrs. dillard ran away with another teacher and got married and I never saw her again. that was strange. and my dad did that too. he told me in a mexican food restaurant and I wanted to kill him. oh and the orange drink that we used to drink and the wasp that was trapped in the house and I started crying. my dog died when I was little. I miss my cat at home but I don't want to go home and see my mom. she will drive me crazy. brittney spears is such a hoe. if she slept with justin that is gross. I want to meet him and ask him. I think I will. LOCNAME is going to be tight. the drive sucks but to meet him I would do anything. man I just want to know what it would be like to kiss him. ohhhh, dang I can't wait. I want to talk to zal. I wonder if he is back from paris yet? I think I'm don't know so yeah. 
__label__label0 I came back to my home town for Labor Day. I didn't really want to, but my friend talked me into coming with her. I've only been gone a week and I'm already back. Why? I'm not home sick. I guess I just didn't want to stay in LOCNAME when everyone I knew was leaving. I hope PROPNAME made it to the airport. I'm really worried about him right now. I pray for his mom to get better but I just don't know. I want to promise him everything is going to be alright but I just can't. I wish he would stop drinking to make the pain go away but I guess if it makes him feel better right now. Who am I to tell him what to do anyway? I wonder what time PROPNAME's game is tomorrow. My mom told me but I forgot. Maybe I should have gone to LOCNAME this weekend. I don't know? I think anything's better that being in LOCNAME. Football is such a big thing here. Of course the first thing we do is go to PROPNAME's football game as soon as we got here. I'm glad PROPNAME doesn't do anything as dangerous as that I already worry about him enough. I really think we are maturing in our relationship, learning to work through problems that most couples don't ever have in their entire lives. I don't know what he's going to do if he loses her too. I know she wants to be with his dad but isn't it selfish to leave your children. Catherine just came in here to ask me what time I was going to get up. I said 00 but that wasn't early enough so we decided on 0:00. I am very happy with my schedule because I don't have a class before 0:00 and I like all of them. One thing about school I hate is that I'm always so tired. Why can't I check my stupid email from my house? You would think a major computer system at a major university would have some way you could check it without having to download this and that. You should be able to enter your IF or UTEID and open a link site, but no. Nothing is that easy. I hate computers and if I never had to use one I wouldn't mind a bit, but if I didn't know how I couldn't pass any of my classes. That is another thing. Why is everything I need for a class on the internet? I feel sorry for people who have no clue how to use it. I thought PROPNAME was never going to hook up her computer but she finally discovered she had no choice. Computers are our lives these days. What would the human race do without them? It's scary you know, our whole life is on this thing and if they know what their doing, anyone could find some thing you don't want them to have. 
__label__label0 Right now I am sitting in my dorm room and I just got off the Internet with my old boyfriend, PROPNAME. He is still in LOCNAME and I feel as if part of me is still there with him. The worst of it all is that he has a new life now and he is finding new people and new things to do. Since he is doing this he has found every way to make it very clear that I am not to be a part of this new life he is enjoying so much. Although there is no room for me in this life there is plenty of room for tons of other girls that understand what he is going through. I don't really think that it is fair for him to expect me to just sit here and let him make a new life for himself that I am not in, but he does not seem to understand that because the only circumstance he sees is that I am in college in LOCNAME and that my life must be better than his so there is no need for me to be a part of his boring life in LOCNAME. I pretty much do not think that PROPNAME is that great and I would trade being in college to be with him in a heartbeat. I do not think that he is being fair, sympathetic or a good friend to me at all. He doesn't seem to understand that college is a scary thing and that it really helps to know that there is someone there for you that is a steady constant in your life during a time of constant change, such as this one. He just doesn't understand, and he just doesn't really care. All that he really cares about is that he is having a good time, which obviously cannot involve me. The only thing that he can ever see is that I am in college and that there is going to be so much distance between the two of us. The only thing that he seems to able to do about this is to put even more distance between the two of us. This really bothers me. And the worst of it is that I have been gone for a total of seven days and he has already found a way to replace the void I have left in his life. It makes me feel very wanted to know that I can be replaced in seven days. And the worst of it is that I totally want to be with him every moment of every day and he just doesn't want to be. I feel that if I were to come home for a weekend that he wouldn't even have the time to see me because he would be so busy with some other person. He doesn't even have the time to talk to me for five minutes yet he has time to go to bible study for three hours. He doesn't understand how unwelcoming that college is and how much I would like to have someone right now that really wants me to be there and that really cares about me. This whole situation is very difficult because we are so far apart and there is no way to see each other and there is no way to make him see how much I care about him or how much I really want to be a part of his life. And on top of all of my turmoil with him, I also had to go through rush this week and not get into a sorority. This all makes me feel very wanted and liked by others. So basically my first week of college has been pretty good. I am sick, I have all eight o'clock classes and I am not a morning person, I have been replaced in the life of one of the few people I have ever truly cared for, I have been cut by sororities even though all of the girls in my town have joined the houses of their choice, I live in a really tiny old dorm with a bunch of weird people, and I have broken the brand new portable telephone in my bedroom. Oh well, it can only get better form here, right?  
__label__label0 I'm somewhat in question with the purpose of this assignment. I'm in a hurry, with places to go and things to do; once again I leave things to the last moment. My 00 minutes will be up and then I will find myself fleeing out the door to make my next objective of the day. Duty from 00, and then the notsoceremonious, colors ceremony. I wonder who codes the script for these pages. Is it Dr. PROPNAME himself who makes the web pages for his own classes; I doubt that all the professors are even somewhat proficient in HTML, needless the mention all the complicated CGI scripts that must be involved with all these online forms. So long as you have a working understanding of how CGI/Java/html works, with an updated WYSIWYG web page creator, it is not all too difficult to create and publish your own web page. My topic flows from one to another as quickly as the minutes roll by while typing this assignment. The lectures of this class are interesting, even entertaining (imagine that), though I'm worried on the difficulty of the test. We have covered a great deal of material from the book, most of which was only very vaguely covered in class. Most of the concepts so far are somewhat familiar to me. I took psych my junior year in High School with a very good teacher. He used every moment that was allocated in his classes to make sure we absorbed as much knowledge as possible. He was dedicated to his work, and would compel us to be dedicated to ours. This is of course Friday, and while I was supposed to be free after noon today, I find that my ROTC obligation will keep me occupied at least until 0000. I'm beginning to realize just how much time this is taking up from me; it will be a struggle to maintain any academic performance that I have begun in my classes. I have taken either tests or exams in all but this class. The computers are down so I don't know what my grade is yet, and I don't have enough time to check with the correction sheet on the website to calculate my grade myself. Well, my twenty minutes is almost up, just a few more to go. I haven't really written much, nor has my writing kept any cohesive thought or substance to it, but I suppose that's what's to be expected from something like this. I don't know what this is supposed to convey about me or my personality, but whatever it is, I probably wouldn't want to know anyway. And now I'm off to finish the rest of my day. 
__label__label0 As I begin this assignment, I'm not sure what to say. I really never write my thoughts down. Maybe I should. I want to play halflife, but I can't. It seems I don't have enough hours in the day to do everything I want to. Maybe I should be better in my time management. But I think I'm pretty good as it is. I always try to plan out my day, making sure I have enough time for everything. Shoot, I can't believe I misplaced my bracelet, PROPNAME gave it to me. She's so sweet. There's a speck of dust on my calendar. I better pick it up and throw it away. I've made a pact with myself to learn how to type correctly on a keyboard. No cheating whatsoever. It is really weird. But I think I'll grasp it eventually. I was just thinking about my trumpet. I', not in any band here, but I still like playing my horn. I just wish I had the time for it. That really pisses me off. Hopefully, after I firmly get adjusted, I can figure something out. I was just thinking about PROPNAME, when I went to his place a couple of nights ago. He's such a funny son of a bitch. I had a good time. I wish his place had better lighting, though. its too dark. But I like the living room action. This dorm is very restrictive; I can't wait until I get an apartment. I'm sick of walking to a dining hall for food. And I really want to eat meals with meat in them. I got to finish my math work. Maybe I'll invite PROPNAME over again, PROPNAME's coming over after 0:00. I just have a couple of problems to work out, but then there is the new section. I probably should do most of that tonight so I can ask the TA some questions. That one guy got number 00. But he'll be there tomorrow, so that's cool. Man what's that other guy's name  yellow hat boy  Starts with a G, PROPNAME or something. I checked my answers with him this morning. Most of them were right, thank God. I just hope I can pull something good in this class. I'm determined to work hard. God willing, I won't end up like some of my friends. Man I'm tired. I always seem tired. I don't know why. Four more minutes. this backspace key next to the spacebar is so convenient. I don't have to pick my hand up whenever I make a mistake. That just goes to show how lazy I am. Mofo action lazy. I got a reply from PROPNAME today, I was so glad, I miss him, I miss a lot of people. I guess it's going to take me a while to find people like those I left behind in high school. They were so good in so many ways. There's music playing. oh well, time's up. 
__label__label0 What should I write about?. Anything that pops into my head? Okay. Well, I have to write PROPNAME email and via snail mail. I told him I'd send the pictures, his copies, of our trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME. That was one fun and exciting weekend. I miss him so much. I think of him as much as I do about PROPNAME. But PROPNAME more so, of course. I can't wait to see PROPNAME again. Mom's cooking really smells good. She's cooking Filipino beefsteak and my mouth is watering. The watercolor picture on the front cover of the PSYCHO text is quite unusual. Looks like one of PROPNAME's works, but the facial features aren't misplaced. Hmmmm. how much more time do I have? Eh, five minutes have passed. fifteen more minutes to go. I keep thinking about ORGNAME and the internet. I have to catch up with my email writing and AFLS posts. I rarely post in the newsgroup anymore. There are so many newbies and the people in there are rather annoying. PROPNAME posts there, though. That's really nice of her. Very thoughtful lady. But what busts my buttons the most are the continuously unending flow of questions, personal or otherwise, that particular people tend to ask. They probably know more about PROPNAME than they do about themselves. They're so obsessed. I just want to tell them off and give them a piece of my mind, but I'm not that type of person. I like writing this way. It's like a diary or a journal of some sort. I should do this more often. It's quite relaxing. I used to keep a diary. I'd tell it everything, especially how I felt about PROPNAME when I was younger. about 00 or 00 years old or so. I had the biggest crush on him, to this day, but he never knew back then. He liked me, too, big time. It was only a few weeks ago, when I saw him after 00 years that I confessed. We were both sad that we were never really together, but that night felt like we had been together all this time. for the longest time. It felt so natural  he said so himself. I could replay that weekend for the rest of my life. And we shared so many common interests that I never knew we had before. My, what a story we have. It's like a long lost love affair. This writing assignment is pretty neato. Just writing down thoughts. Putting it into words. I could write a whole novel. HAHA! I'm still thinking of PROPNAME. But, alas, I am in love with someone else, also a boy from my childhood. I didn't really know him back when I was 00 years old. His family, yes, but not him. It's only during high school that I got to know him and later on fall head over heels for him. It wasn't love at first sight, you see, as in PROPNAME's case. I eventually fell for PROPNAME and I will remain faithful and loving to him for as long as I shall live. Should I end here? I've got one more minute. Well, it's at least 00 minutes, but I feel like writing more. My mom's cooking smells great. Well, time's up but I'll keep on writing. I need to go to the bathroom, too. So, until next time. This is confidential right? Now, where's that submit button? 
__label__label0 This semester should be one where I define the rest of my life. Working as hard as possible to get into the school of architecture. It is what I have wanted to do for the past 0 years. The fact that I was initially rejected brought me down. But I can't let that hold me down. Hopefully psychology will help me sort out my thought processes. My roommate is being very helpful right now by blurting out random words and playing decent music. I'm pretty fortunate to have a good friend like him. I have known him for the past 0 years. I am also fortunate for having good professors this semester. I don't really have a monotone stiff up on stage reciting the book word for word. I am also fortunate that the girl next to me in psychology class is hot. Hopefully something will come of it. If not there are about 00,000 other cute girls running around on this great campus. I thought this was going to be easy but so far I just can't seem to talk about much. That it was I hate about myself is that I am too shy around people I don't know. People I don know think I am loud and very extroverted but around strangers I don't know how to initiate conversation. There are times though when I don't really care and I seem to make friends with everyone. I have a lot of reading to do but I thought I might as well get this out of the way. I used to do this type of thing in my 00th grade English classes. Mr. PROPNAME was so cool. My old high school wasn't very good. I guess that is why I only went there for 0 years. I bet there are about 0 million mistakes in this paper once I am done typing this. The psychology textbook is pretty easy reading. That is such a relief because I need to work as hard as I ever had in my entire life and I probably couldn't do it if the books were terrible. I think that after this semester of busting my ass I t help bring me into a routine of busting my ass and making a 0. 0 over the next years will come natural. I believe that the harder you work the better the pay off. Architecture is a field of tremendous work. I have worked with a guy for the past two years. It so good. I have learned more on the job than I think I will ever learn in any classroom. It was a job I was looking forward to going to every morning. He gave me a lot of responsibility this past summer. I was able to organize the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME fundraiser where I happened to meet a lot of influential people in the society. How much longer do I need to type? This is lasting longer than I thought it would. I guess my head is just empty. I think while doing this I try to hard to put on this thing that I think you want to hear. But since it is just a free thought paper I should just be able to write whatever I want. But for some reason it just isn't happening. I think way too much about things that keep me up at night. I often lie in bed until 0 in the morning just thinking I will be in the next 00 years. I have always had the dream of making it big and becoming some architect who becomes immortal thought his outstanding designs and buying my parents whatever they have always wanted. I think that making my parents proud of me is my ultimate goal in life. Just once to here my dad say, "that's my son" in front of a whole crowd of people and for him o be so proud of what I have become and done is the greatest thing in the world. Hopefully I went let him down that is why I come to class. That is why I have to college. This is why I am reading and turning this assignment in days early. I will do whatever needs to be done to get to the top. If I don't I have not only let myself down but my parents as well. But I won't let that happen. This is the place an time to make or break my future and I don't plan I on coming away from the university with anything less then I what I came here for. I will be the best and I will make my parents proud. Time is almost up I thin. I guess this has been good for me. Even though no one will probably ever read this I know it has been a vent. These are things no one has ever heard me say. So take car of it. Times up teach, talk to you later. 
__label__label1 I really don't have a clue what to write about but I guess I'm supposed to think of what I'm feeling which is that my tank top's straps are really bugging me because they keep falling down and I keep looking at the pictures on my desk instead of the screen and what I am writing my refrigerator keeps making an annoying buzzing sound but I am concentrating on it anyway since I have to keep in touch with my senses. I keep staring at these pictures like I'm afraid to look at the screen or something it is a picture of me and my two friends from high school in our bathing suits acting like morons. there is also a lot of dust on my desk and on the picture frames and I really think I should clean them off, but I am pretty lazy so I doubt I will do that there is dust on everything around my computer!. the printer, the keyboard, the mouse pad, the phone and the pictures. my neck keeps itching; its probably from the dust or something. I can't believe I've only been typing for three minutes. this is going to be a very long paper, but this assignment is definitely a lot more fun than all the other ones in my other classes. uhoh the phone is ringing and I don't know whether to pick it up or not! I guess I can't because that would be breaking the rules! so I didn't and now it stopped and a really loud voice came on the answering machine of course the message wasn't for me I already had my really really good and nice phone calls for the day. I guess you could call me one of those losers that really misses home. I miss my boyfriend and my friends in the picture on my desk and my dad. and I miss my mom, but she's not at home, at least not technically because she's dead. this should be interesting to see where this thought leads because I have noticed in myself that whenever I think about my mom my brain won't let me and it starts thinking about something else like what I will wear tomorrow or something totally irrelevant. my mom was nice and I have a picture of her in my room but I can't really see it from where I am now because it's above my bed it makes me sad to think about her and when I do, like now, it makes me want to cry. I think that my brain realizes I will be too sad when I think about it so it won't let me. that is kind of nice of it, but sometimes when I just want to think about it, it won't let me. now my wrists are hurting from typing so fast for so long and my back is itching and it is getting very hot in here our room is always hot. my mom was always hot and we had to keep our house freezing cold nobody wanted to come to my house in the winter because it was so cold. it didn't matter this past winter, though, because she wasn't alive and I could turn the heat up if I wanted to because no one would yell at me for doing it. My dad would sometimes, but he doesn't really care. He'll yell at me to put on a sweater or something because I am costing him too much money when I can just put a sweater on but my dad is nice, not as nice as my mom, but he wasn't as understanding or shy as her. when she first died he was very understanding about everything but now he is the same as he always was there is a picture of us above my bed that I can see well it is of us dancing at my brother's wedding like ten years ago we were really happy then and we are now, too, I guess he just got married again so there was some tension there but its gone now for the most part, despite what he says. he is in LOCNAME now with his new wife because that is where she's from and her dad is dying so they went to see him. I liked her dad; he was a funny Irish guy he has cancer; it seems that everyone dies of cancer, although my mom didn't. my mom died because of an incompetent fire rescue ambulance squad and bad cop who will go to hell when he dies, hopefully. it bothers me that I am so bitter about him and the ambulance squad but I can't help thinking that my mom would still be alive if it weren't for them. now I only have five minutes left to go I am extremely itchy I am never this itchy in any other given twenty minutes, I guess its just the stress of actually having to think about my thoughts. the people outside are being so loud and annoying you think that if you were on the ninth floor you wouldn't hear stuff on the ground so far below, but you can. I keep going from staring at the pictures to staring at the screen; I'm afraid to look anywhere else I guess so now I am just sitting here listening to the people outside, enduring my itches, and thinking about how I've almost written a whole entire page on absolutely nothing relevant. I guess some parts were relevant because they made me pay attention to my surroundings and what my brain actually thinks I think it will be cool to go back and reread this. this was a fun assignment except my wrist really hurts now and my arms are sagging like how they tell you not to do on the anticarpel tunnel syndrome commercials and papers. but I only have one minute left now and I can't wait because my wrists are hurting and I don't think they can take much longer. I haven't typed in so long unless you consider email a valuable typing time which I don't because my emails are never a page and some long! ow. ow ow ow. those people are s 
__label__label1 I have to go to the SI unit and then the Crew meeting and come home, shower, get ready, and meet PROPNAME and LOCNAME for dinner. I should have some time tonight to do homework. I'm still tired from last night, maybe I can take a nap sometime today. Otherwise, I can always sleep in tomorrow. Having only afternoon classes will be interesting. My lab might be hard because it's at night, but it seems really lax. It's such a difference from the chem labs. I'm so glad it doesn't seem hard at all. I hope my physics lab is easy as well. One can only hope. Not having lab the first week is nice. It worked out well so I could be home to help my parents help move our stuff. It's such a pain to have to move when school is already in session. I'm a little shocked the manager didn't have us sign the lease before we moved in. I hope that's not an indication ORGNAME how much she cares about the renters. At least there's a lady downstairs who has lived here for 00 years that knows everything about this place. It's so nice having an apartment right next to a bus stop. I think it's fate we moved in here. After all the hassles we've had it looks like its going to be worth it. I still have to hang up all my clothes, but everything else is done. I can't forget to meet PROPNAME at 00am on Monday in the ORGNAME to work on physics homework. It's 0 pages long. I hope it's as easy as the first homework. It still took a while to finish though. From 0pm to 0am. This time I'll start earlier. I'm glad that my sister is coming in town, but she picked a bad weekend. I have a lot of reading to do and 0 tests to study for. I need to start seriously studying the PCAT. I can't believe I almost missed the deadline on that again. This is ridiculous. I hope I get into ORGNAME ORGNAME. That's the only place I'd really like to go. Except maybe ORGNAME or ORGNAME of ORGNAME. ORGNAME is probably too expensive. I'd want to live in LOCNAME LOCNAME when I have money so really I only want to got o Pharmacy school in LOCNAME or LOCNAME. The only thing about LOCNAME is I hope PROPNAME has gotten cleaner. I know she never cooks anymore, so probably. We'd have to get a bigger place than what she has now and I might just have to leave all my stuff here and buy new stuff. That's going to be expensive. I hope whatever happens, Mom and Dad aren't disappointed in me. They need a web page for ORGNAME so I know when I need to get in line and for what. The draw system for the football team is so much more efficient, even though they don't give out all the information I need either. Maybe next year I won't buy either. It's so much of a pain. I don't even feel like going. I bet that's how they make their money. I don't know about the plays, but at the games students get crappy seats. I know they were trying to improve that, I wonder if that went through. Probably not. As a whole, LOCNAME just cares about money and not the poor students. That's why alumni get everything. Good luck to the "sick" staff. 
__label__label1 Okay, I'm starting. I did assignments like this in freshman English back in high school. It was pretty cool. Mrs. PROPNAME was a great English teacher, but she scared me sometimes, like when she would yell at one of the kids in class to prove a point about what we were learning in class. I really liked that class. I liked the books we read. We were reading PROPNAME PROPNAME, and one of her points she made was over censorship, she took the book away from us. We couldn't even go to the school library to finish it. I guess she got her point across. Another point she made was no matter how little time given for an assignment, you can get it done. Before we read Animal Farm, she split us up into groups, sheep, pigs, dogs, chicken, and we had to have a campaign. This just wasn't any campaign, we really had to work for it. Make up slogans, flyers, songs, costumes, bribes. you name, we were graded on it. We were allowed to decorate all the halls with our flyers. It became really big, Mrs. PROPNAME and her campaigns. It just kept getting bigger every year. I guess you could say the incoming freshman were getting crazier each year. I didn't really care, each year that went by was closer to me getting away from there. I can't stand it back home. I knew everybody in my school, and they all knew me, so tell my how I ended up with only a handful of people who would talk with me during lunch. I wasn't rude to people. least I don't think I was. Oh, well, I'll never see most of those people again in my life. Yippee! No, that's not the least bit sarcastic. I think sarcasm is a certain type of humor. Only certain people can do it, and only certain people think it's funny. I had to deal with sarcasm all the time in my family. I don't understand how some people say they come from a broken family. Your family doesn't necessarily have to be split up to feel like you've come from a dysfunctional family. I have to live with what my father does, and so does my mom and brother. Big deal, we make it through one day at a time. Like today, I just stopped worrying and went to a concert. It was pretty cool, although I wish I'd gone with someone who wanted to go up into the mosh pits. I know they're dangerous, but, come one, they're fun and you get to get close to the bands. I also went to a concert on Friday night. That one was cooler. The lead band was so cool. The singer was dancing around stage so crazily. It was a really neat experience for me. Only seven more minutes to go. No, I'm not counting. There goes that sarcasm again. Once, for junior English, my teacher had us try what PROPNAME PROPNAME did to better himself, keep a record of all our vises and try to improve upon them. Guess which one was my weak point? Yep, sarcasm and meanness. I can't help it, it's in my nature. I'm not a mean person, I just see things sometimes in a mean way. And you have to voice it, otherwise it just stays inside and festers and then you do become mean. Right? At least that's my superstition. I don't normally go in for superstitions, but this one sounds good for me. Oh, and I say 'Bless you' when someone sneezes, I think it's just polite, I don't believe in the scaring the demons away. I think that's a bunch of bullshit. Man, I can't wait to graduate. I really want to fly helicopters. That's what I'm going to do when I get out of college. Go into the ORGNAME and fly helicopters. It should be really neat. I know neat isn't quite the word I'm looking for, but somehow, I don't think awesome would be appropriate in a paper I'm turning in for a grade, even though you're not going to read it. 
__label__label1 I'm so tired both physically and mentally. I just want sleep, sleep, sleep. I'm so overwhelmed with everything and I can't seem to think of anything but my future. I focus more on how my life might be in the future than how my life is presently. I just feel that it's going to take forever to get where I want to be in life. I don't know why I bother with the future when I have so many things to overcome right now. I just wish I knew how it felt to be completely satisfied. Although, I don't think that is possibleto be completely satisfied. It would make my life seemingly unnatural. What is natural to me are headaches. They are a natural result of stress; stress that is the result of my acknowledgment of my shortcomings. I just want to be truly content with myself and with my life one day. I don't know if that is possible, but I'd like to think so. 
__label__label0 Well, the twenty minutes start now. It feels strange having to write out what I am thinking. Seeing as how I've never had a diary or journal, I've never had to do this before. Funny how your mind draws a blank when you are supposed to be writing what you are thinking at that very instant. A whole minute has gone by and I can not think of anything to type. I guess that's kind of the purpose. don't think ahead for once, just let everything come out just as quickly as it comes in. all day long, my mind has been jumbled up with. well, stuff, and now I can't seem to remember what all the "stuff" was. Gosh, it's early and I'm already tired. It's not that today was stressful, just very hot and tiring. I can't wait until the weather finally cools off. I wish I could sleep in tomorrow. I wish I could go to sleep now. I hope what I actually write isn't important. After all, it's only a completion grade, right? I hope so. Sigh. Now that I'm thinking about it, this class kind of worries me, after 0 class days in here, I'm still not sure what to study or what to write down in my notes, the TA at the supplemental instructions class, I can't remember her name at the moment, says that we should pay attention to the book and the notes. But I think we wanted a more concise answer. My philosophy class is exactly the same. No body knows what to write in their notes, after all, all the notes we take are basically made up of questions. I'm a bit nervous about my first test in that class. And we are only going to have three, and that's counting the final. It has its good and bad points I guess. Double standard. Since I've started college, it seems like everything is a double standard. I don't live on campus that has its good and bad points. Umm, what else? Lots of things. hard to come with them right now. Dang, I still have to read for my writing class. ugh, that book is boring, I hope I don't fall asleep reading it again. More than likely I will seeing as how I'm sleepy right now. I think I should just read tomorrow while I'm on the shuttle to school. That'd be good. Oh, I can't. I have to get on the early bus tomorrow, it's going be too packed to be able to concentrate. Guess I have to read tonight. Oh well. Gosh, I'm tired. Wait. My mom always calls when I'm in the middle of something. Weird. Why did she need my schedule? I bet so she could call when she knows I'm not in class. I know this sounds bad, but I don't want to talk to her everyday. Every time she calls, she sounds like she's upset with me. I think she's mad because I left home. But it's not like I went out of the country, or out of state for that matter. I'm only 0 hours away, and I'm going home this weekend to visit anyway. She doesn't have reason to be upset with me. She's supposed to happy and proud. It was always hard to make her proud. Nothing ever seemed good enough for her. But not my dad, he's different. As long as I tried, my dad was always proud of me; I love him for that. Well, there goes my timer. 00 minutes is up. Thank you. 
__label__label0 I don't feel like going to class today, but because I paid a great amount of money for this education I might as well. But wait, it's a discussion class for Calculus, oh well, it's not like I understood anything what Dr. PROPNAME was saying yesterday in class. Do I really have to walk all the way over there? If I don't go, I can spend some of that time studying for a chemistry test tomorrow, as well as download some more songs off the Internet. The chemistry test is my first test and I don't how Dr. PROPNAME makes her tests. But because it's over the first two chapters, which were basically a review of chemistry in ORGNAME ORGNAME, hopefully, it might be easy. I sure hope so! Ahhh. school, it's getting on my nerves. Let this week calm down, it'll be okay next week. I can't wait until the weekend. On my gosh, I have 00 minutes until my next class, what should I do? Sleep, nahh. what if I oversleep, that would be bad. I guess I should start packing my books and looking for my keys to lock the room, which by the way, I really don't understand why the lock on the door opens when you turn the key to the left, and locks when you turn the key to the right. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Oh well, why am I making such a big deal about it, it provides me the security of my place. I should be thankful. Anyhow, I need to get to class. 
__label__label0 Today I woke up to the sun sinning in to the room and it gave me much joy. the warm sun rays lighting up the room starts a day off very nicely. sweetie now that made me feel all warm and fussy in side. I just had to sit back and take it in for a few moments before closing the chat window. she called me sweetie, Wow! I hope she knows that made me feel special. I hope I make her feel special. because she is special to me. PROPNAME what a unique name. It is a lovely name. one with two capital letters. laptops, this is so cool I am typing on a laptop, I wish I could have my own. maybe I could save some money some how. I wonder if my mom will give me some for it. hmmm. must likely not. my sis is doing better. she needs to eat more healthy. this summer was a great summer. God really blessed me. I worked a lot help on the house met one great family and to great friends in it. I got all the classes I wanted to switch in to these fall. so awesome. God is awesome. I am so bless through his love. I pray I make the most of it and continue be focused. I have so much time and yet I always want things faster. I seem to want it now. but time and patients will help me through. Sweetie wow I just can't get over it. I am so lucky to have some like that in my life. just to look at her brings me joy. and those eyes. I love getting lost in those eyes. what if I didn't say anything? will she turn away? will she be embarrassed? I hope not. does she feel the same way? If she does is this the one? or maybe it is another I have not met. I wish I knew. I have to be patient. all good things come in time. I wonder if she knows that I wonder what she is doing sometimes. does she do the same? when can I see her again. when is too soon to talk to her. what is to much? who knows! her smile is so beautiful. no wonder I am so at tracked to her. the smile is the first things I notice in a girl. and my mom likes her too, what are the odds. something must be right. maybe I thinking too far ahead. all I now is I like it. I like PROPNAME and she likes me. That is what I know. I know I want to see more of her but that will have to go slow because school is why I am here in LOCNAME. maybe over Christmas we can see more of each other. 
__label__label0 There are many things that have been bothering me lately. I feel as if I have been betrayed by those that should be absolutely loyal. It is sad that people must always interfere in the things that make you happy. It is as if other people sense when you are content and are trying to steal your happiness out from under you. I have made many new friends that I know will be there for me for many years to come. I feel as if I am part of a sacred family that always supports and protects those that it calls its own. Well, that family has just been defiled by the actions of one. Even though I am not perfect myself, by any means, I always try to do my best when it comes to keeping promises. I am afraid to see what may come of this action. The consequences could be severe indeed if we are found to be guilty of this false accusation. I do not understand what could possess another person to want to place his family in jeopardy just for the sake of conversation. I am deeply saddened by this recent turn of events and I hope and pray that everything will work itself out and that my family will survive and be able to grow into the future. I am prepared to accept the consequences of the actions of my brothers; that is what makes us a family. We have already grown beyond the notion of selfishness and are prepared to assist our family members in any situation, even if it means that we will suffer greatly for actions that were not ours to commit. This new family means the world to me. After leaving my home I felt alone and afraid until I found a group of friends so loyal and so trustworthy that I immediately felt at home again. I will do anything to see that my new family is not harmed or defiled in any way. I believe that it is necessary to have a strong support group to succeed, not only as a student, but as a human being. I am prepared to lay down my selfish tendencies for the good of my family. It is the least I can do. I love my new family as much as my old family. I refuse to see it be destroyed. 
__label__label1 Thoughts are constantly bombarding me since I moved here. It is a whole new world now. Time is a precious commodity that I need to manage more efficiently. I see so many different people here and I have met quite a few people these past weeks. My future is on the line now, but I am so young. So many things are tempting me away from my goals. I must get organized as soon as possible. Girls are everywhere and there are so many cool ones. I never can remember all those names. My fraternity has a bunch of really good guys in it I can not wait until pledgeship is over. Life is at it's best and worst right now. I have never been this emotionally unstable. My mind is like a roller coaster. I guess I have not adjusted to everything yet. Once I do maybe I will be alright. I do not really have a grip on all of my classes. Once again I need to get organized. Now that no one is telling me to do anything I need to work on my self motivation. I find myself thinking a lot about things that went on in high school but I do not miss it much at all. I do miss football. It kept me in shape therefore making me feel good about myself. I think about girls too much of the time. It drives me crazy sometimes. I love Austin. It is such a great city. I love the university's atmosphere. It feels good to be free. I need to stop procrastinating, it kills me. School work constantly haunts me until I finally do it. I am not really depressed or anything. Overall I am doing well. I hope I get TexasOU tickets. I would hate to miss this years game. Last game was pretty fun. 
__label__label1 Well currently I am stressed out. It is as if I have so much to do and not enough time to do it. I get real frustrated and tired yet, things must be done. My academics take up a significant amount of time and then there's my extracurricular activities. I am so used to being involved to the point that I came to college and repeated the same cycle. My grades reflect this. I just want to get at least a 0. 0 and go to a decent medical school. My sorority's members are some of the most elite black women on campus, in the community and in the world. All of my friends want to become members. I am so nice to them which is not the proper protocol for interested people. My line sisters reiterate to me daily that I must learn how to be stern and forceful to them instead of befriending them. At our interests meetings we turn mean. How can I hug them on the behind closed doors and intimidate them at meetings. I don't want them to consider me a hypocrite and I want to maintain that level of friendship. They look to me for knowledge and direction instead of evilness and cruelty. My first mind is saying forget what people are saying those are your friends. My second mind is saying that they don't respect you and they feel as though the have nothing to prove because we are already friends. They'll learn when what's up y'all turns into, salutations and how are you. I have so much on my mind that I believe my mind is going to overload and explode. Must do homework, must practice, must get involved, must go to work are just a few of my daily struggles with my time  
__label__label0 I guess the way I feel right now is overwhelmed. I just came back from a class of 000 students, which is double the number of kids in my whole graduating class. Although there are many students here who are so excited to be away from home and all on their own I wouldn't mind going back home and staying their for a while. I am very pleased with my life at home and this sudden change has left me to start all over. Although I know this is a part of life I feel as thought I am losing some of my childhood friends yet no one is replacing them. At first I told myself that is just how I feel and if those childhood friends felt the same then I might be right but this whole summer all of my high school friends were ready to leave for college. Now that we are all separated we understand how much we depended on each other. I have been here three days and everyday for at least an hour I have talked to my friend back home. I guess what scares me the most is that when you meet someone here you have no idea where they came from, where they have been, or what type of person they are. Back at home we all knew each others families, knew what type of person they where etc. I can truly same that moving to LOCNAME has definitely made me reevaluate myself. Not to be cocky but back at home everyone knew who I was and what type of person I was, but here everyone thinks I am a nobody. I feel as thought I have to impress someone for him or her to approach me where at home others approached me. I guess the comfort of home was my stability and now that I am here I have to build a new foundation to start from. I am very great full that there is one other person from my school here because we are together all the time and it makes this transition just a bit easier. Now that we have started classes I am trying to busy myself with my work, which is, a good thing and then it seem as thought time goes by a lot faster. I think I just have to mental got myself ready for this semester and then I will be fine. I do like challenges and that is why I came to this university but the challenges I expected are not the ones I am having trouble adjusting too. It is completely different aspects of college life that has thrown me off. 
__label__label1 I am residing at Castillian for my freshman year. I have my own personal room, which is more than I can say for others. It is very nicely furnished with all of my personal possessions from home. The entire back wall is a large window with a beautiful view of the hills. All the lights can be seen twinkling, which causes a serene atmosphere and a pleasant way to relax. My parents are paying a small fortune for my to stay here as well as for all of the other things I'd like to do. They try so hard to make me happy, but I'm not. I feel a sense of debt to them to succeed in college. I also believe that this was their full intention. We'll call it a bribe. They spit out money as long as I do well. This shouldn't be a problem for me considering grades have always been important to me, and I myself would like to succeed as best I can. The bribe, however, is the problem. I'm cracking, although that term doesn't quite seem to fit my feelings. Dissolving in a container of sulfur dioxide seems to better fit the description. Everything engulfs you at once and slowly eats you away. Your struck with shock and you can no longer feel the pain. You can always try and get out, but since you are dissolving, everything you aim for slips through your fingertips. I have studied numerous hours to ensure myself the proper background for each of my subjects. I go to every discussion session and can explain anything that has been taught in class or the first chapter of each book. When it actually comes to turning something in, however, minute mistakes always seem to add up. Already after the first day of class, I have messed up terribly on homework. I am incredibly stressed out and seeing the results of this assignment (though it's not for a grade nor does the professor use it for anything) made me more miserable. In fact, it actually brought me to tears. An assignment that means nothing to anyone (except obviously me) brought me to a ranting rage and then tears. I see myself as pathetic because I failed myself and because I can crack so easily. I can't say that my classes are overwhelming, though they take up from 0  0 with a one hour lunch break each day. If I had to guess, I would say that I was unsure of everything. I'm unsure of friends, family, boyfriend, classes, grades, time, money, and so much more. On top of this, I'm left for the first time in my life to attempt at juggling all of these things around at once. I'm sure it will all level out in the end and that I'll eventually get the swing of things. As of now, however, I feel like a mere speck amongst better people who are sure of so many things. I only wish I wasn't born with the disease of being manic depressive (and that my grandmother in LOCNAME hadn't died last week). It only seems to complicate things. Also, as we said in class, stress can bring about depression and visaversa. Perhaps that is playing a slight role in my emotions. All I know is that it seems so much right now. 
__label__label0      Stream of thought. this is interesting because it seems like i've done this many times on my own. keeping a journal of things i'm feeling or things that have been on my mind, but i can never quite finish a thought before another one pops into my mind. i've been at the chi o house for almost 0 hours today, but wait- instead of studying at the chi o house i spent those 0 hours trying to save an apartment for myself and 0 friends next year. that didn't work because you can't forget to speak to your father when it comes to issues of money (whether it's his money or your own). i'm a little frustrated because i haven't been able to get my computer hooked up to the ethernet service at hardin house yet. ok, very frustrated. i'm even using my roommate's computer at the moment. not that that is a bad thing, but hey, maybe i want to use my own computer!  oh well- she's never here anyway. i kind of like it bc she has all of her classes in the morning and mine are pretty much spread out through the entire day, so we don't see each other that much. it keeps us from getting sick of each other, and we still find the other person amusing when we do spend time together. on the other hand, my best friend from high school- i'm about to scream!  i was so hoping that when i came to ut, a school of collosal size, that it might be possible for me to get away from westlake; branch out; make some new friends; have some new experiences. while all this is taking place, i still seem to have this tie to my high school- her name is robin. she hadn't always planned on coming to ut. as a matter of fact, she wanted to go to baylor with our friend PROPNAME (robin is my closest friend, but i kind of wish she had gone to baylor) but one day she just made up her mind and here we are. still   summer and robin   or   robin and summer  . . why can't i just be my own person???  i enjoy having time to myself. don't get me wrong, i am a very outgoing person- i love to meet new people- i even want to dual major in public relations (and photography), but sometimes it's nice to just not have to talk to anyone. to just be alone. this thing with robin has gotten out of hand!  now that she's seen how much fun i had going through rush she wants to rush next year. now that she knows i'm going to do young life leadership she wants to do yl leadership. i drive her to church every morning and then to her house afterwards (it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out of the way. but she's my friend, so i do it). i'm signing up to do texas angels next year, so she's going to sign up to be an angel. and the list goes on. i can understand that yeah she may actually be interested in these things- and i'm so glad she's wanting to be involved in things like young life and lake hills church (which meets at our high school by the way) but i need some air. it's even gotten to the point where i actually feel guilty if i hang out with/make new friends!  that's not right!!!  the thing is i know i need to just talk to her and let her know what i'm thinking (maybe not to the full extent) but she has a right to know how spending so much time together is hurting our friendship more than helping it. i just hate to hurt her feelings. it'll work out. i can't believe i'm writing all these thoughts down for other people to see. i'm assuming other people will read this because it's an assignment, but hey. stream of consciousness eh? :)  i've recently been reading this book called   when God writes your love story   and i wish i could spend more time reading it to get it finished. it's really interesting, although often cheezy, but it talks about God being the center of your life and the center of your relationship with members of the opposite sex. the thing that hits me most strongly is when it talks about how instead of pursuing relationships, we should give this area to God and let Him pick out our partner for us. I've known that God has someone special picked out for me, but i never thought of actually backing off and letting God bring him to me. i know He will, but it's hard to not be looking for that someone. yeah. . still a little rusty on the subject - that's why i should actually FINISH THE BOOK! :)  and that's another thing- i have NOT been keeping up with my quiet times recently!  not just recently. it's been quite some time. i want to but there's just not that constant desire you know?  it's something that i need to be praying about. there are lots of things i need to be praying about, such as continued enthusiasm for my studies at ut. i am so excited about all of my classes!  they are ALL soooo amazingly interesting to me, and i hope i just don't get burnt out on any of them. the only class i'm having a big problem with is my biology class. i'm so interested in the material, but my professor just sucks. she's nice, and i can tell she's interested in and excited about the information, but she just doesn't know how to present it in a way that others might find it interesting as well. i've never fallen asleep in a class until this one!  and yeah. . i haven't made it to that 0am biology discussion lab on fridays. it's not like i go out and party (and i don't ever have hangovers then bc i just plain don't drink at all) but i'm such a night person!  actually i dont' know what the deal is. ever since middle school i haven't gone to bed before midnight and now that's more like 0am.  but no matter what time i go to sleep early or late, i cannot for the life o fme wake up the next morning. it's an impossibility. time is almost up i wish there was more time to write though. oh well.

__label__label1 Wow, my friend is having so much more fun than I am in college. By now I had figured that I would have at least made some new friends, and I have. I mean, ORGNAME in my Theory and piano classes is totally awesome and in the cello studio I am in I have met some awesome people and made some friends like PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME but I vowed that I would not get stuck in the music building all day long and only hang out with music people. Okay, so I'm a music major and of course those are the people that I am mostly going to be hanging out with but music is a very isolated world. When I go to my other classes its like a whole nother world out there. I really did like that song from LOCNAME, and that was a great ORGNAME movie. I haven't seen any of the more recent ones but that's to be expected right? But hey, a vicarious Disney movie is good every now and then. I love Sleeping Beauty. I think almost every girl dreams about a wonderful guy, her one true prince that will come and sweep her off her feet and take her from, well maybe not take her from her world, because I actually like my world right now. No, I'm not happy with everything in it, especially my social life, but that can be fixed. Ack!! I have no idea how I am going to make it to Astronomy on time. I have had more panic attacks in the past two weeks about Astronomy than I have had in the past year. I have to get from the music building to PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I know that its not IMPOSSIBLE because I know like four people who are doing it, but. shit, I'm not a small person, I wasn't a track star in high school or in any sport as a matter of fact so I don't move as fast as others, and when I get stressed I start to have labored breathing, I have very bad allergies. The fastest I have been able to make it is in 00 minutes, and I have to cut it down to 00. What's the worst is that I hate being late anywhere. Its one of my pet peeves so being late to a class is major for me, besides the fact that I, well I actually don't interrupt class I just sit down on the steps in the back of the room and take notes on the lecture. I'm also kind of worried, not really worried but sort of about the class because almost everyone I have talked to has said that it is a hard class. But over the years I have noticed that I actually like the harder classes that challenge me. Maybe these first couple of weeks have been kind of a, I don't know,. I don't know what I'm thinking. I really do go back and delete typos, geez I can't even let a con't go by. oh well. My mom should be coming home soon. She helps out with the orchestra director at my high school, I'm from LOCNAME and am typing from home by the way, not like you really care. hmmmm. . but tonight's back to school night and thats a really big night for elementary, middle, and high schools. I didn't make the symphony last week. I didn't play my best audition so I shouldn't be suprised but I had really wanted to make it, but the University orchestra is playing some really awesome music this semester. We're playing Egmont by PROPNAME, a Mendhelson piano concerto, the Mother Goose Suite by PROPNAME, and Second Essay for Strings by PROPNAME. I played Adagio by PROPNAME in high school, oh, that was an amazing performance. If there were a lever that I could press that would make me feel like I do when I'm playing a truly amazing concert I would press that all the time. I hope that I will have the same feelings in college, its just that High School orchestra was so awesome and amazing with Mr. PROPNAME, he picked music that we could play and that was really good too. I mean come on, Overtures to Candide, the Merry Wives of LOCNAME, LOCNAME, and PROPNAME and PROPNAME just to name a few. And in ORGNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, we played the full, I mean the FULL COMPLETE the Planets by PROPNAME. People would ask me   oh, what movements?   and I would be like ALL OF THEM BABY!!! Oh!! and Scheherezade! that was a. . ahh!!! I can't even express how utterly amazing that concert was. Wow, I love music so much, but Music Theory is a pain in the ass. Not that it's all bad, alot of it is nice, but tedious. I just can't figure out and easy way for me to identify major and minor intervals. I can easinly identify perfect fifths and octaves but most people can. Well, techinically its easier for me because my instrument is tuned in fifths so each of my strings are a fifth apart and octaves, well, those are just the same note. My high school band friends love what they do so much. Its refreshing in a way to see them having the time of their life playing and having fun, doing what they love, and that is my goal too. I'm in music because I have fun doing it, recieve a joy unsurpassed doing it, and give a joy to others also. Hopefully I'm going to go se Le Mis next week. I haven't seen it yet, and I just really really really want to, but the tickets are expensive, heck any tickets are expensive now adays, but when weren't they?  So if my friends don't want the really expensive seats I am going with them. 
__label__label1      I awake. From sleep. I don't know. I walk to the window. Stop short. Who's there? A man calls out, I don't know his name. Because he is my father. Black night, cold rain. Stop. Before I choose I want to know. Stop. Awake. I can't. I don't. Even though you are there. The bird it flies. I stop to catch it's beauty, I have never seen this. I ponder my posture, I slant. You stood, you go to the store for some breakfast. I can't eat, you know that, but you insist. I refuse. We fight we braek we die. All for the love. The window it breaks. It shatters. Understand me, I am right. You don't know, you can't know. You don't understand. I can't seem to think with all the windows breaking. The grass is soft on my brown feet. My brown feet. My clown feet. My hair is dense. I see my reflection. I am cold. Who is that? The only thing I see is my reflection. It knows I'm here. I know I'm late. My hand hurts. I bite it off. It's full of nutrients. The back of my head aches, is it the clown? No it's me, I am your clown. I am your savior. The blue ice hates to see it go. The penguin, the clown, they get together. How am I going to tell my mom. Bloom. Prosper and perish. I die and you prosper. The only thing you am I know it is I can't. Follow the thought. Train your mind. Eat at PROPNAME's. The full of my stomach eats at my liver. My house has the potential for greatness. The stops are all out. Pull me back into the water. I can't drown, I'm invincible, didn't you know? Ask me again. Try not to speak. Move your lips without speaking. Speak your lips without moving. I'm falling asleep and I don't think you can stop me. The game is mine. I have won and you have lost. Ask me agian. I ate your pony if you will play with me. The back of my head hurts again. My reflection is laughing at me. Black laugh, why do you do it? Brown feet,my mud is clean. My belt gets whiplash. A cornea operation. We play the game. Again, again,and again. I lose and lose, I can't help it. Yes i can, but i don't want to. It might hurt. Bow. Curtsey. Do your dance. Make the jester happy. Cornrows, fields of wheat. Ha! I laugh at your jokes. I'm crying. Confused, Understood. Understand. I can't . I missed my chance. The pondwater makes me ill. I'm done. It make me green. I'm green. We are all green. Does that pose a problem? No 'm not ask me again. Bye. Don't go. Don't even think about leaving. You cruel hateful person. Lampshade. Where the hell is my bloody lampshade? I'm sorry, was that yours? What do you think ponyman? The question is yours the answer is mine. Can we switch? I don't think so. Didn't think so. 
__label__label1      Okay, so I am in my dorm room alone. I'm mostly thinking about how great my day was. I haven't had a day this good in a long time. Even though I had to wake up early I was rewarded by my Cotton Bowl tickets which makes me happy, because I never win anything so it's really cool for me that I was the one who drew the best number. Maybe my luck is finally coming in. I hope so. In addition to the tickets I got to see the guy who I am totally in love with twice today which was simply a gift from god because I hadn't seen him in a long time. When I started to pray for him I got to see him on Tuesday, then when I started thinking about him even more, I got to see him twice, and he even spoke to me. I just wonder what he thinks about me. I doubt that he is thinking of me right now, but when he sees me, I wonder what goes through his head. I've never had a guy be truely interested in me before, so I hope that now that I'm in college, my luck will change. Judging from my lucky number with the OU tickets, it looks like my luck is changing,  but I can't say that it was just luck, because my rededicating my life to the Lord contributed to my current happness in a big way. Actually He is the entire reason why I am feeling the happiest I have since I have moved here. I have made good friends and I get to see PROPNAME. I just hope that I get to experience this feeling for a long time. I really am so happy, when I was walking down the street people were looking at me like I was crazy because I had this huge smile on my face. Being a good person and having faith can get you anywhere that you want to be in life, and now that I have accepted that I feel a little more at ease. Just a little though, I still worry about my classes. I just really want to do well. I need to catch up on my readings, which I will do this weekend. I just have to make myself. I also need to get my spiral back from PROPNAME. It really pisses me off that she borrowed my notes, and hasn't given them back yet. That is really rude and inconciderant! It's okay though, becuse now I am thinking about PROPNAME again, so I am happy. I can't believe how happy it makes me just to think about him. I know I seem crazy because I barely even know him, but there is something about the fact that he makes eye contact with me, and that he is the only guy to ever speak to me on this campus. It just says something about him and about the way that he sees me, at least that's what I think. I just really want to fall in love. I look around and see all of these couples, and watch romantic movies, and listen to love songs, I want it so bad, that I can feel it! Something in my gut tells me that PROPNAME is going to be my first real love, and even if it doesn't work out in the end and I get my heart broken, I feel like I'm ready. Ready to experience something. 
__label__label1      Well, this is definetly the first assignment of its kind that I have ever done, I can only hope that i can find enough things to think about for 00 minutes, wait 00 minutes and 00 seconds. That was some math I was hoping to avoid. I wish it wasn't so early, as a matter of fact I shouldnt be awake right now, my next class doesnt start for two hours, nap time, YES! oh wait no thats not right There is still that whole writing thing I'm doing. Come to think about it this is a fairly effective way of making sure that all the students put the same amount of time, and at least a comparable amount of effort in there assignment. For better or for worse. At least the week has begun. In high school thats the last thing I would be thinking early on a monday morning, but it's how I feel now. Upon self reflection though I realize it's not just my insatiable lust for learning that drives me on in the week but rather a combination of that and the fact that I had to work all weekend. Oh well the week will be like a little vacation for me. Looking around the room I see some posters, some course sylabi, some empty cups, textbooks, oh yeah posters. The last one that I got from those irish vendors downstairs, where in LOCNAME did they say they were from? Can't Remember. Anyway the poster was one I had somehow missed the first time around, hard to imagine since its so darn cool. It's a nice photograph of an H bomb, its really the peice of art that allows the Zen of my tiny dorm room to be complete. right. Ok almost half way there. almost. almost. yes. Good. Even though this is a course assignment I feel very idle, a feeling that I don't particularly like. don't get me wrong I like not having anything to do but I have stuff to do, and was actually set to do it this fine morning. I wonder if the tracing of consciousness would be interrupted by catching up in the reading in my philosophy (abortion, everyones favourite topic). Well of course it wouldn't, but I am sure my ability to trace it would be impaired, and we wouldnt want that to happen. The abortion chapter in philosophy has really gotten me thinking (also thinking I need to finish that first chapter). It was something that I had never given much thought to other then what I saw or read in the media, or touched on in political discussions. I had always considered myself largely pro-choice, but being confronted with logical philosophical arguements has led me to rethink my stance and now I have absolutely no idea what to think about the issue. Of course there are an untold number examples of things that are philosophically logical, but practically not practical (I wonder of unpractical is a real word, yeah it must be, damn). Was there something about us not going back and changing what we wrote the first time? If there wasnt there should be. Except maybe with they dozens of typos I am constantly correcting. three seconds left bye. Continue writing? I don't think so. 
__label__label1      My throat hurts really bad these past two days but I kind of like it cause when my voice is scratchy it makes me feel sexy. But the problem with that is two-fold, one- why should i want to feel sexy if i already have a boyfriend? does that mean i want a different one? and two i shouldn't be kissing my boyfriend if my throat is scratchy so it doesn't matter if i feel sexy. that whole situation reminds me of the friends episode when phoebe had a cold and she was a super good singer because the phelgm made her feel sexy, but since i'm not a singer i really don't have any useful outputs for my cold and it just makes me feel gross. what i'm afraid of with all this is that i'm thinking about what to type and then typing it rather than just typing thoughts as they come. hopefully you won't have time to read this though so you won't know about my concern of how   honest   my stream of consciousness is really being. sometimes i want to be an artist because i think that it's really incredible to be able to depict what you think something resembles. but i could never do that because my hands don't have the talent that my mind does- so i think of great things but then i'm never able to really express them, that's probably why most artists are insane because they can't perfectly match their impression of something with their depiction of something. right now our neighbor guy is playing classic rock really loud and it's kind of distracting me. i would go tell him to turn it down but i don't want to interrupt my stream, and also i  think he's creepy because he touches my stomach a lot and he gives me these really intense stares and i'm like   whoa?!   but another creepy thing happened today, my ex-boyfriends mom sent me this clipping of him in the paper and was like    just thought you might want to see this clipping about anthony in the navy. e-mail me to keep up and good luck with classes!   weird. one, i only met the lady like twice, i didn't even get formally introduced to her. two, how did she get my address?? and three, lady your son and i broke up. let's move on with our lives, shall we? there's something about the taste of sick in your mouth. a sore throat or something, but when i coughed jsut now it reminded me of halloween. strange. but that's probably got something to do with all this crazy stuff in the brain that's going on. man it just boggles me. my roommate is in the shower and i just heard this crash of bottles and she laughed. it reminds me of something i do everyday. i just laughed, she's a really great roommate. just like i have a great family and a great boyfriend. if i make the crew team i think my life will be perfect, even though i know i shouldn't depend it on that. it just seems like a dream. after being depressed for so long it's really nice to be alone and realize that i'm happy. i just have a ton of stuff to be thankful for. sometimes i think about the things i would change about myself and i would definately make myself more grateful, and i would be more prude about kissing. i think kissing is really trivialized and it makes me sad. sometimes i want my life to be like a movie and have incredible kisses that you can just hear the music start up with. slow ones that really communicate something. ones where you're not thinking about how the guy's tongue feels or if he has good breath but all you can think about is how good he makes you feel and how much you like or love him. i think the reason why i used to be depressed was because i wanted everything to be perfect like a movie and slowly i started feeling like my life just didn't stack up. but the truth is is that in the grand scheme of things it's like DAMN! i've not only got two legs, two arms, and 00 fingers, but on top of that i also have the great roommate, great family, and great boyfriend, great friends, a great mind, and not too much sadness. i think people always dramatize things because they don't know what they're looking for in life but they figure that people will suddenly pay attention to them and they'll figure it out. almost anyone wants attention- that's why people try to committ suicide, why people cry, it's the explanation for so much. how weird is that that okasy i lost that thought but i'm still typing. i'm a die hard stream of consiouicness writer, i breeeze buy typos, not a problem for me. but the classic rock is. i'm ready to destroy his speakers i think. music should say stuff- not just be a bunch of noise. music should be stream of consciousness because it would reveal truths in life. isn't that what it's all about? the ttruth? now i sound like my ex-boyfriend who was obsessed with plato and searching for the truth. he invented this kissing thing called the euclidian vacuum. it was way creepy. i want to talk about my cat willy cause i miss him. i miss feeling his little cat body sleeping on me and purring. college students are depressed cause dorms won't let you have pets- that's really why. that and the whole loneliness of sin thing. when it comes to sinning, you try to find other people who have done the same thing as you, but it just ends up making you feel worse knowing that there are other people in the world that mess up like you. i want to have some famous last line here but i think i'll settle for i just looked at the clock and i don't have time! MARSHMALLOWS!  
__label__label1      Today is September 00, 0000. Exactly one year since the attack on the twin towers, the attack on our country occured. Today is a day of sorrow, of mourning, but also a day of pride. As I watched the news today and say story after story of all the people who were killed and of the people who risked their lives to save others I was deeply touched. Atfirst I was sad as I thought about all those who were killed and their families that they left behind. But know, as I have watched as our country has come together, I am extremely proud. I remember at this time last year, American pride was so awesome all across the country. People had their flags out and people just helped each other. People began to think more in terms of our country rather than my country. Today the same thing is happening and many people are uniting to show their pride in their nation, and to remember those that were lost and those that fought for them and lost their lives in the process. I can remember exactly where I was when the second plane crashed. I was in my creative writing class and a girl, PROPNAME PROPNAME, walked in late talking about how a plane had crashed into one of the twin towers. My teacher turned on the TV and we all watched in awe as it was burning there and people were dyeing. And then out of nowhere the second plane crashed right before our very eyes. We were in shock and I remember I got the chills. I think that I will forever that moment and that feeling inside of me. I remember watching the news as people cried through the streets holding pictures of their loved ones, looking desperately for them all over, just hoping that they weren't in the crash. Today, is a day of remembering though and also a day of forgetting, trying to go on with our daily lives and overcome the terrorism that has overtaken our country.       College life besides the horrific event that we are remembering is going well. I joined TriDelt and am in the greek system. At first I didn't really want to be a tridelt and was disappointed, but now I am really happy. Our pledge class is so amazing and a lot of the girls in it are really cool. We participated in this field day event last saturday and it was really fun. I got to know a lot of the girls better and we bonded. We also went on our pledge retreat that night as well which was a good experience. We were all really exausted but we tried to socialize and get to know each other. Last night I went to this praise and worship thing called Escape. It was at this guys house and there were so many people there. Usually there aren't that many people who go, but last night so many came that we had to go in the backyard. It was awesome even our in the heat. It was so reassuring to see that there are other Christians on this campus and I felt very close to the lord there in that backyard with complete strangers and the dog barking in the background. It is so easy to lose focus here on theis campus, and last night was so helpful for me to really  remember what is really important in this life. I sometimes feel myself getting lost in school and in sorority and greek life, that I'm like I just don't have enough time for my quit times. The fact of the matter is, He should be my number one prioroty, and l;ately he hasn't been. I am working on it though, and we just have to do the best we can. But, I am really excited to be here more and more each and every day. I am meeting so many new people and having so much fun with the old friends that I came here with. We just do th 
__label__label0      well i guess the first thing or the thing that i am sort of forcing myself to now think about is what i was thinking about before. and that would be how much i miss my best friend. i was eating at ORGNAME's and i was really hungry because i hadnt eaten anything all day and it was already 0 by then. so i ate a jr. cheese burger, medium fries, and some orange juice. then i went bak and got a salad, frosty, and some water. but i dint really know anyone there because the two friends i came with went to a HOSA meeting so i was by myself for a while so i started thinking. and my thoughts were many but they sort of led back to my best friend PROPNAME at ORGNAME ORGNAME. i don't really know exactly what i was thinking or what i am thinking but i know it was something along the lines of i just really wish i could spend some time with her. i guess i'll get bak to her later when i think of more. my cell phone just rang so i guess that interrupted my train of thought. and iM guessing its most probably Amit because it said   unknown   for the caller ID which most prob. means that its him because his phone is the only one that does that. Also i am really use to pushing   Ctrl S   and i can't really do that here because i am not  writing a word document - i am glad i have developed this habit because it ensures that 00% of the work i have done is saved every few minutes because i really hate having to redo work. now i guess i was just thinking of the clock. i was sort of seeing how fast it would go - like i am sort of surprised that it is already 0 minutes. i thought because of what PROPNAME said that it would take quite a bit of time but time seems to be going by fast enough. my eyes are burning i think because of my contacts because i have gotten enough sleep since i sort of woke up at 0 o' clock today. Once again. i guess my mind - - she just called and it made me feel a lot better because i just told her that she was going to live a thousand years since i was thinking about her. and she was like   awwww I Love You   in the cutest little voice and hten i told her i had to finish this and i also have like no daytime minutes due to a family plan. and now the dorm phone rang and PROPNAME called. i guess we don't have too much peace and quiet in this dorm. lol. but ya it was really cool that she called. and she is stored on my cell phone as 'princess' so its really cool seeing that pop up on my phone!  Well besides i guess really wanting to see and hug her i don't know much else that i am thinking about currently. i guess maybe finding out how much a Greyhound ticket to ORGNAME costs since i would love to go there. Well i guess i also need to figure out what i need to do for the remainder of the day such as finish my MIS homework, chek the emails from ORGNAME, check out the Sprint family plans so i can see how to get more daytime minutes, read some Eco, go over Eco notes, read some Philosophy, and the Philosophy book, read the beginning of the Psychology book, and finish Chapter 0 of MIS, and finish reading Developing You Into Me of Ba000. wow i guess i have quite a bit of reading to catch up on. so maybe i should take care of that for the remainder of the day rather than wake up at 0 o' clock. i really need to wake up earlier and get my homework done. it would be really beneficial to me if i started doing that. Besides all that, PROPNAME, my roommate, also suggested a movie at 0 playing for free at the Union so i may look into that. besides all of that i think i need to use the restroom after i am done with this and i don't really know why i just wrote that down besides the fact that it says write everything you are thinking about and so i was thinking about that so i thought id write it down - just like i was thinking about writing about thinking about going to the bathroom - so i did write it. now my mind is just free i guess. in regards to tom. which is Friday and now the phone just rang and now 00 minutes is over but i was just thinking in regards to tomorrow and the rest of the weekend what i am going to do - whether im going to go home or just stay here but i guess i'll think more about that later 
__label__label1      I'm tired but i want to go to sleep. im listening to music that i really like its new but i like it i like country and this isnt country music does something to me i can't explain it it gives me a feeling i can't decide what to do this weekend i really like to drink sweet tea in a nalgene i found it camp i like it there this weekend i can go camping but i don't know if i should go she talks to angels i want to stay in austin and hang out with some friends and i don't want to leave but i think i should go my roommates are gone eating they like to do fraternity stuff im not in a fraternity im not really the type for a frat but i think it would be good for me but i don't agree with some of the stuff that they do i can't really do a fraternity thats how it is im excited about next week i really like friends i like to spend time with people especially people i am close to i really like to just hang out with the guys i got so much sleep the other day and it was great  im not tired today and i only slept four hours i don't want to do homework i fear growing up and going to work every day all i want to do is play golf and have a good time listen to music and not worry about responsibility but i don't think that can happen its not real i wish it could happen but it can't but life would be very boring if i did that so in a way i guess its good that i can't do that i like listening to really random music music that no one listens to i try to get people to get to listen to the music i listen to but they don't like it it frustrates me because i think i listen to good music a lot of the people are hypocrites they talk about how christian they are but they are not its almost a lie but who am i to judge i am wrong for that i don't like to eat the food it towers but i have to because i don't have enough money i wish i did though i really like to eat good food that is one of the only nice things that i like my shorts came in today and they were wrong i exchanged them it frustrated me i really want to play golf i havent played in a while and i want to play i want to get good really good i want to go back to camp it is fun there that is where many of my friends are from my room is messy and i need to clean it up but im just too lazy what am i going to do about this weekend i need to call austin i need to figure out who i am going to hang out with in college i need to find my group of friends i think that i have my group but i don't know if it is right for me i like this song it does something for me something intangible something awesome i can't explain it but it rules my high school friends did frats but i am the only one who didnt i wonder what that means i guess that i am different i know why but i  wonder if they do they don't seem to understand my ways i different and i wish everyone would understand it but i don't know what to do i wish everyone could just figure it out we are all the same and different i don't like my schedule it sucks straight up i hate the smell of towers but i love sweet tea and golf making tea is awesome it gives me something to do and i like making it for other people i would like others to think that i am a good guy i don't know if that is good or bad i think i should be nice just for being nice but i want people to think that i am a nice guy i can't help it its just the way that i am and i guess that we all are I sometimes think that i like movie soundtracks they are good i like sweet tea its good my roommate doesnt like my music i like to play guitar its good ill brave  your heart swiss watch bagpipes things like that nalgene bottle music rocks i need a new car  but i don't know if i will get one whistling to music a texas hat and abercrombie shirt a chief perhaps my roommant tank he is gay according to my roommate i overuse that word chief but its a good word my roommate is acting like a chief he calls me a chief for calling people chiefs bob dylan rules but  myy roommate is a chief for not liking him i want to play guitar but it is out of tune 
__label__label0    i hope that i can finish my genetics homework by the middle of this week. and i hope that i can somehow get in touch with my genetics teacher and TA. that's really important to me. i also wish that there was something like key club i could join. so that i could go do some community service. preferably with children. i love kids. they're so cute. today i saw some 0 and 0 year olds playing in the playground outside of church. they were so incredibley cute. ben knew right away that i wanted to take them home. whenever i say that, i'm not actually SERIOUS. i just meant that i wish i had some kids, even though i'm only 00 and i plan on staying in school for at LEAST another 0 years. plus the 0 years of residency after medical school. i hope i do well on my mcats. i should probably sign up for that class at the princeton review. either that or i need to start taking time out in my day to practice in my mcat book. and i'm almost positive that i'm going to make it into medical school. there's almost no doubt in my mind. although there is a little, because of some of the statistics that people have been telling me. something about how only 000 people from UT make it into medical school a year. i wonder if it matters that i'm not using hardly any proper grammer or punctuation marks. i almost forgot how to spell punctuation. i used to be a really good speller. and my vocabulary used to FANTASTIC. seriously. it's gone down though, because i just don't read as much. i wish i did. i wish i've read alot of books that daniel has, then we'd have more in common. he's so much like PROPNAME's daniel that it's freaky. they look alike, talk alike, and they even act alike! alike. same. my asian american studies teacher says that those words don't mean the same. i just used that word to describe itself. i'm pretty sure that that's not right, but i guess there's nothing i can do about it. janet's been gone for an hour now. it's alway so lonely without her in the room, but i don't mind it so much. that way, i can actually get some work done. not that i don't get anything done when i'm with her, but obviously she'd be a distraction. and since i get distracted so easily, the less people to talk to, the better. am i supposed to just stop typing at exactly 00 minutes? or will the screen change for me? and what's the point of this anyways? i wasn't in the first class, so i don't have any clue what this is for or if it's a grade. and now i'm listening to some weird music that i downloaded. i guess it really isn't weird, i've just never heard it before. it's kind of like rap. or a mix of some sort. interesting. it keeps repeating   i'm a freak,   it's a little annoying. hopefully the words will change. if they don't in. 00 seconds. i'll change the song myself. oh what do you know, now it's adding like 0 more words or something. hahaha. does it count that i typed myself laughing? does that even make sense? oh goodness, i'm changing this song. it's getting to me. ORGNAME. as soon as i finished typing that, the song ended. that was pretty funny. wow, i've already been typing for 00 minutes. i guess i shouldn't be surprised, i don't ever have a problem just rambling on. my back hurts from hunching over, so now i'm sitting up really straight. i like the rain, except that i don't like the humidity. i just thought of that because i looked out the window and it's getting dark. well, it should be getting dark anyways, because it's almost 0. speaking of the time, why hasn't andy called me? he said he'd call me when he went to go eat dinner today. he always does that. i miss hanging out with andy and ben so much. they're always doing their own thing now, and i guess that's a sign that i need to go out and make my own new friends. but i just like hanging out with them, you know? and i like their friends. especially daniel. i'm always wondering what he's thinking; that boy is so quiet. i wish i knew what he thought of me. i really really wish that andy and ben were more. what's the word? protective? of me. i'd really like it if they called me to do things with them, or just to hang out with them when they're not doing anything. that would make me so happy. i haven't seen thi tran in a week. i wonder what she's up to? i should have called her, but i don't know why i didn't. i had a headache like 00 minutes ago, but after all this random writing and stuff, i've almost forgotten about it. i want to watch some disney movies. i haven't seen one of those in a LONG time, and they're all so great. i saw part of harry potter yesterday. i love that movie. i talked to daniel though, and he said that he likes the book better than the movie. which i guess is true. book to movie translations are never good. my phone just rang. some lady wanted to know if i had any junior girls and senior boys in my family or something. i have no idea what for. something about research. that was strange. tonight i'm going grocery shopping with janet and steven. she really likes steven. and he really likes her; i've been telling her that all week. it seems that me and janet are really going to get along. i hope so. i love her so much; she's so much fun. oh yeah, so about the book to movie translations. i HATED the count of monte crist movie. the new one that is, i've never seen the old one. i mean, the book is my most favorite in the world, and in the movie they had to go screw around with things. and they left out alot of GREAT parts too. it made me so sad that i cried. priscilla and stephanie and josh thought i was funny when that happened. ben and andy were watching black hawk down when we were in the other theater. it's funny how i remember little things like that, but it takes a bit more for me to remember the things that i need to. for example: things i need to do, what to study, things i've studied. and my 00 minutes are almost up. there's 00 seconds or so left. so i suppose that this is the end of my writing assignment. i hope this is sufficient. or i'm going to feel silly. oh well. no time to change it now. BYE! 
__label__label1      So right now I'm trying to hold myself together. I have so much on my mind that its actually a relief to do this assignment even though its holding my back from a deadline. I recently tryed out for LOCNAME Sirits and shockingly I made the first cut. Wow, out of 000 girls I was one of the eighty to be chosen. THe bad news is that I have to do another   creative   project which equals time and money, two things that are in low supply right now. I hate money. People always say,   money can't by you happiness    but I beg to differ. If you have money then you don't have to worry about finding a place you can afford that isnt 00 miles away from campus, or where you're next meal is comming from. It really is the little things for me though. I would like that extra size ice-cream. or another UT t-shirt. However, Mr. PROPNAME steps in {A good friend of my dads} and prevents me from enjoying the extra   perks   of life. I'm sure I'll look back some day and laugh or maybe this is just one of those challenges in a certain stage of our lives life. Maybe if all the college kids were well off it would disrupt the order of the world. Ramen Noddeles would go out of bussines. ORGNAME ORGNAME would close down. And sadly second hand stores would be no more. Wow i really need to finish my project! Its due in a couple of min. I feel like I'm allways rushing around. My life is one big traffic jam. How is this? maybe I take on too much. But other people take on just as much if not more and they seem in control. I wonder if people think I'm in control? Ha that would be the greatest prank of the decade! OK is ths almost over cause i really got to go. . yes almost.   
__label__label0 Today I got a new washer and dryer. I know this is kind of corny to write about, but I am so excited. I won't have to use the laundry room for the apartment complex anymore, because now ì have my own washer and dryer. It cost one dollar to wash and one dollar to dry, in the wash room. My clothes didn't event come out dry. I was so pissed. I am very very thankful for my parents. I would not have this BRANDNEW washer and dryer if it were not for them. God has truly blessed us as a family. My family is a strong, close family. They are always there for me and my sisters no matter what happens. Right now my nieces and nephew ar living with my mom and dad. My sisters are in the ORGNAME,so their children stay with my parents. My mom loves it, but I know it is very hard on her. It is hard on me when I go home to visit. I never get any rest. I am always up around 0:00 in the morning. Someone is always crying at one time or another. Especially PROPNAME, he cries around three in the morning when everyone is asleep. I love going home, but man I get so happy when it is time for me to com back to LOCNAME. This typing thing is going by pretty slow. I swear I have been on here for ten minutes already. I don't even know what else to type about. I could type about my ex-fiance, that would take more than twenty minutes. I am still paying for my foolishness behind him. We were together for a long time, then he proposed. yeah, that same old traditional, only the right way to go kind of things. Anyway, we were together for a long time, about 0 yrs. He proposed in front of my whole family on Dec. 00, which happened to be the day my family celebrated Christmas that yeat. I cried, I said yes . Then all of the drama started, he wanted ot hang out with his friends all of the time , and I just got tired of all of the foolishness. I guess he got tired of all of it too. SO, he broke up with me. I cired for a little while, but my mom helped me out a lot. She told me,   Every woman has her heart broken at least one time, and baby this is your time  . I didn't want to believe it but it was true. I faced the facts, picked up my heart and moved on. It's not time yet!!!!!!!!!!!!! PROPNAME the insanity. I guess I will type really slow so time will go by really fast. I never knew twenty minutes would take this long. Time flys by when you're having fun. I guess this is not one of those times. I'm almost there though. I wonder what everyone else wrote about. You know, I feel like I'm talking to myself or some kind of imaginary friend. This seems so funny. Well I guess I'll take these last few minutes to say my goodbyes. I'm just playing, wasn't that funny. No, I didn't think so either. It's only 0:00, I thought it was eleven o'clock. I did that eleven o'clock to waste time. TWO MORE MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's so delightful. I guess my fingers needed the workout. Poor fingers. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm what to  do, what to do . 00, 0, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,          
__label__label1      Right now I am sitting in my room. my TV ison and I'm actually feeling a bit nervous about this incoming school year. I have never been away from home and i have never been on a university campus that had as many people as UT does. Right now I'm here in my dorm room, it kind ORGNAME smells like B. O. , but I think that's because we prolly haven't cleaned up ORGNAME mess that my room-mate and I have made. The TV is on right now and it's kind of distracting but I'm not going to say anythign because I would consider that rude. Is it bad that I put other peoples concerns and feelings ahead of mine. Dosen't that make me a less ambitious person?to tell yout he truth I really don't care what others think about me. All i care about is what I think of myself, and whether I'm happy with myself or not. At this point I'm happy that i actually got out of my home town. I miss it though. I really don't think that I was ready to go, maybe in another year or so. Is it bad that I don't like school?I know that it's only going to   benefit my future   and get em a six figure income with a house, three kids, two cars, a cat and be able to spend money and not worry about it. it sounds pretty sweet doesn't it. People don't really consider all the work that has to go into it but that's only to be expected. It does not cost anything to dream. I'm sure that it's all worth it though. having completed something that has put you farther ahea in life then the next guy. I'm sure that there will be plenty of oppotunities to make really good money with a degree, or two for that matter. I think that i'm really just nervous about living up to my own expectations. I set really high standards for myself and if they are not met then I have a total break down. I feel as though I am a failure and I probably will not amount to anything. If you can't tell i don't have that great of a self-esteem. I'm sure that by now you can tell that. I'm very intimidated by stadium classrooms. I'm very much more comfortable with a 00:0 ratio classes. I'm only hoping to pass all my classes with the very least a   B   I would say   A   but that goes back to my really high standards. Instead of being dissappointed I would rather achieve something that I know that I can probably complete. I think that this kind of puts me in a comfort zone because then i will never find out what my full potential might be. I will always wonder if I was ever able to fufill that   A   that i wasnt but never really went for. Does this make me a bad person? I think not. I'm really considering going to a university back home. I'm here in the college of Fine Arts in the Dance department. What can you really do with a ORGNAME in Dance? I'm sorry but you can only dance for so long, and what happens if you have an injury? There goes your career and you have nothing to fall back on. I think that it's rediculous that you can't minor in dance. I'm very dissappointed in the dance department here. i actually thought that it would be better than it came out to be. I understand that UT isn't a specialized conservatory in the Arts, but if you are going to offer a major in Dance, at least offer an emphasis or a concentration. I am really considering majoring in Psychology with a minor in Dance. The university back home, ORGNAME of the ORGNAME ORGNAME, offers a minor in dance and a major in Psychology which sounds like the perfect program. I was also thinking about Mass Media. I was thinking about being a talent agent. I need to do something that i can see myself doing for the rest of my life. I'm not sure what that is right now. 
__label__label0 well it's 00 min. into my writing and somehow i erased everything that i had. sorry. anyhow where was i.  I wonder if i should stop hanging around with sisters this semester. That would be really hard I don't think i could do it. I need to be around them. I wonder who i like the most right now. Is it abby? PROPNAME? still caroline?  I wonder if abby would ever hang out with me like one on one. I'm pretty sure yobel would, but she's so young. It doesn't matter to me really but to other people it's such a big deal. I wish all that stuff i had written hadn't of disappeared. what did i do to make that happen?  now the reader's going to think i was goofing off while i should've been writing and made the whole disappearing thing up. i wonder if it'll let me go on for more that 00 minutes. why would it have a fishish button if you were supposed to write for the entire 00 minutes. do some people write shorter. I want to find out but i don't want to push the button cause i may not be able to go back. I wish i had't burned my tongue yesterday. I hate it when i burn my tongue. I wonder where yobel is. I'm starting to get if for her i'm afraid. And when i get it i get it bad. can't i just go one semester without liking somebody?  time's almost up. well i guess i'll contunue writing a little longer since my first part got erased. how did yobel's legs get so muscular. They're awesome. I like the way they make her walk. I wonder if i should've sat by her on the bus today. We could've talked for twice as long. I'm glad i waited for her afer i got off the bus. It probably hinted to her that i like her though. nobody else knows that. should i keep it that way. can i keep it that way?  i hope so. It was horrible last semester with caroline. everybody knew. I hate that. i got to keep this one in my head. in my heart. Maybe i can teach her volleyball and she could teach me soccer. she seemed pretty impressed when i told her about my volleyball class. I wonder if she likes me. Maybe she thinks i'm too old. I don't look old though. I bet peter hogan looks older than me, and he's just a year older than yobel. If anything happens that wouldn't be too much of a problem. I wonder hwere peter hongan is now. why did he disappenar after he got his breakfast?  well if i'm not going bowling i guess i can spend money on breakfast. I wonder who will be there in the cba . i wonder if yobel is there right now. i guess i swing by and see. I'm sure i'll see somebody there anyhow 
__label__label1      What I felt for last few weeks was depression as I do today. I have been depressed for several reasons such as adopting to the new environment, meeting new people, and keeping up with all the works that I have never done before. This writing assignment is another thing that makes my feeling depressed. My hands are getting sweat, I feel my face burning, and I can even hear my heart beating so loud. Since the time I started to write anything, I always had fear of writing. Actually I am not a good writer and writing makes my feeling very nervous. More than that, my boy friend is about to call me, and I really hope he would not call me until I finish writing this since I only got 00 minutes to do this. Well, even though he calls me, I don't think I will answer it, then call him back later and yell at him. Also I hope grammer and spelling mistakes won't be counted off from this type of writing. Now iI just touched my nose, and smelled cigarette on my finger. I am storongly thinking that I should quit smoking, which I am trying very hard to do. But this moment, I feel like to smoke really bad. Smoking always help me getting calm down. I feel totally lonely here, people are talking to each other, and they look like they all got their own friends. I am totally alone here, writing this paper. I felt lonely since I started to live alone. This is my first time to live myself, and whenever I try to sleep at night, I just feel some fear. I do not know what exactly that is. I just can't briefly breath, and now I feel same thing as writing this paper. I think my fear about dark and death started since I was in 0th grade. Because of my mom and dad who both had jobs, I had to live with my grandmother. Worse than that, I read a book called   I didn't belive recarnation  -well, actually something like that, when I was in 0th grade. That influenced me a lot in bad ways- fearing dark, and death. I am not actually scared of death at this moment since it is bright outside, but I feel similar fear right now. Now my hands are getting worse, and my fingers are sliding on the keyboard, and I really don't like that since this computer already has bad keyboard which is very hard to type on. I was not sure if I wanted to do this writing today since there were so many bad thing happened today- internet at home started not to work, I got a bad computer in communication building, and just this moment I pushed wrong key and keyboard did not work for last few minutes. I think I get very easily distractive since I am keep looking at someone else's sreen to see what he is doing on the internet. Anyways, it is such great experience that made me almost cry, and now I will count off ten until this page shuts down. Is it usual that I don't remember what I listed up there? Well. its been over 00 minutes, but it says I can keep writing. But I am not going to write any more since it is promise between the direction and me. Hope I am a few of people who are honest. 
__label__label1      yeah so i really don't want to be doing this but oh well. i really actually enjoy the psych class though sometimes i wonder how exactly anyone can figure out what a person is thinking. who came up with those experiments in the first place. im so relaxed right now cause i just got back from having a one hour massage. it was kind of weird at first cause i had never had one before but after like 00 min i was asleep. i so needed a massage, and i always seem to be tired even though i feel i get plenty of sleep. i don't think im typing as fast as i should be because there is this little voice saying you mispelled a word, go back and correct it. i guess that means i don't know if im actually completing the exercise correctly. but he never did list whether things had to be grammarically correct. i feel that im like this never ending jutebox that won't stop talking. right now im typing like those really annoying people that you never want to listen to that you are just like SHUT UP. haha. yeah so i have alot of stuff on my mind lately. i would like to actually call this my vent session because i have all this stuff in my mind thats just really been bugging me and i can't tell anyone because my best friend is so far up my roommates butt, because they are boyfriend and girlfriend, that i can say how i REALLY feel. my roommate can be such a jerk sometimes. and he does the stupidest things that just totally piss me off. like this one time i got back home from houston and he was like its your turn to buy the groceries. but i was the one that bought eighty-eight dollars in food when he only bought thirty. he was like well I've finally caught up with you now and I've spent one hundred and eighty. and im thinking, well jeez im sorry to put you out but i barely ever eat. i swear he eats like there is no tomorrow and i think that I've narrowed it down to how many times he eats a day. like 0!  it just really pisses me off. and he tells ME how i do nothing. im not the one who has tuesday and thursday off. not only that he sleep all freakin day. hes SO LAZY. i just want to say to him, hey im not the one that spends 00 freakin dollars on the lunch meat you pick out and watch them cut. come on and give me a freakin break. on top of the whole grocery issue, my parents have ME on a strict budget and so i can't spend all that much money. he goes out and buys a three hundred dollar tv because he feels like it. what can you say to that. his dad is working his butt off to pay for all the crap my roommate uses. dang the phone is ringing now and i can't concentrate anymore on what i was saying. anyways. yeah so i just want to be like, why don't you get off your lazy, pardon my language ass, and get a freakin job and stop mooching off of all your daddy's money. its not like his parents are rich either, he just thinks he is. on top of that he is sooo vain. everything on him and around him is so perfect. sometimes i wonder if hes a girl at heart or if he just LOVES looking at himself in the mirror.   god if only i was brave enough to tell him how i really feel. it wouldn't be so bad except for the fact is that its my freaking apartment too and my best friend, though i love her to death, is living with us. its like nightmare that never ends. you know those feelings when you are a third wheel and you just want to get the hell out? can you imagine it like 00/0. its horrible. it just makes you want to crawl in a hole and die. come on i pay for the freaking apartment the least she could do is STOP mooching off of us and possibly go home?  jeez.  on the topic of being a third wheel. i have this issue with two guys. im seeing this guy in houston that i like alot since my last boyfriend who totally broke my heart. lets say the guy im dating now is bob, and my ex is paul. so bob is like so sweet and hes alot older than me and i miss him a whole lot. at the same time paul who NOW goes to school with me, the reason we broke up is a long story, well we are becoming good friends. i never expected the thing with bob to actually happen over the summer and so now i have this like guy who i don't know exactly what we are but is considered a long distance relationship. bob has been nothing but sweet to me and i love him,  actually wait another thing he doesn't want me to tell him that i love him either. i mean maybe i do and maybe i don't. so yeah, me and paul have become best friends again after our whole breakup and his cheating on me with the girlfriend he had, but then calling me to tell me two weeks before school started back up that he had broken up with her. come on now, i haven't talken to paul in like forever then he calls me to tell me hes broken up with his girl friend. strange yes. but I've told myself that I've gotten over with him after being his girlfriend for two and half years. thats a long time to spend on one person. so yeah he came over yesterday to hang out with me while i was waiting for the time warner roadrunner dudes to come over and me and paul started watching a movie together. he started getting closer and closer to me but i was like woah arent we just friends. so i get up to get a drink, come back to my room and lay down on my bed. paul sits on my back and starts giving me a   friendly back massage   and all the while i was thinking that i really miss him and that i wouldn't mind getting back together with him. at this time bob hadn't called me since sunday night and i was getting really worried. so i started relaxing and having a good ole time with paul. later that night bob calls and hes like hey sweetie, i miss you and im sorry i haven't called you but I've been really busy and i tried sending you and email but it didn't work. yeah so now im caught in this situation that i can't seem to get out of or fig ure out. should i go after my ex that is here in austin. or should i go after bob whose been nothing but sweet to me, but is back home. i don't know what  i should do. and on top of all of this im sorta lonely, and i have alot of school work to take care and if i WANT a social life that not only that i can't seem to find ,and i have to work. i think that im slowly going insaine and this is too much things to think about for a person at my age. woah so yeah im going to stop now cause I've actually typed past the twenty min but i kind of feel better though 
__label__label1      Well i just got back from LOCNAME, where i live. It was weird going back. Kind of like this isn't my home anymore, even though LOCNAME isn't my home. It's just my temporary home. It's weird though seeing my parents, knowing that I won't see them for a long time. It was good to see them again. I hope I'm not going to make myself too crazy up here with school. School is my number one priority. I want to have a good life after this, i don't want to end up in a job i hate. Hopefully i figure out what i want to do with my life. I don't know if i want to teach, or work for a record label, or write for the rest of my life, or do something with crime scene investigation. I think being a criminal psycologist would be a lot of fun. I bet it would never get boring! I just hope I'm not getting in over my head with this class. I've always been interested in psycology, and how people act and why, and what causes it, but I'm afraid i will be over my head. Hopefully not. It seems like it will be very intersting despite the hard work I know will come. It's very strange being in a class that's so huge! I'm used to being in classes with no more than 00 people. I guess all freshmen are though. I still feel like I'm kind of out of place sometimes here. Luckily I've been making friends with the people on my floor. Everyone here seems really cool. There are a few girls down the hall that are soo cool! I could see myself being friends with them for awhile. I hope so at least! Everyone here seems very nice and friendly. (At least the people on my half of the floor does. ) The other side seems very anti-social. We all have our doors open on this side of the floor, but I never see any of their doors open down the hall. It's strange, but i don't really miss many of my friends. I don't think this makes me a bad friend, I just think i was ready to separate from them. Some of them at least. But I thought I was going to miss some of them SO much, but in reality, I don't miss many of them. Especially some of the friends I was supposedly   best friends   with. I sometimes wonder if I'm missed. I wonder if I was as good of a friend as i thought I was. I don't know. One of the girls down the floor just got back frlom out of town. She's one of the girls i think i could be good friends with for awhile after this year. She's a lot like me! Surprisingly. It's hard to find people who don't really drink, and have more fun just hanging out, and going bowling, or going to the movies, instead of going to a frat, or a big party. It's cool though that she's like that. It's nice to find someone who likes the same things you do, especially when they're so uncommon around college kids! I've only been back for a few hours, and I don't miss my parents! I thought i would miss them more. I think this means I'm grown up now! haha, grown up. That's weird to think. I don't feel like I'm grown up. I still feel like the same old nerd from LOCNAME. haha. I finally threw my flowers out that were sent to me, and washed the vase. They were starting to smell a little funky. PROPNAME, my roommate just got back from the grocery store. I hope she bought good food! hehe. The food here is pretty good though, surprisingly. Not like home, but good enough to eat. Some of it is really good though, you just have to pick the right things is all. I could talk about food all day! haha. I can't wait to watch Sex and the City tonight with some girs from the floor. Since we don't get ORGNAME here my mom taped the last 0 episodes and I brought them abck for all of us poor girls with no ORGNAME! Hopefully PROPNAME gets back from dropping her boyfriend off at SW in not too long. I have an early class in the morning, and i don't want to miss it. Especially since it's a class of 00 people, it would be hard to go unnoticed. I think it will be a fun class. It's Jazz and Literature. I love listening to jazz, but there's going to be a lot of writing and reading. Hopefully the writing will be fun. I love creative writing and writing like this, just writing whatever comes to my head. But essays and stuff aren't that fun. I don't know anyone who likes writing them though. My rhetoric class is going to be a lot of that not fun writing though. Yuck. Oh well it's a class I have to take. Hopefully I'll enjoy it though. Otherwise it's going to be hard to drag myself to the class every Tuesday and Thursday. 
__label__label0      I wish travis would stop switching channels on the TV. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at LOCNAME. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. So in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. For a 00 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 00 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature?  i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like   kendra im gay   and i'll be like   i know its about time    and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of ORGNAME. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his   alone time   with mom. but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he's in high school too. i think its just too funny. now mom's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she won't get bored. i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i've been locking the doors before i go to sleep. i almost feel bad for him. almost. except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job. i never asked for money like he does. i can't understand where his money goes either. he doesn't go anywhere he can't drive. but still he has no money. other than food i don't know where it goes i think he just puts it in a shoe box until he can afford a video 
__label__label0   Well, I think that I need to practice working on my team games more. My teammates and I have very little coordination amongst ourselves, we always just end up doing things individually instead of as a team. PROPNAME usually ends up spamming huntresses by himself in a corner, PROPNAME makes a few footman and then techs to knights, which usually then get killed, and I try to scout or tech myself. Their is no over-arching strategy to our game, which is the problem. In a one-on-one game, I only have to be concerned with what I am doing and making, and only what my single enemy is doing or making. I have decided to dub the name of our team   Team Suck  , because we are that terrible. Oh well, I can still tower rush the newbs on battle. net any day.      Amazingly enough, I don't have a lot of work to do tonight, aside from this assignment I'm doing right now so that I can go ahead and have it out of the way. Hopefully, I won't have any work to do this weekend when the fam comes to visit. And even if I do, I will just do as much as I can on Sunday night instead of burdening myself with it while they are here. It's not that I don't have a work ethic, it's just that I prioritize doing things with them above reading out of a textbook, which I will be doing all the time while I am here at LOCNAME. They are only going to be around for a few days, and then I may not see them again until the next break.     I wonder when it will start getting cold around here, I brought my jacket, but I shouldn't need it until October or so I believe. My bathroom is quite the feces-infested cesspool right now, I should probably do something about that. It's beginning to get kind of nauseating, but perhaps if I can out-last the guy next door, he will do it before I do. Pretty sick, I know, but I did it when I first got here and I'll be damned if I get to do it every time. I should also vacuum the room, that is getting pretty disgusting as well. Crumbs and such will attract all kinds of vermin eventually. I wonder how often (if ever) they spray for bugs around here. A couple of times I've gone into the bathroom and found one in the tub or on the floor. One time I actually stepped on one before I knew what it was in the dark. That was quite nasty.     There Zendt goes, IMing me while I'm doing my writing assignment. must not answer it. must continue my non-sequitious train of thought. i wonder if I spelled non-sequitious correctly. If i spent a few seconds checking it on dictionary. com it shouldn't cut into my writing. aw screw it, who cares if the prof or LOCNAME or whoever reads this thinks im an illiterate boob. I don't think they are checking on spelling anyway. I bet there are other stream of consciousness writings by students who have trouble writing in english because they are from other countries, so why should I care if i have a few typos. I could pretend I'm a foreigner from LOCNAME or some crap, even if it did matter. Except now I've written it in here, so they would have incriminating evidence. Wow, this is too much digression into an idiotic train of thought. Must think of something else to type about. . . . . .     Um, i think I'm losing my focus a little now. man, my nails are dirty, look at that. That charcoal I've been using is a damn mess. I hope that we don't do too many more charcoal drawings now. Those blind contour drawings are so much cleaner.  I wonder if they will egver get more cups in the kitchen. I am getting pretty effin' sick of bringing my own cup to dinner. that is pure bovine-cacka. I wonder if they care about me typing cuss words in here. better not do it just to be on the safe side. Must try to maintain some false sense of professionalism. time. is. almost. . . up. . . . . NOW 
__label__label1 so today i went to class and i am really really tired i don't know why because in high school i was never this tired and i never slept that much during the day now i sleep a lot more i have breaks in between my classes and i don't like it because i don't do anything useful during those breaks i either eat, sleep, watch my suitemates tv or sit and stare at the wall, i think that i have a obessive compulsive shopping disorder because i always want to shop i like to shop and i always spend too much money i have the money from my parents but i should learn to save it but they did give it to me for clothes but i still shouldnt shop that much well oh well i like it so i do it i really like my dorm i want to decorate the living room more but my roommate and my room is cute and everyone says that it is homely i hung up all my picutes the other day and i like it alot i really like my stuff i think it is extremely cute it looks like a model dorm room it should because it took me forever to pick out what to buy and i got frames for all my pictures to match and my mom is making me a lamp to match it is going to be awesome well now my boyfriend is going to come over and we are going to watch a movie that should be fun oh i forgot that are suitemates are having movie night oh well we can just watch it with them i never get pimples but i have a really huge one right now and it is aggrevating me to death i guess that i am really concerned with my physical appearance but i can't help it anyways i don't know what else to write umh the elevators at dobie are extremely annoying because they take forever and i always have to take the stairs from the 00 floor i hate it but i never take them up maybe i should to work off calories oh that reminds me i really need to start working out again i have slacked off since summer school ended and fall started i should start running again too i could go with my friend i will give her a call later well something is wrong with my labtop because any time i type too fast it stops and sends me to the upper portion of the page i hate it then i have to use the mouse to get back down to start typing again i think that i am a true perfectionist it even shows in this writing assignment because anytime i spell a word wrong i have to go back and retype it the right way i wonder why i do that oh i miss my car because i put it in the shop yesterday and i can't get it until tomorrow it is no big deal i don't drive it that much down here anyway but i just like to know that i can drive when i want to it is going to cost like 000 dollars to get the oil changed and the brake pads changed and the rotars grinded down they also had to give me a new ignition for something because of a recall i have a 00 honda accord (it is so nice i love my car fully loaded and everything all the extras) and they recalled the ignition because it can just stall out when you are driving that is scary my stepmom called me and was worried because if i was driving on the freeway and it stalled it would not be good i said hey if someone hit me and maybe i would just get hurt enough so that i could sue honda and get enough money to pay for college and be able to drive my bmw and go on shopping sprees with my sisters, and mothers and all the time that would be nice so i havent talked to my sister in awhile she is very sick not sick in a flu way but in a internal way like the brain and heart i love her so much and i am going to call her as soon as i am done with this so that i can tell her how much i love her and when i go home we can hang out and i will take her and some of her friends to a movie and to eat i think that i need to get a job my dad does not want me too and he gives me money but i want to you know 
__label__label0      thank god the day is almost over. Today was the draw for tickets to the ORGNAME game. It was an incredibly hectic day because all of the pledges of my fraternity had to wake up early to get to the stadium so we could draw tickets for all of the actives. Not to mention all the walking we had to do which was especially painful for me because i slice off a huge piece of skin off the back of my heel so it hurts every step I take. Lacrosse practice is also tonight and the gash on my heel is going to be extremly painful tonight when he have to run. I am also still sore from tuesday's lacrosse practice. I am glad that I finally sat down to complete this assignment because i have been putting it off all week. Tomorrow I am going to LOCNAME to visit my parents. I am extremely excited to be going back to LOCNAME especially since we have a new dog. My parents got a weiner dog puppy. It has short hair on its body and hairy ears, i cannot wait to play with it. All i can think about is how i have been running around all day today and even last night. My pledge brothers and I had to go around to other dorms and knock on random people's doors asking them for their UT ID's so we could use their sports packages to draw tickets for our fraternity. I am also pledge class president and have realized that it is going to consist of me doing alot of crap. The pledge trainer talked to me today and talked to me about my responsibilities and I have a feeling that some of my pledge brothers might let me down. I went to bed at 0 this morning and woke up at 000, I am so tired, i just wish i could go to sleep right now, but i can't because i have to go to a mandatory BA 000 lecture in an hour. I am also going home this weekend so that i can have my parents do my laundry because i know that they will do a much better job than i would. I am also going to see some of my friends in LOCNAME who are now seniors in high school, including my old girlfriend and a couple of other pretty girls. I haven't seen them in a while and it should be a good time. My suitemate's cell phone just rang and I imagine that it is the fraternity calling him. He is my pledge brother but he is kind of annoying, we just let him as to pad the numbers since we were a few pledges short. My leg muscles are still aching from lacrosse practice and my heel injury is haunting me. I am going to be late to practice because i have my BA000 lecture til 000 and practice begins at 0, which is good because that means i will not have to run the compound, which is a lap around the fenceline of the intramural field complex, it is one hell of a run. Since i have been here I have not really watched much television so I am falling behind on my favorite sports teams, especially the astros. The texans won their first game last weekend and it was one hell of a game. Me and my buddy ordered wings and that was the start of our ritual for texans games. My roomate just walked in and wanted to know if i wanted to go swimming but the towers pool is disgusting and i will never go swimming there. Two girls just came to the door to get their IDs which i had to use to draw tickets for the OU game. I had to throw on a shirt because i was half naked and they were gone when i came back, but oh well. One of the girls who came by is my date to the OU game. OU weekend is going to be extremely fun,  It will basically consists of getting trashed several nights in a row and watching the horns kick OU's ass. Our fraternity rented a charter bus and it is going to be a good time. I am about to get dressed and ready for lacrosse practice so that right after my lecture i can catch the bus to the field. THe bus i have to catch is the IF bus and i have no idea where it picks up so hopefully i will be able to make it to the field at a decent time. If not, i would be perfectly content going back to towers and sleeping. But i have calculus homework that is due at 0 am so later i have to have my buddy help me out because i do not understand somne of the work, i am a little over half way done but it should not take very much longer. My roomate is awfully weird, why the hell would he want to live in towers his sophomore year. It would be much cheaper to rent an apartment with some friends rather than live in towers and deprive me of the chance of making a good friend out of my roomate. He is just so boring and always is around, even when i bring girls home, it is freekin annoying. the problem with this assignment is that some of the thoughts i am tracking are thought about what i am going to write next which makes this seem artificial because i have to think about what i am thinking about. I have had 0 hours of sleep in the last 00 hours are so and i am damn tired, i need a freekin nap and i think i am about to hit the snooze button for 00 minutes 
__label__label0     Wow I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing for this assignment. I knew about a book that I was supposed to read in English class last year that was supposedly written in stream of consciousness but since i never read it I have no idea what it was about. Instead I read Crime and punishment. that was probably the most depressing book i have ever read. right now I'm reading a tom clancy novel, which is much more exciting. I can't wait to go back to dallas this weekend to see my family and girlfriend. they are all so excited. plus i get to see my grandma and actually get some real food. Man the food here sucks. sure there's variety, but half the time they don't even have something green out there. I mean how the hell are we not supposed to get that freshmen 00 if they aren't even giving us some friggin green beans. My allergies are killing me. i think i almost died last nite i was coughing so much, and i'm sure i kept my roommate up. but i don't really care. he shafted me. he was going to give me a ride to dallas this weekend but instead, he made his girlfriend come down so now he won't take me. He could have just seen her down there, but he didn't want to have to be around adult supervision for that long. oh well, i'll get him back. hehehe. yeah so my arms are definitely starting to get tired. i definitely haven't done this much typing since fourth grade with PROPNAME PROPNAME. that was the year that I was introduced, and subsequently failed fractions. damn i hate fractions. with mrs. hatch. evil lady. there is so much reading that i have to do for my classes but so far i am really liking them. i took five pages of notes today in my architecture class, but at the end i was ready to take more. we were talking about hitler and the nazi's, but mainly about the architect that hitler hired to build his sets for his speeches, and the headquarters of the nazi party. I'm now listening to pink floyd and i feel as though i'm on a space ship. this is some crazy stuff. i use this cd to put me to sleep every nite. and usually by the second song i'm asleep. it is so cold in this room i'm having to crap, somebody's knocking on the door. ok i'm back;. now where was i. ah yes my toes probably have frost bite now i could get up and turn up the thermostat but then i start sweating profusely and that's definitely no good. it's been very hard for me to meet people in my dorm so far. i'm in the new dorm, san jacinto, and it's like a hotel.  since everyone has their own bathrooms no one really has a chance to mingle, because they're always going somewhere. everyone seems like they're on a mission and they'll kill you if you get in their way. i'm not exactly the most outgoing guy in the world, so let me tell you it's more than intimidating. i had such a close, great group of friends in high school that i could tell anything to. and they felt the exact same way. now, i have no one to talk to except a few of my friends that came here. The problem with that is, i just know too many people here, so there's always someone to hang out with, we just don't get new people to hang out with. and it's also kind of pointless if you sit down and think about it. because the odds are, if you see someone somewhere and introduce yourself to them, you very well may never even see them again. I mean, how much does that suck. ooh this is my favorite part of the song. shine on you crazy diamonds. wow, that just made me think of band banquet from last year and i have absolutely no idea why. unless it's because my date was wearing a gold sequine dress and was definitely shining. yeah, that's prolly it. oh lord my hands are tired. i'm so out of shape. i've definitely lost like 00 pounds of muscle over the summer. and now, everyone here is huge. i was big back in high school, but comparatively, i'm a stinkin shrimp. and i really don't have any particular skill at any sport. i played soccer in high school, but i played goalie and i hate it now. i'm average at any sport but i don't really excel at anything in particular so i'm at a decided disadvantage. 
__label__label0      I don't understand many of the girls on my hall. They are all so immature and obnoxious. I want to meet mew people but I have a hard time giving any of these girls a real chance. I miss my little sisters and worry about them. My mother worries a lot about all of the things they may get into that are bad for them. I kind of screwed things up for them. I shouldn't have gotten into so much trouble in high school. It was fun though. I am so far away from anything I am familiar with. I have been away from home many times and it does not bother me. I did not realize being in school would disruot my comfort zone in the way that it has. I want to experience Austin but have no on to experience it with and am afraid to go out alone, especially at night. I feel full and I love ice cream. I am very tierd for no reason at all. I am worried that I will not be able to find some really good friends. I am excited. I got a really good wristband for the OU game. Hell yeah!!!  I went to dinner with one of my neighbors tonight and I just know everything she said to me was a total crock of shit. I don't understand why people lie like that, maybe she is an obssessive compulsive liar. I hate computers, I hate how the entire system of life is now dominated by them. They are just machines, not people. American's are so detatched. September eleventh is tomorrow. The last stream of conciousness I did was about PROPNAME PROPNAME and Peeps. I love Peeps. Why do they only make them at Easter. Just like egg nog at Christmas. You can only have egg nog at Christmas though. It's like an overload of egg nog if you have a lot of it. Moderation is important. My roomie is nothing like me. How in the hell did we end up living together. It's because my mom altered my questionaire. The lack of freedom!!!!!  I think it is awful that they put animals into zoos. That should be illegal. They could have rehab clinics for the ones that they rescue but they shouldnt make their mony off of people coming in to look at them. I talked to a guy that was a Comp something or other major and when I asked him what that was he said he didn't know!!  How can you not know what your major is???  That is just wrong. I think he was just messing with me. I went to ground zero, it really impacted me in a different way. I never know if I am ding stream of conciousness writing the right way. There is no right way though. I HATE COMPUTERS. Typing was invented by the devil. The home keys???  I just hate them. Music is so important to us. I wish I had a larger vocabulary. Why do people use people?  I only have a little bit left. When I work out only 00 seconds or a single repetition can last forever. I guess I'm feelin' alright. It's all going to be good in the end. 
__label__label0 Its really hard to write what I am thinking about because when I am asked to do that, I think about what to write. I then go and think of other things that are on my mind and really don't need to be shared with the general public. What I am physically feeling right now is heat. Our house is hot although we have the a/c running non stop. Mentally, I am confused. The thoughts that go through my head at times make me think that I am crazy and that I should seek help. I am not the only one who thinks that but my family members and my friends also think that I should get some help. But truthfully, there is no help. Who controls the mind?  Ones self controls the mind. All I really have to do is concentrate and I can control myself. Powerful things can be accomplished with mind control. Its odd how sometimes I know what people are going to ask me before they ask me. It happens allot. Then people look at me in an akward form. I don't know how that happens. It just does. I can also go through the thought process of other people. Sometimes, when my friends perform certain actions, I can think the exact same thing they were thinking at the time they were doing that. The only time this thought process causes a problem is when I am reading the news and read about acts of violence against children. Its not that great when you can place yourself in the shoes of the aggressor when you really don't want to. Its all invouluntary. This would be allot easier if I was writing in pencil. I think faster when I am writing things down. It helps me organize my thoughts. When I speak to people, I like to confuse them. Sometimes I confuse them so much, they believe that a conclusion was reached at the end of our conversation but when they think about it, they find out that I only caused them to think of more questions. I don't know why I enjoy that. When we think, what do we think about the most?  What is easier or what needs a solution. Writing about what I think is hard. I am not sure if I think of too many things at once or just don't think at all. I do just stop thinking and drift off into my own world and just stay there, thoughtless?  Feelings:  mixed feelings. Not sure what to do with my life. Would prefer not to be in college but know that sucess comes with knowledge. Psychology has interested me since I was a child. I like knowing what people are thinking about. That is what I do; I observe. But observation comes with a price. Since I play the role of observer, it is hard for me to actually detail what is going on in my day and not others. People think that I really don't want to talk much about myself (which is true to some extent). What really happens is that I don't know how to organize my daily activities to be shared with others. Silence is my audience when I am by myself. But when I need to concentrate and do my homework, I need noise. I can not concentrate where it is quiet. The silence distracts me. When I read, I listen to music. When I do other homework that does not involve reading, I listen to music, talk to others, and also do the homework of another class at the same time. I need distractions to concentrate. Another physical pain came to my mind. I have back pain. Most times, I take pain killers to ease the pain. The pain killers I use arent that effective and they are stong pain killers. I take Hydrocodone and Naproxen 000 mg each. I sometimes take two naproxen and one hydrocodone or vice versa. That does very little to ease the pain. Since they are so effective, I just don't take them and deal with the pain. Thanks to my servere back pain, I am now not affected by other types of pain. I need a new body. I also have knee pains. I have joint pain. I am overweight. I need to do something with my life. Something new. I would like to skydive. Life is not worht living if you don't take risks. I ran out of things to write about. I lost my stream of consciousness. I need the weekend to be here so that I can catch up on my homework. I procrastinate too much. I have talked to a psychiatrist before. It really didnt help. Nothing helps. Once must deal with their problems themself and keep them to themself. Contorl them with ones mind and keep them undercontrol.  
__label__label0 Wow! This has been a crazy day! I am really overwhelmed by everything. I'm sitting in my dormroom right now and and all I can't think about is last night. I'm still really really mad. All of these rude girls were running down the hall at 0:00 in the morning, screaming, yelling,and slamming doors. I got only a few hours of sleep. This really sucks especially since I came home early from LOCNAME just so I could sleep. I could have spent the night there and hung out with PROPNAME, my boyfriend if i had known that i would be kept up that late. Oh yeah, I really miss PROPNAME right now! He's supposed to call me today when he gets out of class, which was about, uh, two hours ago. I could just call him but first of all, i am typing this right now and can't stop for about 00 more minutes, and second, i am trying that stupid oldfashioned stuff where you let the guy call you. The tv is on in here and i kind of want to change the channel because they are talking about Sept. 00th. That's so depressing and I think that I am depressed enough right now with all of this new stuff in my life. I liked my house and my room in my house and my town where i knew my way around and my tutoring job that payed well, and my cozy school where I have gone since kindergarten. I miss my mom and dad, and friends, but most of all I miss my dog! DID I TELL YOU THAT I MISS MY DOG, PROPNAME? She is the one who undepresses me. How can you be upset when she is begging for your approval and looking at you with that puppy dog face that is that is the ultimate model of pure love. Oh yeah- I just heard something about American Idol, that t. v. show. THe girl who won, PROPNAME PROPNAME, is from LOCNAME, a small towm outside of LOCNAME LOCNAME. That is where my boyfriend is from, which just brings me back to the fact that I miss PROPNAME right now. Now all i can think about is the fact that I am such a typical girl; all i can think about is my boyfriend! oh well, it's better tan thinking about the mean girls that i have to live with. They are so unthoughtful. My brother told me to live here and that i would meet some of my best friends for life here. Yeah right! I hate all of these girls. All of my friends live somewhere else. I pretty much always take his advise because he is really smart and after all, he is my big brother. But i think he was wron on this one. I guess I am finished. Yeah, i better get ready for dinner, but this is pretty addicting to write all of this down, even though none of this make any sense to you. Oh well, bye bye. 
__label__label0      my room is so cold i have so much to do and not enough time  i need to go home soon  how will i get tickets to the parents weekend game?  im so busy i wish it was christmas already  this semester is already too long  i wish i hadnt been to summer school i wish i would have been able to stay home and gone to the beach  i am so full i shouldnt have had that big meal  this movie my roommate is watching is really wierd  kind of scary  i need to do my laundry and clean my room  i need to start readin g and i am scared that i am going to get bad grades and my dad will be mad at me  my grades from the summer werent good enough i need to bring up my gpa  i miss my friends  i miss my boyfriend  i need ot get his birthday present  and i need to figure out when i am going to go home again  i need to go see my friends at college station next weekend  molly is coming in october i am really excited  i wish jeep went to school with me  i miss him so much  sometimes i think my roommates sleep too much and talk on the phone too much  one is obsessed with her boyfriend  but she cheated on him?  i don't understand how people can do that to the people that they love  i could never do that to jeep  it is just too heartless  i miss michael  he is so cute  i am really happy that i went tri-delt i love the people that i pledged with im glad im not a theta  i really don't like allison sample  she is so annoying  sometimes she really really bothers melike she tries to be my best friend even though she knows we arent  god she annoys me and she tries to pretend that she is friends with all my best friends  i don't tihkn im going to make a very good grade in my media class  i don't know what to do  im kind of scared  i hope that everything works out between jeep and i and i hope that we don't break up  im really scared that it might not work out  but i really hope it does  i love him so much  i don't really think i fit in with alot of people here and i don't have that many guy friends here which i miss and i miss dave alot  i don't like not having any guy friends here it is really wierd without them  they were the only people i was friends with i really hope that our apartment thing works out next year i think it could be really fun  i am really scared that i am going to gain the freshmen 00  god i do not want to gain any weight  i need to start exercising i need to start eating healthy  i need to send these thank you cards to mrs stanbery and minnie and catherine  god catherine is so wierd i can't believe she is related to me  she is very socially backward  i feel bad for her  and i feel bad for their whole family  god my back is hurting from sitting up so long  i thikn i have back problems katie is so wierd sometimes  i don't get her sometimes  i probably should go to the time management lecture it would probably help me out alot since i need help in that area  i need to get myself motivated to do work  i did alot of work today and i feel like i got alot accomplished  i did my laundry i did my chemistry i did my psychology i did my architecture and i did some media journal homework i want my cd burner back these actors are really bad 
__label__label0      okay. my thoughts and feelings. I have now attended all of my classes for the semester. The first couple days I guess are all just intros and basics and the how to's. Interesting, but I think more interesting is the possibility of what they, the classes, offer for the future. My roomate just left the room to go over to one of her friends rooms. I haven't but briefly met anybody she would have refered to as a friend before she came here, but i think that that would probably give me a better understanding of what she is like. I wish I could type faster, it seems like decades since my typing class in the seventh grade. I can't believe that I am finally 00. It seems like I was the last one of my friends to turn into adult hood or whatever 00 makes me. hey I can vote now,  I still can't legally drink, ummmm I have to pay more for admission to things like ammusment parks. It reminds me of when I turned tweleve and they wouldn't let you eat of the child's menu suddenly. Yeah your still not really old enough, they just call you a teenager, or an adult and take away priveledges without really adding any benefits. My ex boyfriend and I are friends again. but still way weird around each other. my mom just helped me fix my computer after a virus invaded at 00:00 this AM. I was not yet out of class because my tour of the workshop in design class ran just a bit long. one of those oh my god are the seconds actually moving backward kind of ten minutes. Don't worry, I surrived. whooh hooo  it has now been ten minutes. That makes this the hump minute. i guess. My best friend in the whole wide world  yeah look at that alliteration   always called the fourth hour in our shift the hump hour because we were on the downward side of the hill, over the hump, more than half way done. We worked in a child care and i absolutely thought that it was like the best job for eight dollars an hour ever. I love playing with kids, and in fact enjoy acting like one most of the time, but if I was ever tired or not in the mood my only real responsibility was to keep them from hurting themselves or each other   oh and take out the diaper genie. speaking of genies. like the one in the lamp, i must have watched ORGNAME 00 times this summer, a close second to the little mermaid which is still a favorite of mine. I think it would be fun to animate disney movies   except I have a major problem with all the second sequiels I suppose you would call them  yeah this doesn't really have spell check so I guess that will just slip by, or auto correct for that matter, which though often anoying is very helpful  or hurtful for the bad capitalization habits it creates. dun nun nun nun i am excited about my first year at ut and about architecture and about meeting new people. My roomate seems nice, very considerate, always a good thing. I am not totally thrilled that i didn't get to move out of LOCNAME given that I grew up here and in fact lived on the same street my entire life. It is different riding the bus instead driving my car around. I feel like i have so much new freedom, but that the car being out of the picture took away a very different freedom. I know navigation by roads, however not so well yet by capital metro numbers and colored lines. . hey its free   it only took me an hour start to finish to get home today. it was about six oclock. that means some of it was traffic, but i estimate it takes about 00 to 00 minutes longer to get ala me casa. 
__label__label0      It amazes me that I have known about this writing assignment for a while now, and yet I wait to do it until the night before the deadline. I don't procrastinate too terribly much but sometimes I guess I do. I'm really tired. I stayed up until about three in the morning reading for my government class. Then I had to wake up at about seven. I don't even know why I woke up that early. We entered the draw for the ORGNAME football tickets and everyone I talked to said to get there early. So I wake up and drag my self down there, with only a few hours of sleep. I was pretty irritated when I found out that it was by number order, so it actually didn't matter. I must have misunderstood when they were giving the instructions. I guess it's just one of those dumb freshman things. I'm actually not as nervous as I expected to be. I came from a town of 0000, smaller than most people's high schools. Everyone told me that I was going to be sad and cry a lot. Suprisingly I haven't been upset once. Sure I miss my mom, dad, sisters, etc. but i've been pretty good. I do miss my boyfriend. He's great. That was pretty hard. I cried more when I left him than my parents. Don't really know what that means. I was just use to seeing him everyday and now I hardly get to talk to him. He's still great though. I hope it all works out okay. I know it will. What's meant to be is meant to be though. I've sort of learned the hard way that I can't decide my own fate, I've tried to change things but they still end up the way I worried they would, but they ended up okay. I guess He does know what he's doing. He's pretty good at it. Yesterday was kind of hard. The September 00th memorial service and hearing the story was sort of difficult. I got to go to LOCNAME LOCNAME this summer. My mom took me and my sisters for my graduation. Pretty Nice gift. She and my sisters have had it planned for over a year. It was my middle sister PROPNAME's idea, but then she was paniced after the attacks and almost didn't go. She was worried that she'd never see her little girls again. It was real sad, but we forced her to go. We had a wonderful time, yet a time that actually makes everything real, and put it all into perspective. It was truly amazing.   In my dorm we have a connecting bath. It's pretty nice but has an awkward smell. It took my roomate and I a very long time to figure it out and it's not jusr the regular bathroom smell. We've been watching our suitemates and figured it out. One of them drinks coffee and has been washing her dishes in the bathroom. Wierd, but I'm glad we figured it out, it was really starting to get on my nerves.   I've really been getting sick. I think I've been sick since I moved down here. I'm sure it's because I'm in a new setting and I don't sleep near as much as I should, but I guess I'll adjust. I called my doctor and he told me I needed ORGNAME ORGNAME, which wouldn't get me well but it would make me   feel better  , and some sleep. It's hard because I still use my old doctor. He's the only doctor I've ever had. I guess it's that comfort zone thing again. I've lived in the same town, on the same street, with the same neighbors, in the same house. I've had the same friends for eighteen years. It's sort of odd to be gone from everything.    The coolest thing happened to me this past weekend. My boyfriend got me tickets to go to PROPNAME PROPNAME so I went home. There was a   get together   before the concert so we went over to one of his friend's house. As I was walking in, this girl was coming out, she just looked at me and smiled, so naturally I smiled back. Then she said,   are you PROPNAME PROPNAME?   I was like Yeah. She looked at me and said,   I'm Crystal.  I was thinking okay?? then she said   your best friend.  She was my best friend from Kindergarten to Second grade. She had to move to LOCNAME with her family. Then she moved to a little town, lifeguarded in another town where she met her boy friend PROPNAME, who happens to be one of my friends cousins. It's such a small world. PROPNAME and PROPNAME hang out so he has known her for a while. It's so exciting. 
__label__label0      000, I never actually listened to them. man my eyes itch. wow, Im supposed to be typing instead ORGNAME talking to PROPNAME. Man, this song is so melodic and soothing. It reminds me of sandy beaches and sunshine. Well anyway this is college, dorms filled with all of the decor of people's personalities and homes from their towns. Sometimes I wonder why people are the way they are. It's quite complex and difficult, but I'm sure their environment had a lot to do with their personalities and social qualities. I truly believe thORGNAME social qualities mean a lot. People need to understand that everyone is different and because, don't read this  PROPNAME. The song has changed into a classical melody and by the same band, oh no, Tool. Music, is a language everyone can speak. You can't go wrong with music. It's a huge part of my life. wow, PROPNAME ( tool song) is redone with orchestra instruments. Aenima is an interesting song about Armageddon. Speaking of Armageddon, is God going to come to LOCNAME, or PROPNAME for that matter. Biologically, we are just organisms living out our lives. And for what?  To not sin and go to heaven?  There are so many religions out there, I mean, controversy is going to be a given. Why is PROPNAME reading this. Is he interested in what is on my mind. Well anyway, Respect for other's religions is something I find extremely important and essential to understand at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. Instead of looking at a muslim and saying   holy shit what's up with that   just think to yourself how they see your religion and judge yourself. Live, and let live. Have respect. I feel as though people close to me in my home in LOCNAME do not realize the respect I have for them. They never realize, is this the same orchestrated song by tool, hold for 0 sec please. Alright some middle time ORGNAME, their a gothic punk band, that can be described as purity in darkness. They are one of my favorite punk bands. Sometimes I wonder what the lives of PROPNAME PROPNAME and Afi are like. They seem as though they are really nice people. Having taken a picture and briefly and nervously talked to them. Yeah PROPNAME PROPNAME, a legend. Now thats good stuff. I mean who doesnt like PROPNAME PROPNAME?  His music flows through your body like the many pints of blood do. You just want to sit back and enjoy a nice beverage, for me preferably corona and a nice tequila of some sort. Not partying or whatever; it's wierd how we use party as a verb. LOCNAME soldier in a war for LOCNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME used his fair share of pot, but he did not die from it. Who dies from cannibus?  Is it really that bad?  Should we legalize it? LOCNAME's police force seems more concerned with other crimes than Marijuana. Personally,  I believe marijuana is better  
__label__label0      I thnik that after this I'll do my chemistry homework and get it out the way. It will probably take me forever eventhough it's only 00 questions because I still need to read. My Incubius CD is ending. I need to ask PROPNAME to start it again. I am wonder how I'm going to really learn how to speak Latin. I know I'll be able to read and Write it. When is my computer going to come in?  I feel like I'm intruding on PROPNAME everytime I use her lap top. I'm drawing a blank. Get up PROPNAME. I'm never good at this stream of thought stuff cause I'm always thinking about the stream of thought like in english class last year when Mrs. PROPNAME asked us to do it for. . I guess it was ten minutes. I miss her. I miss PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wonder what PROPNAME's doing right now. Probably out somewhere in LOCNAME. I love this song. I really want to play guitar. I hope I make the band next year. That dream was wierd last night or this morning or something like that. Singing would be so often for a living. I've always liked being on the go constantly. I'm so organized and yet never organized enough. I wanna' here my song again. That's so wierd, when one song is on you can't think of another on. Those girls next door were really loud earlier today. What were they doing?  I don't dress up very much. I still don't understand how people can where heels to an amusement park. Six Flags was fun this summer. I love this song. I'd love to see them live. I wonder what there like in person. He has such an amazing voice.  I wonder how my voice would improve if I were to take lessons. I need to exercise more. That would definitly improve my lung capcity and my playing. I'm so upset I didn't make the band. I'm proud of myself though because I sightread music while everyone else had had their music for a whie. What am I going to play next year for an audition. I don't know. I need to practice again. Is my music here?  I need to send the pool key to my mom. I also need to find a church before my mom kills me. I want to go see My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Maybe we'll go sometime this week. I don't know. How much time left. Okay. Um. I did a really. times up. 
__label__label1      Well, I'm here in LOCNAME LOCNAME visiting Ty. I love it here. I wish I didn't have to go back to school on monday. ORGNAME's fun, but everything reminds me of how alone I am. I feel loved here. Even if there isn't a constant stream of people through the room here, like at LOCNAME, I'm entertained and happy. I think that the people coming through my room at the dorm is the only thing keeping me from breaking down and crying. I don't know how I'm going to get through a semester, much less a year, or even 0 years. I don't have depression (at least I don't think so), I think it's just the pressures of school. Everyone says it gets better after the first semester. I hope that happens. On another topic. Ty has downloaded some great guitar music. I love it. I'm going to burn a copy before I go back to LOCNAME. He's working on his homework right now. I never realized how much I would miss him, even though we're only an hour and a half away. He's the only person who I trust enough to be myself around. And he loves me anyways, which is really the part I can't believe. I can't wait until next year when he's at LOCNAME with me. I should call my mom sometime. I've been home once, for a few hours, but really I haven't talked to my parents all that much. I guess that's okay, and honestly, I don't miss them much. They got me to a point of being pretty self-sufficient awhile back I think. Sometimes though, it sucks, because i want help, but they won't give it to me. I guess it has made me a stronger person. Ty wants me to help him with his physics homework. I had to remind him that I'm a business major, and that I nearly failed physics in high school. He makes me laugh. He'll make a wonderful engineer someday. So gifted in math and science. I wish I had his math logic. Unfortunately for me, I don't. Calculus is going to KILL me this semester. There are pretty posters on Ty's walls. There's a gorgeous one of saturn and 0 of it's moons. I don't remember, does saturn have more than 0 moons? I really want a Dr. Pepper. I haven't had any caffiene today because there isn't any in this apartment. I guess I'm kind of getting a headache from the lack of caffiene, but I'll live. We're going to go grocery shopping and get food soon. I can't believe it's only been 00 minutes. I've typed a crapload of stuff. As much as I'm dreading / not enjoying school, I do have to say I'm happy with most of my classes. Just getting professors that are fluent in English is quite an accomplishment these days it seems. I wish the cut on my foot would heal up, it really hurts. My favorite color is green. I just realized that I packed all green shirts for this weekend. And I think about half of the shirts I own are some variance on a shade of green. And I don't consciously buy green. analyze that. Well, the roadrunner man is coming this week to give us cable internet in our dorm room, so at least I'll be able to see ty on the webcam from now on. That's actually exciting, because the internet access in my dorm room sucks. Wow, I'm a dork. I think Ty's dorkiness has rubbed off on me. God, I've even started liking STAR TREK. That's probably a sign that I'm officially a nerd. All these girls in my dorm rushed for sororities, and I realized last week that I have nothing in common with them other than we are in the same species. And even that is questionable. They all spew off these greek letters and I'm completely clueless about who or what they're talking about. One of those situations that it's best to just smile and nod. And living on the 00th floor of the dorm is such a pain in the ass. Having to wait a good 00 minutes for an elevator to take you down every morning. Being the last to get off of a crowded un-airconditioned elevator. We have a great view, but I don't think that the hassle is worth it. I need a new stereo to compete with my next-door neighbor's guitar amp. He can't really play guitar very well either, so maybe I should just invest in some good noise blocking headphones. Or earplugs. Earplugs are probably the cheaper option here. oh the joys of dorm life. Time's almost up! PROPNAME 
__label__label0 RIght now I'm thinking about not that much. I'm actaulyl ratehr relaxed. I'm thinking about how I miss my boyfirend, even though he is jsut on the otehr side of the room. It's one of those thigns where you're just really happy about a person and you can't stop thinking about them. He's just sitting there playing a video game and I'm really excited, but yet I still miss him and think about him. It's a rather cool feeling. I'm also thinking about my writting assingment in my rhetoric class. I've been trying to find stuff for it all day, and it's driving me crazy,a nd I still have more homework to do for it later, so that is still on my mind. I'm thinking also that I want to listen to music. Music relaxes me a lot, and I really enjoy listening to it will I'm doing mindless things. I enjoy it at other times too. I'm also craving sweets a lot. I'm addicted to them, so that's not really that unusual. I'm trying to rmemeber where a resturatnt is in LOCNAME. Prior to this I read an email from my mother telling me about wehre her and my father ate for their 00th weding anneversary, but I couoldn't really htink of where it is. I'm also trying to think about waht kind of food htey sereve. Earlier in teh day I watched hte first half of hte TExns game, so I'm also wondering if they won or not. My sister is also awayu at college, we're twins, and I'm wondering if any day things willl get better. It's the first time we've been apart and she's having a miserable time, so I'm wondering constantly how she's doing,a nd what I can do to make it better for her. Randomly I also think about my parents. I just read an email from one of htem, so taht's why they are currently on my mind. Normally I wouldn't miss them, but my dad had a heart attack a few days before I moved up here, so I think about him a lot more htat I probably would. My email from my mom realated to how they're eating, so that got me thinking on that. I'm also thinking about my math class. I have homework to do in tehre later tonight. I really don't like the calss. It's riddle math, so I spend my time wondering about how I'm going to get thropugh there. Currently I  m trying to think of how to jsut get through my homework, muchless my tests. THer are no equations, so it drives me crazy. I really don't want to even look at my homework. It's about the only homework I've procratinated on since I  ve been here. I'm also wondering what is wrong with me in my current medical condition. I have dizzyness problems, and I'm trying ot think of a time when I can see a doctor. My sister is having them now too, so it's on my mind a lot more. Now I'm starting to feel stressed. Usually I don't feel stressed, but then again I usually don't write out things that have been flowing through my mind. I'm wondering if I can think of things to talk about for twenty minutes. It's actually somewhat hard given that it's only me talking, well typing and there is no one or anything to converse with on the other end. I'm also trying to figure out when I'll have time to get my boyfriends birthday gift. I've spent all day, and all week,a nd the past montsh trying to figure it out. But now   m going to go to  a store tommorrow to finally get something. But I'm worrying about if the store will actually have somethign that I can get. I've never been to this store, but at 0 tommorrow I will find out about the stuff int ehre. According to my firned she says that I'll be able to find stuff there. Hopefully I will, otehrewise I'll have to rushdeliver something here, and that cost extra money,a nd I'm constantly worrying about money. I am botehrd especially when I have to pay for unneccessary things. Which the extra shipping cost would fall into that category. I'm also thinking about what position I would like to run for. Earlier today I went to an RHA meeting. Unfortuantly I missed the first half, so I didn't get all the information. I'm thinking about being something for my wing, which is good if I want to be an RA next year. THe other positions seem like high positions where I would have to campaign a lot, and I  m not that type of person. I'm still worrying somewhat about if I would have to campaign for my wing thing. I really would preffer to do that, I just hope I don't lose to someone who just casually felt like running for it, and wasn't as into it as me. Kind of like the girls who I think of who voted not to keep the bathroom door unlocked. THose eveil people. Everytime I go to the bathroom, I really hate them, and wish they weren't so casual about their voting no. Everyone had to vote yes, otherwise it would remain unlocked. Rather unfair. But I really get annoyed even when I see them. I've been sitting in front of htis computer too long today doing school work. I  m actaully quite frustrated with the internet. I needed to find a very simple thing, but yet the search engines would not co-operate and gave me horrible feedback for the sites. THe noise of hte video game in the background is rather interesting. I'm not much into video games, unless I get to shoot something, but I still wonder what's going on over there. Or how guys are entrigued for hours by a simple mouse or control set. The same screen, all day long. I've wondered if it actually   fries   people's brains when they play. Or if it interferes with their education, as in if they played video games their whole childhood. The noises on the video game are starting to remind me of hte noises that my boyfriend makes. I'm wondering howmuch time the wing representative will take. Supposedly it's only one hour, but I wonder if there's something hidden in tehre. I'm not sure if I'll be able to manage that, flag football, with practices nad games, and a soccer team with my floor. I'm not sure how to tell my best friend if I dont' want to play. I do want to play, I just don't know if I'll have the time. But I also wnat to meet peoiple on my floor and spend time with my best friend. So that is a rather hard argument. Why does life have so many conflicting htings, and not enough hours in teh day. I want to just expand time, and do everythign I want, and stop rushing through it and      
__label__label1     Today, i started the day with a serve headache. All day long this feeling has been with me from my first class to work to homework. In the early months i was told that i had a tumor near my pitutary gland. Ever since then I was put on some medication to help dissolve this tumor. Friday, i was schedule to have a MRI done, well today the result came back. As the doctor reported, i the medicine is working well. I just have to keep taking the medication. What a big relief. I felt great that i will not have to have surgery to remove the tumor. But lately, i have had headache that hurt realyy bad. When i toldmy mother, see thought i sgould get me eyes checked. She thinks that i need glasses. Who knows? I hope not. MAn, my brother is in the 0th grade and they required him to buy a recorder. Yes, he does not know how to play it. So it just sounds like a bunch of noise. This is what I hear in background as well as the loud tv that is showing commericals. I feel sleepy. Actually i don't know if there is time in which i am not sleepy. I work alot as a server and then get to come to do some homework before i fall asleep. So not much gets done. I wish there was just a day were i could relax, do something fun and not have to worry about what is due tomorrow, next week, in a couple of months get my drift. i know we just had a summer vaction. Well, i took summer school for the second half. so it feels like i have been in school for a couple of months. College is so much different from high school. Alot of responsibility is on the student. It is very easy to miess up. So far, i try to take one think at a time. It is hard to jugle 00 things at once, even if they are not school related. I deal with school, work ,friends, family and down time for myself which is usually the gym. One thing that i do miss is dealing with the boyfriend. After 0 0/0 yrs, i decided to break it off. I felt that i needed some breathing room. But there have been days were i miss  him. At those times, i just want him back but then i see that i can't just go and come when i want too. it is not fair to him. Lately i have been feeling lonely, very lonely. Especially since i don't see my friends as often because i live off campus, at home. Which means that i have some what of a curfew. Plus to travel from my house to campus is 00-00 way. Any way i really don't have time. This guy took very good care of me. I know, so why did i leave. Well he treated our relationship as we were, married. I could not even talk to friends with =out him geeting jealous or us getting a arguement. He wanted to spend all his free time with me and expected me to do the same. Well, i appreicate my friends and he did'n see that. 
__label__label0      Ok, here I go. I wonder what most people are thinking of when they are writing this. Probably all kinds of things. Well, I have a girlfriend, her name is PROPNAME, and today is our 00 month aniversary. I'm excited but I'm sad that I don't get to see her that much because she is still in high school. She goes to PROPNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME just like I did. That's where we met. We were both on the cross country team. I'm kind of tired. I wish I didn't have to spend all my time reading the Iliad. It's getting really boring and I don't even think it's a very good book. They just like it because it's old. Like last night I spent several hours reading it and I still had to do more before I went to class today. Man, it's only been 0 minutes, I don't think I can actually think for a whole 00. I wonder what I would be doing if I wasn't doing this right now. Probably doing calculus homework or reading, heaven-for-bid, the Iliad. I can't wait until the weekend when I can relax some more. At least I only have one class tomorrow and it's really easy. It's calculus and this is my third year in a row of taking it for I shouldn't have any trouble with it. Unfortunately though it's all stuff I've already learned so it's boring also. Let's see, that makes two boring classes now. How about ancient LOCNAME and BA000, those are also boring classes, but at least I like LOCNAME so at times that class can be interesting. So that leaves psychology, that's definitely the best class I'm taking, because it's really interesting. Especially because many of the things don't have answers so it's just what you think. I'm probably biased towards it though, because I've always been a math and science fan. Math was ruined by one teacher I had, but I still love science. Hopefully, I can use the business skills I learn to start or work for something like a bioengineering company, that would be cool. Psychology is also fun because I know a few people in there. One of the guys in there I went to pre-school and kindergarten with and haven't really seen him since. Monday I met this girl named PROPNAME. She's pretty nice so I have someone to talk to before class. PROPNAME just got home, I wonder where he's been. He probably was at class, I wonder which one. He really likes Cake and he just turned them on. I can tell when he's in his room usually because there is music on. He also likes the Beatles. I don't really like the Beatles but Cake is cool. I wonder who just got on AIM. I guess it was PROPNAME because he just IMed me. I wonder what he wants. Maybe I'll have to tell him to go away, but I probably won't, because I'm not that kind of person. I don't like putting people down or causing conflict. I guess that's just who I am. I am, I think that's the best quote I've ever heard. It can be interpreted in so many ways and it's the only think that we know is absolutely true. 
__label__label1      I am afraid of being here. I think that I am not smart enough or that I just don't have what it takes. I think about my boyfreind alot! he is my bestfriend. Sometimes I feel like I can't live without him. I hate feeling that way but i can't help it. my biology class is stupid. i hate sitting there for an hour and a half wondering what the heck she is talking about. i wonder what my mom is doing right now. my little sister is in school right now and is probably having way more fun than i am. i can't wait until october 0th it is going to be great. i get to finally see my boyfriend again after 0 months. gosh that seems like a long time. i wonder if he is thinking of me right now. i know he better have wrote a letter on sunday. i love getting his letters. they make me feel very happy and i read them over and over and over. sometimes i don't knwo if i am just kidding myself about our relationship but then i remember how much i miss him and how perfect we are together. is there actually soemthing out in the universe that is perfect?  is there some object that can meet standards that to majority is perfect?  i know i am not perfect. i am so nervous about gaining weight. i always watch what i eat but it always like too much no matter what i eat. i hate feeling that wat too. i love beanie babies. they are soo cute. i used to collect them but now I dont. not that its because i got older but just because i don't have the money to spend on them anymore. I wonder why people are the way they are. Some people can be soo mean but have no reason to be that way. I wonder if I am that way. I wonder if people see me as snobby or dumb. I always look around the room and i wonder if people are just as confused as me. I try to look as if i am not confused but i don't think it works to much. I want to move with my boyfriend. I want to be near him alwyas. I always think about him. Is that unhealthy?  I like pizza. it is vrey good i want pizza now. i love fruit too. i think fruit can be better than icecream although i love icecream too. if i had to choose right now i would eat a peach. i don't know why but tomorow i would probably eat icecream. I don't think that i fit into this city. i think sometimes that maybe i shoould have stayed in killen. i love music i have to listen to it in order to make my day start out good. i love dirty south music but then again i love all kinds of music. how can someone only like certain types of music?  i don't believ e that. they make themselves think that. I think that music is a form of expression and you should listen to the music before saying  what is that,country?     ewwww!    I love anything that makes me feel good inside. I kind of would like to move to florida. my friend PROPNAME lives there but i went there for a band trip and i had such a good time. i was with my boyfriend and we did everything. evreybody told us that they sat around. we went on every ride there was. then before my boyfriend left to the navy we went to LOCNAME LOCNAME. we went there all by our selves and did everything our way. no one  to tell us what to do or how to do it. it was great. We saved all our money and made sure we had enough to spend. I loved the shows at sea world. My favorite was fools with tools and how they made fun of all the other shows. It was great. There too me and my boyfriend went to every show and eveyr ride although there werent much rides. I hope we don't have to read our papers infront of the class. I don't think i did my paper right. What if i sound stupid?  oh well, i am probably not the only one that thinks that. i am not sure if i am going to switch my major becaus psychology is soemthing that i have always wanted to learn. my highschool teacher was soo cool. I loved visiting the LOCNAME LOCNAME hospital. It was so fascinating how those people could actually think those ways and believe everything they feel. I kind of felt sorry for some of them too. I don't know how to feel when it comes to people that are disabled, shoudl I feel sorry or luck to know them? 
__label__label1      I am a little worried about this asignment because I don't type very fast, but I guess this is giving me good practice. I don't know if i should go run before dinner or take the excerisese class that is after dinner. I need to do something because I will get into the pattern of not working out,and then i will gain the freshman 00 like very one says you do. There is just so many other things that i need to be doing. But i know that i feel better if i work out. If i gain weight i will get depresed and i won't want to do anything. I can't believe PROPNAME is so wraped up in working out. i am supposed to be the one worried about my figure. PROPNAME has lost weigh too. How does she stay so motivated, and excited about runing. I would go take that class, but i have never done kick boxing, and i will problay look very stuiped. There are girls that just never shut up in this dorm. And some that always have the perfect hair and make up. That just seems so high school to me. I am excited about the chrisitan soriety. I hope i can find some girls that i like to hang around with. PROPNAME their will be a couple that i will enjoy being around. I hope I enjoy the pledge retreat on Friday. I bet we will be up all night. That means that I will probably be sick again. PROPNAME is coming down on Saterday, and I hope that PROPNAME will come to. PROPNAME has grown up so much in the last couple of months. I can't believe that she is being exposed to all of the PROPNAME trama with Jims affairs. That is just a burden that she should not have to have. I know i think about it all the time and i did not have to listen to it as much as she did. It just amazes me how he could have done that. I wonder if he has some kind of mental problem. It would not surprise me, look at his dad. I just hope PROPNAME is not like his dad. Surley PROPNAME would know if he was. At least i hope she would know, for her sake. I think it is funny how Pam all the sudden likes to cook now. She is in her late fortys and is just now learning how to cook. Thats sad. I am glad that i grew up in a family who cooks, and eats dinner together at night. Or at least we did when we  were little. Not all the time now that everyones off to college. It was so wird going home this weekend, it was almost like i had to get used to it again. It has felt so far away for the past three weeks. I don't want to go home too much. I want mom and dad to get the feeling that Im gone, and so then when i come home it is special. PROPNAME made me mad this weedend, becuause he did not come and visit with my parents. I took time out of my schedule to come and visit his parents. His parents seemed weird this weekend also, i wonder what was up. Page seemed like she was jelouse that they were having to buy PROPNAME some new cloths. That is so rediculous. She is a grown woman that can act like a small child some times. She can be very stingy. I can't believe that Jasons parents don't support him very much, i guess i am just used to having the best dad in the world  
__label__label0 I need to learn better time management skills. I'm so glad that I can finally access all those crazy sites and forums in rhetoric. Oh wow! What's up with that teacher? I do feel sorry for her though. I know what's it like not to be able to do all that technical computer stuff. Afterall, I was only on the computer last night for four hours. And I can't believe I allowed myself to sleep for over an hour and a half this morning! But you know what? I figured out that I can get a lot of work done as long as I do it outside of my dorm room. I also figured out why people say   silence is golden.  (Though personally, I don't mind a little noise every now and then. ) Oh my gosh! I totally found a gift from God today! I was sitting in the study lounge in Jester only to stumble upon a study group for 000k. And it was definitely a blessing to finally get into PROPNAME's class. I can't believe PROPNAME and my new friends are in there. Though the day has seemed slow, that was such a delight. Now I can email PROPNAME or maybe call up PROPNAME. (I talked to PROPNAME today infront of LOCNAME LOCNAME and she's taking 000k too. ) I got the phone numbers of two of the girls in the study group and both said they'd be more than welcome to help me with my 000k homework. The only thing I'm not quite sure if it's a plus or not would be the fact that ORGNAME and Rubes are in this new class as well. I'm not sure if I'm at a stage where I could answer questions as I'm trying to learn them myself. And though it sounds kind of bad, I really need to get an 'A' in 000k. Maybe I can review it this weekend and then I might be able to help them next week. Oh wow, next week! I have tests coming out of nowhere! But today was refreshing considering the fact that I'm actually caught up on almost all of my classes. If I can do that in one day. time management here I come! It's pretty pathetic, the little that make you excited. Well once I'm done with this maybe I'll have a better feeling about the rest of my classes because that's one more assignment down. Oh yeah, uh huh! I kind of wish I was a speed reader. I wonder if I'd actually get to party a lot more. Dude, screw the parties me and PROPNAME are going to build a fort. How cool is that? That's just too cool! Oh yeah, we're going to take the pillows from all our friends and were going to throw blankets over them and   POW   there's your fort. Oh and we're going to watch movies in it too! Oh yeah, people that hear about this one. jealous. 
__label__label1 Does this writing assignment have to be in essay format? This whole electronic assignment is very new to me and I have no clue what i should do! I'm guessing this is kind of a journal type thing. As I'm typing, my fingers are shaking. The whole day has been very nerve wrecking because i feel so stupid in class! College is a completely different world and I honestly don't know how well i will do! Do i have to capitalize my   I's  ? I type much faster if I don't. so many things are going through my mind, like what should i write about? what should i wear to the party tonight? am i even going the party? i wonder if there will be any cute guys there. This 00 minute period is going by very slow. i keep making typing errors because i am trying to type fast, but my hands are shaking! my foot is numb! i am so paranoid! am i even doing this assignment right? im trying not to stop too much, but i keep making errors that i have to go back and fix. why am i shaking? my sister's wedding is on saturday, i wonder if its going to turn out right. she's been taking on all of the responsibilities such as flower arrangements, restaurant decorations, etc. i offered to help, but she declined. oh my goodness! its only been 0 minutes?! what else am i supposed to write? i remember doing something like this in AP Language. PROPNAME made us go outside somewhere and type what we felt or things we observed in nature and relate somehow. i hope this is a similar assignment, if not then i am doing this completely WRONG! im very sleepy because i haven't gotten much sleep since school started, yesterday. i only got four hours of sleep on tuesday night and then seven hours last night. i'm pretty sure im not going to get much sleep over the weekend becasue its my sister's wedding and i have to help as much as possible. im only half way through with the assignment. i think im running out of thoughts. my classes really make me nervous. i felt so stupid in calculus today. i knew all of the questions he asked, but it took me twice as long as everyone else to answer! i don't think i made a very good impression on buskirk either. falling asleep on the first day of school and not following directions correctly the next doesn't actually give the professor a very good first impression. why can't i make friends with people? i don't think im very social unless people talk to me first. i'm getting very sleepy. my eyes are drooping as i type. will i get an incompletion grade for this assignment because i dotn kno if im doing this correctly. i am really taking this assignment seriously! my fingers and knees are shaking, but i think mostly because im so pooped. i miss home a little. i miss not having so many responsibilities like paying bills, college, etc. the professors i have are actually nicer than i expected, but then its also only the second day of school. i don't kno how much high school prepared me for college becasue i don't really know what to expect anymore. all of these online registrations to get your grades, do your homework, etc. is very confusing. i am trying to keep up in every class, but its so hard to becasue the class is so big. every day, i think,   what am i supposed to do now?   i try really hard to make good grades and all, but it doesn't feel like its enough. i think im actually a good student, but im a visual learner. im trying to think of what to say next, but nothing in particular is on my mind. i see things infront of me, but i have no thoughts about it. Britney spears is a great dancer, but she's got a wierd voice. i think the american idol should be kelly clarkson. she's a great singer. i wish i was that talented. i wish i was a genious who was pretty and talented, but instead im more of a moderately intelligent average looking girl who tries too hard. i feel like a loser. time is almost up. i didnt' realize how hard it was to keep track of my thoughts. i think its hard because when im thinking, its just a continuous flow, but when i have to actually pay attention to what im thinking, then i feel forced to think of something. its kind of like when someone asks you to sing. you can sing to yourself anytime, but when you are forced to sing, its like you don't know what to sing and you get nervous. i don't think i wrote much for twenty minutes. i did have to pause a couple of times though so i can remember everything i was thinking. it feels so much easier now, but i still don't kno if i got the assignment right. do you deduct points for punctuation, grammar, capitalization, etc. ? 
__label__label0     I am sitting at my desk and the printer just finished printing the page of the LOCNAME city limits schedule and I am looking forward to going and Galactic tickets aren't on saLE EVENTHOUGH THE AD SYS THEY ARE AND i DO HAVE LOTS OF HOMEWORK TONIGHT SO MAYBE i SHOULDN'T GO TO SEE PROPNAME PROPNAME AT WHERE IS IT AT OH YEAH aNTONES BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY GIRLS GOIN G PROPNAME IS SUCH QA WEIRD GUYBUT HE IS VERY GIVING AND HE WANTS TO GO TO lIVE WHICH IOS FUNNY OW MY ARM IS STARTING TO TIRE SI WILL TYPE A SECOND slower oh shit I accidentally hit the caps lock button i hope that is ok luckilky he is just spot checking, my feet are vbecoming warm and starting to prspire so i think i will take off my sandals. when is my mom going to call me back i need that info, she is always so slow if my cell phone rings i will know becausze my speakers start sending feedback, it is weird i hope punctuattion is important uhhh. my coffee is starting to get water down so i am going to drink it and come to think of it i amthirsty so it works out good. that was good i feel like lighting a candle.

__label__label1      I don't know if I can keep up a   stream of consciousness  , maybe a trickle, but not a stream. Keeping my mind on one thing is kind of difficult these days, but I'm going to give it a shot for the sake of it. I guess, I'll just start rambling, I hate this commercial, PROPNAME is so irritating. I can't stand those   talking animal -up front . spokespeople    Why do they have to do that?  It's got to be degrading to any gecko watching, that awful accent. . ugh. You know what else isn't fair. . asking if the class is hungry. Of course they'll be hungary. That's like saying,   don't wiggle your toes!!!    Won't happen. I know, because I had an algebra teacher in middle school who liked to do things like that. Don't move your toes, can't you feel the sweat in between them?  Or even better: imagine your gym teacher in a bunny suit hopping backward around the track. Bad mental pictures I tell you. That's the problem with an active imagination. Mental pictures galore!  I've got to find the picture for everything, and I mean everything!  Can't get away from any of the mental pictures. I wonder if it's allowed for me to turn off the TV, it's not as much fun when you can't look at it. This background noise is not working for me, I'll type with one hand,truning down volume. . . . . much better. Oh wow, only 0 minutes in. It's like I'm putting myself on the spot here. Purposefully rambling. Doesn't that go against one of the major social filters in place?  A rambler is annoying. This is very difficult because we're trained not to ramble on, and here we are having to skew the system and just   flow  . Ugh, continuing on, today was a good day. They've all been good ones lately. Going back to school after being gone for a year has really made me appreciate the university more. I've had such a renewed optimism lately, which is good because I usually have that cynical person out front for everyone to see. But I guess it's time to try something new and go for the gusto, grab life by the horns, see the light at the end of the tunnel, as it were. It's like the beginning of every semester is a new chance to start over. I like that, and Lord only know that I've been needing a jumping off point for a new start. This is it I guess. And what better way to start anew, than with a stream of consciousness?!?  PROPNAME I'll learn something about myself from this thing. It'll be interesting either way, won't it?  Why is it that you never get an itch until you start doing something that you're not supposed to stop?  Good ol' Uncle PROPNAME. He's been really messing with me today. The bus won't come unless I've lit a cigarette,  I won't get hit up by petitioners until after I've withdrawn money,  all day long it's been this way (wow, that sounded like yoda. Tired, I am)  Nothing like a little Yoda reference to set everything straight. Ok, blank mind, what do I do , la la la la la la la la la la la  What should I have for dinner tonight? I don't want to cook, I'll think of something, and if not cereal is always an option. How about that KIN test tomorrow morning?  I hope I do well on it. Correspondence classes are such a pain if the testing sites aren't convienient.  Why isn't the ORGNAME ORGNAME testing center on campus?  Why does it have to be on LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME?  I don't want to have to go to LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME at 0 in the morning to take a test. It's ridiculous!! What were they thinking?  I guess I'm just ready for something to be easy for once, for things to fall into place. For the past 0 years it's been nothing but aggrevation and frustration and all of the other things that essentially mean the same thing but with many subtle variations. I'm so tired of having to worry about what horrendous thing is coming around the corner. I can deal with the regular things just fine, but the slaps in the face are just GRRRR, I hate 'em, life is not supposed to be so difficult, it's not supposed to be easy, but it has been ridiculous. . though I do think think things are turning around. Time's up, got a cramp in the back of my right hand and, boy is it hot in here!  Time to go. 
__label__label0 Here I go, frist off let me think of a topic, how about looking at a country side in the LOCNAME hill conutry. Useraly the frist thing I notce are the ceder trees, and while I like trees, there is something upsetting about ceder trees; they are not native to this part of the country, however they are well adattined to this climet. Sence ceder trees are evergeens they can feed themselfs all year round, which gives them avantivce over the trees that grow here naturaly, such as oaks and jupaters. Oaks and jupaters lost thier leaves in the fall, and both species of trees grow very slowly; aposed to ceder wich grow very fast. Thus the ceder trees have drowed out most of the oak and other native trees. This is upsetting to me because, while ceder forest is nice to look at, it is no where as impressive as an forest made up of old mujestic oaks and jupaters with there beatifull puple and white blossmues. Another thing about ceder is they grow close together and low to the ground, which makes it very hard to walk around in a ceder woolden area. Just think how great it would be to walk aroud in a forest of huge old oak trees over your head, that pervade shade, while still leting a cool wind througt. Yes, it would cerncely make the rolling hills of the hill conutry more beatuifull, and would surely enhace my beatitude, while walking through the woolds.      
__label__label1      I was fairly apprehensive about beginning this assignment, as it is my first official college homework. I'm a little worried that I won't be able to fill the entire twenty minutes with my thoughts, however I've never had a lack of thought before, never been at a loss of something interesting or intriguing to ponder or speak about. However, I've also never been asked to trace my stream of thought for twenty minutes. Right now I'm feeling pretty tired ORGNAME I guess a little thirsty. But I guess that's life. Life is also a board game by ORGNAME ORGNAME, you know, the one where you buy 'House Insurace'. Life is sitting at my computer completing an assignment for one of my classes. Life can be a many number of things, such as a pony ride in LOCNAME, a state I've been to once to see PROPNAME's birthplace but have no desire to return to. PROPNAME was our 00th president, something I remember from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was the best class I ever took in highschool. I haven't been on a pony ride in years. The girl across the hall from me in my dorm used to train horses though, and she talks of them semi-frequently. My roomate does a lot of studying. I'd say upwards of six or seven hours each day. It makes me feel guilty that I am not always making the best use of my time, but I figure that's what college is about. Not specifically wasting time however, because it in itself is definately not a waste. I'm almost done with classes for the week, just a philosophy discussion section tomorrow from 0-0. It's nice to only have one class on fridays, however I am disappointed that I got assigned that scetion. A 0-day weekend each week would be much appreciated, which I suppose goes without saying. My boyfriend is coming into town this weekend, which is nice. He attends the ORGNAME ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME (ORGNAME ORGNAME). Most people are shocked to dicover that I'm dating an Aggie. I guess I just haven't become a die-hard Longhorn fan, as of yet anyway, although I know I will never sever a relationship (as some people think I most definately should) over school pride and - or rivalry. I will however attend the UT/A&M game and probably wear orange. I will also eat some yogurt and get a lemonade as soon as these four minutes are up. I need to put some more of my photos up in my room. My roommate has put some up. They're small PROPNAME PROPNAME prints, which is my favorite. I'm pretty passionate about art, I did a lot of reading this summer on the history and pecific time periods of western art. However, my roommate just put them up for their aesthetic value. Oh well, you can't win them all. Most though, anyway.      
__label__label0      Right now i am in my dorm room recovering from classes and preparing for an evening filled mostly with studying. My ears are receiving the wonderful sounds of PROPNAME PROPNAME, Jackopierce & PROPNAME PROPNAME, and also PROPNAME PROPNAME ( a Camp Allen classic). I can not say that i am smelling anything particularly because my sinuses are acting up after a game of soccer last night. I guess there is just something about the grass down by the ORGNAME fountains that fires up my histamines.         I am feeling a little anxious and stressed right now. I woke up at 00:00 this morning just as my first class was starting. This class is small and very much attendance based, so i could not simply skip it. I had to rush out the door and i believe that this rush has caused me to feel as though in race all day. The stress comes from the inability to finish a project for that class as a result of my oversleeping. I know the professor was not proud and i am afraid my grade will suffer as a result. I want to keep my grades up so that i will be able to easily transfer to any school because right now i do not believe that i will be able to cut it for 0 years in architecture school. For now i am committed to finishing this semester and evaluating things from there.         My mind just wandered back to Psychology class today. Dr. PROPNAME really angered me when he suggested that one of the greatest christians of all time and that spirituality and religion are all frauds and conjured up by our temporal lobes. He said that PROPNAME saw a vision of Christ after he fell on the road to damascus because he probably hit or damaged his temporal lobe. Well PROPNAME saw a blinding light that caused him to fall and afterward he was blind, which would not be caused by damage to the temporal lobe. Furthermore, other people had received visions of what was to happen and to receive PROPNAME into their homes as a result of the events. There i've said my piece.         I just realized that the music i'm listening to makes me miss my friends. One is called   Please Come to LOCNAME   and it talks about trying get together with old friends as this person is moving on with their own life. It has the same effect on me. I want my friends to come visit me on campus, but for some reason it would feel like a step back for me to go visit them. The other song is one from the christian summer camp i worked at for the past three summers. it just takes me back there with all of my friends and the summer love. We still talk occasionally, but only over the internet and not on the phone. I really prefer talking face to face if at all possible and then the phone and lastly the internet. It just seems so impersonal to talk on the internet with instant messages. Plus you can not fully express yourself; sarcasm for example is hard to decipher when written.         Wow, i actually wrote for twenty minutes and enjoyed it. this was actually a little therapeutic to express myself like this. 
__label__label1      Well. I just finished my first week of college. I can't believe I'm already here, but I wish I was already out. There seems like so much to do but I'm starting to get things under control. I think. My friend PROPNAME is at ORGNAME and shes going to jump for the track team. She is an emblem of success. everytime I think of her, it reminds me of just how bad of a person I am. I guess everyone makes mistakes, but my mistakes seem to be a lot worse when I make them, because I know better. Hopefully  I can keep up with all my reading assignments. reading is definitely not my thing. especially when I'm forced to do it. Tomorrow's reading time will be flled with the SI class, but that's okay I think I'm going to need as much help as I can get. Tonite's church. thank the Lord. Sometimes you just got to get filled up when everything seems so dry. I love church, but sometimes I feel so . . I don't know. not as good as everyone else. like nobody makes mistakes but me. I know that's not true. only I lie from the devil trying to get me down. anyways today in psychology class someone mentioned obessive cumplusive disorders. and I wanted to scream out. I've been caught in that trap beofre. Which I have and thank the Lord I no longer am bound by that chain. only by the grace of God did I get through some of the worst, tearful, confusing years of my life. Oh. El Patio sounds real good right now. not only because of the delicious food, but because I have to right a paper on it and I need to get some intricate details to make my paper a success! I can't wait to be home tonite. I've been up at school since before 0 am. only to realize that my 0 am class had been canceled. my next class was not until 00 noon. Oh well at least I got some studying in and I was able to finish my english homework so that I wouldn't have any tonite. Praise the Lord. Anyways back tonite. my boyfriend is suppose to call me about ten. man I hope he gets his own phone soon. I miss him. I wish could just get married right now. but my father might have other plans for that situation. . but I don't understand sometimes. why do you always have to wait 'til your outa school before you get married. . of course I understand the logical part of it all, but what about love. although love is suppose to be patient. I don't like preaching to myself all the time. it's like I know what's right but I wish things could be different. I don't know. right now my biggest concern is my dad letting me drive down to LOCNAME LOCNAME and pick up PROPNAME (my boyfriend) on friday afteroon. oh Lord please help me to find favor with him on this situation. Wow. twenty minutes is a lot longer than I thought it was going to be. It's like writing in my journal on the computer. what Dr. PROPNAME said today about when your depressed, to write what your feeling down. I totally agree. I know no matter what I'm feeling it always helps to write in my journal and shed a few tears of course! I like journals soo much that lately, I've been giving them to my friends for their birthdays. my time is clicking down. I really hope I can find a job soon and hopefully my friend PROPNAME found one today. 
__label__label0 Okay, here we go. This should be fun. I just got done eating. I spent 0 dollars on lunch. I am whittling away at my alloted 0000 dollar food stockpile. Anyway, i don't think that will last the whole year. Maybe one semester at the most. Anyway, my classes are all over today except for BA000, but that class is more of a joke. I was playing football last night and i jammed my right ring finger and it is extremely swollen right now. It feels like i need to pop it but it hurts too much for that. I also stubbed my big toe and bent the nail back about one third of the way. If you've never done that before, i fully recommend it. It feels wonderful. I should be taking a nap. Thats how I like to pass time. When i start reading, I usually end up falling asleep anyway. I have my first test of the year on tuesday. Its a microeconomics test. I seem to have a good understanding of economics so far. Maybe thats because I took it last year at my local community college. I was learning it pretty well until my teacher died midway through the semester. After that I learned nothing and my entire grade was based on a paper i wrote about rising gas prices for the summer. My finger is throbbing somewhat. I don't think I broke it, its just really swollen. I wish I could get a go-kart or something to drive to class. All this walking and such is tedious. I really should catch up with my reading. I have 0 classes that I need to read for regularly, and i am falling behind. I liked the weather yesterday. There was a grey sky, and it was rainy all day. I used to live in LOCNAME, so I am used to rain. Its fun when it rains a lot, and you jsut have to stay in all day. Its not so much fun when it rains a lot, and it starts to flood. Wow, 00 minutes seems like a long time. Of course, if i weren't doing this, i probably would be sleeping. 00 minutes of sleep is nothing. Thats for amateurs. I go for hour increments. I withdrew $00 from an ATM last weekend and i don't really know where i spent it all because i only have 0 left. I didnt buy that much stuff i don't think. Oh well, its only money (right. ) I am looking forward to ORGNAME's next football game. The one against LOCNAME LOCNAME was crazy. People act so mob-like at those games. Everyone wears orange, everyone yells the same things. It almost like we've been brainwashed. Thats what TV does. Without us realizing, it plants little idioms and messages in our head. And another thing thats funny is how the least contributing people to our society are held the highest. For example, athletes, entertainers. etc. There roles in our world are purely excessive yet they control the wealth and are looked up to as if they are supreme. One thing i think is stupid is when people ask the famed for autographs. They are just normal people! Would you ask me for an autograph if you saw me walking down the street? Thats doubtfull. But when PROPNAME from LOCNAME LOCNAME is seen in LOCNAME LOCNAME, surely people recognize him and ask him for autographs. People find solace in the stupidest things. I have ventured away from talking about how much time I have left and began venting. Now time is almost up. 00 seconds left. . 0 okay time is up and my stream of consciousness is beginning to fade. My bed is calling to me. 
__label__label1 I just got out of rugby practice. this is the first practice we have had with the veteran players. my body hurts and for some reason I can't sleep so i decided to do this. im too excited to do anything, but think about the next practice. it reminds me of playing soccer in highschool. we should have won state my sophomore year. we had the most talented team i had ever seen at that level. two of the players from that year actually play in the mls. I love rugby. I was never a very imposing guy until about my junior year of highschool and by that time it was too late to play football. so i kept playing soccer. but i've always wanted to just level the other team, and now I can do that. I missed biology this morning because is et my alarm for 0:00 pm instead of 0:00 am. I hate when i do things like that. I miss summer school at LOCNAME. It was so much more fun than the fall. Everyone hung out together, and we could all get in to any party no matter if we were rushing or not. Now I'm lucky if I see one of the people from summer just once a week. Fall was suppose to be better. A girl that was my best friend in highschool, and I am absolutely in love with is here now. we have been here about two and a half weeks and we have only spent time together once. All she cares about is her sorority. And when we did hang out all she did was talk about how she was   tired of dealing with it.   Why doesn't she quit?  What is her obsession with being a part of something?  I just wish that we were growing closer like we thought we would in college. Instead we are moving further and further apart. Every guy she meets ends up asking her out on a date. She always some how avoids it, and I don't know why. Suddenly, a guy with plans for a very successful career seems much more attarctive than just a regular guy that wants to have fun and hang out. I can't believe i just wrote that because I am one of those guys with plans for a successful career. Maybe thats not what she is looking for at all. She lives seven floors below me but instead of coming up to say hi, she just calls. We talk two or three times a day, and when we see eachother we always give eachother subtle compliments. She is the one person who can always make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I'm in. I guess thats what being best friends for five years will do to you. I never knew I thought about her as much as I do. I think I'll go and see 
__label__label0   There is to much traffic in austin. I am ready to see my girlfriend this weekend. I am glad it is almost the weekend. The buses outside are to loud it is annoying. I guess it is really annoying when someone srives by with loud music in the middle of the night or rotc marches by. I'm thirsty I think I will get so water. I like this deja blue container it works good to refill. On yea that nice and cold. I guess I need to study my spanish when I am done with this. I wonder how my parents are doing, I guess I should call them pretty soon. Five min. and twenty seconds this is going by pretty fast. Tomorrow is friday horray. I am not really sure if that is how horray is spelled. It probaly isn't in the dictionary. There are always car alarms going off if someones car acutually gets robbed no one will know whose it is. That would suck. I like my bob marley poster it is interesting. I guess I should go work out a little today before work. I'll bet work is really boring tonight unless there are a lot of people at the fields. who know. That water tastes good. This psychology is kind of interesting but I still don't know what I am going to major in. It really does bug me I wish I could figure it out. Oh well mabye it will just hit me one day mabye I should just have fun. I need a different soap I don't really like this dail. I wish I wouldn't of bought a big ass bottle of it. It will take forever for me to use it. I wonder whats on tv. It would be kind of hard to watch will I am typing. I want hook up my speakers to my computer, I need to find that damn chord. I need to find someone with a printer for biology homework. What am I going to do when I am done with this I don't know if I really want to study. I guess I have to since I have to work tonight. Wow it is eighty degrees in here. I wonder how acurrate that galelio theremometer is. It seems like it would be pretty acurrate. galelio was a smart guy so why not. looks hot outside im glad I don't have to go out there till later. although it still won't be all that cool.   
__label__label0 I wish polygamy was still legal. Well, not polygamy, but i wish i could take more than one girl to texas OU weekend.  i have like 0 or 0 girls that i would enjoy taking,k and who are all expecting me to take them, but no matter what i do, i am going to piss like 0 girls off. It kind of sucks. I am glad that i can at least take one date, but it is a complicated matter when it comes to toying with peoples, especially girl's emotions. I think i have pretty much decided on who i am going to ask, but i heard that she has a boyfriend, so im not sure about it any more. While this kind of makes me angry, i guess it helps me out in deciding who i am going to ask. I don't even know, there is a girl who lives down the hall from me, and is actually in this class. I am sure it will all work out anyway.    I guess when it comes down to it i am lucky to even be here. ( at LOCNAME ). A subject that occupies my mind a lot of the time is what happened to me this summer. Basically i went out to fraternity rush party, had way to much to drink. I wish to God someone had been there to take away my keys, but no one was, and i got in my car, drove the wrong way and ended up putting my car into a lake. When i say putting, i mean a 00mph plunge down a boat ramp. I realize that i have almost died and i have spent many hours dwelling on what happend, what could have happened, and thank God, where i am now. The only real problem is how i live now. Any other person would have sworn off drinking for good, but i continue to do it, even though i told my parents i wouldn't. This makes me feel guilty, and upset. I don't really know what im going to do about the whole situation, but i am determined to make my parents realize that i am as responsible as ever, and not to disappoint them.   I miss my dog like crazy, which is weird, cause i don't really miss my parents that much. I guess its because i can talk to my parents, but i can't call my dog and see how hes doing. I wish i could have my dog here with me, cause he really is my best friend. I love dogs, they never smart off to you, and they don't stay mad at you.     I love college life, fraternity life, and everything else, i just hope that i don't get too bogged down with partying, and stuff, that ill be to busy to study and do well.               
__label__label1 I have been extremely pissed off for the entire day. I have just started classes again at LOCNAME. I am trying to get into the pharmacy school. I work at a pharmacy now, but the people there are driving me insane. I have panic disorder, but lately instead of panicking I am just angry. I almost ran into about 0 cars driving on mo-pac. road rage?!  My therapist is trying to assure me that I am not the one who is crazy - it's just the people around me. My job, my parents, my friends". I am taking things out on PROPNAME who does not deserve it - he is just here all the time. I wrote him a nasty email and I think he just replied. He is so sweet, I really should make a HUGE effort not to do that to him. he is probably used to it after 0 years. yuck. I would have been tired of my temper tantrums a long time ago. I tried acupuncture today for anxiety and my irritable bowel syndrome. The guy treating me at the student clinic was a moron. I usually get good people. he is graduating soon from that academy and I am scared of what he will do to his patients. I am going to take a xanax now and see how long it takes me to calm down. Cool, I can time it. ready, go. ok. I have to work all weekend when I need to be studying. my wrist hurts. maybe from typing, maybe from that moron. this should be pretty interesting for someone to read. I have lots of other homework that I could be doing, but this is all I have the brain power for right now. no offense, but it's not biochemistry. I am glad to be back in school. I hit the wrong key and it stopped for like 0 seconds. weird. I have to work with john the head pharmacist this weekend. they are all trying to manipulate me into working more hours than I want to. they have now told me that if I don't work all of these hours that they will find someone else to work there. it's all or nothing. I know they are bluffing, because it would take them so long to train someone that one of the other techs that works at the store would have to cover the weekends for months. no one wants to work weekends. so I should do it because I'm in school and that's easier for me because I am a student. that's their logic. that's crap. I think I'm almost done bitching. I am going to work tomorrow and if he doesn't make some compromise with me then I may just walk out and let him work by himself. that won't happen. he will say anything to keep me there. and I'll probably fall for it and think everything is ok and then he will just change his mind at the end of the weekend. so, I should just change jobs, or just change stores. ORGNAME's sucks - they all have their heads up their butts. AAAAH! I guess I feel a little better now, but not much. I will just have to think about something else if I am going to feel better. my glasses are foggy. they always get scratched because I don't take care of them. I need an eye exam. haven't had one since grade school. who says grade school? I'm old. I have to be good this weekend. even though I am going to a birthday party that will probably be not quite as good as I need to be. whatever, that didn't make sense. I wonder when john will be home. at least I'm getting something done. I need to do a lot of things. I need to send transcripts to ORGNAME, start looking at pharm apps. and ask john if he is really going to move with me if I go out of state. I will probably get in for next fall but you never can tell. I applied way too late last year and got stuck on the stupid alternate list. ok, next/      
__label__label0 I wonder when my sister is going to be back from her meeting?  I am getting a little hungry. PROPNAME's fan is so loud, and it is making the room so cold. I think I should turn if off in a second. It smells like chocolate in here which is making me even more hungry. I miss my cousin PROPNAME so much being three hours away is too far. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. He probably has football practice. I hope we win the football game this weekend. That reminds me, last weekend was so crazy I don't think I am ever going to drive someone else's car again. Gee that was an adventure though. I think I should wash clothes later because the pile is getting pretty high. Why does my phone light keep turning off and on? I really need to get a new one already. I hope my friend likes the birthday present I bought him. Everyone deserves a great present on their twentieth birthday! That new cd that I bought is great I actually feel like listening to it right now. Oh great I have calculus homework. That stuff is so confusing. It was just yesterday when I was talking to PROPNAME and he was saying he is having a hard time in his class over at Tech. He said, I wonder what I got myself into. " And I began wondering that myself. Okay what was that cow noise that I just heard from my sisters computer? That thing is always making the weirdest sounds. My sister is so smart; I wish things came to me as easy as they come to her. But what do I know I'm just the middle child. My brother and sister are always saying I have "middle child syndrome," but what is that anyway. I wonder if my dad is out of work already. He always has a busy work load. Man I never realized how many sacrifices he has really made for our family. I mean considering he is the only working parent and he has two children in college. Wow my dad is really smart too. And what do you know my dad and sis are alike in so many ways. I wish Tabby would come and visit us. I think it would be even better if she came to college up here too instead of back home. I am really attached to her. I mean we have spent almost everyday of our lives together and now I barely even get to see her on the weekends, and with college, it makes it even harder to keep in touch. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing at ORGNAME. I bet she is having a ball. That is her dream college and I can't wait to hear the stories at Christmas. I wonder if my mom is making dinner back at home right now. Mmm I can almost smell it all the way over here. I am still hungry maybe I should go downstairs to get something to eat. 
__label__label0 I am thinking back to when in class you were talking about sitting in front of the computer and wondering what to write about. I wonder what my roommate is saying ?hmmm? for. she may think it is weird that I am writing about her if she reads this. I like rice krispie treats. I just had one. I went to the vegas getaway for the business school; it was fun. my face is itching. my nose, then my neck. I really like what I've done with my hair today, but too bad it took longer than I had expected it to take. my roommate, erika, is leaving. she is going to go get something to eat. now my back is itching. I wonder why, when you itch, simply rubbing on the itching spot doesn't make the itch go away. you have to scratch it instead. wouldn't it be easier if we just didn't itch at all? I mean, what's the point of itching anyway? I guess it just makes the experience of life all the more interesting. also why is it that when you start to itch, you suddenly itch everywhere. kind of like when someone yawns and you see it, it makes you have to yawn too, even if you're not sleepy. I'm spending an awful lot of time thinking about itching. I want to take a speed reading class at the ORGNAME. maybe it will help me in the future. but will I begin to speed-read everything if I take the course?. I like listening to music. I guess most people do really. my nose itches again. I'm glad it got cooler in this dorm room. last week it was SO hot. I had to sleep on top of my blanket. the good thing is that it therefore provided more padding on these rock-hard beds. I really like the movie LOCNAME. it's so theatrical. speaking of which, I think my sister had auditions for the high school's fall play today. I wonder how she thinks she did. I hope that she gets a part, even if it's a small one. I'm looking forward to seeing the fall production. maybe they'll make it to state ORGNAME this year. I miss being in theatre. I would like to join a theatre club, but I'm not sure I have time for the rehearsal commitment. plays are a lot of work. I really like this writing assignment you all have devised for us. it's interesting and even kind of fun. I like the box I have on my shelf. it's orange and gold, with a leaf pattern. thank goodness I only have 0 classes tomorrow. today was nonstop; 0 classes with only a 00 minute break. I had a bagel for breakfast. I wonder how early the bagel guy has to get up in order to go to his little stand and be open in time for 0 o'clock classes. I wonder if he likes his job?. he would get to meet and see a lot of people every day; that, I'm sure, is a perk or he would not be living in LOCNAME, or any big city. I'm from a small town. austin still continues to wow me with the massive number of people on campus and on the streets. oh good I get to put my pennant that I bought today up on my board in about 0 minutes. it cost $0. one about 0/0 of the size cost $0. they're probably betting on the idea that people will not check the price of both pennants and simply buy the smaller one, thinking it will cost much less. I had economics today. I think I'm beginning already to think more about the economy. at least I hope so, because if I am, that means I'll do better on the tests. there is a study session tomorrow night that I'll be attending. I need to go running later. I'm really glad that the gym is so close by. in my hometown, you had to drive 00-00 minutes just to get to a gym. so it was either waste all that time, or go run on the hard, uneven, gravel-y, county road. gravel-y is not a word but that's okay. I wonder what psychological experiences you all will get by reading these assignments. 0 seconds left. oh okay my time is up but I get to finish my thought. I'm going to go study now. I have to read my psych book for your class tomorrow. 
__label__label1 Okay I am really clueless right now on what I am supposed to be doing. I'm pretty sure we're just supposed to write whatever is on our mind, but I've never had an assignment like this one so that seems really peculiar to me. My back kinda hurts, does that count?  Plus I'm wearing Christmas socks, they are white with red and green snowflakes, but I like them. Now I feel weird, like maybe I'm not doing the assignment right, I don't know what to put. I'm the type of person that always likes to have clear directions on what to do. Someone tells me to do something, and I do it. That way I know that what I'm doing is right. But oh well. I've missed two calculus classes in a row, and that is got me worried. I'm really aiming for a 0. 0. People would make ORGNAME as a school that is completely hard, and all u do is work. And that's partly true, I always find myself reading, and it takes me a full day to finish a math assignment. The weird thing is that I would never read in high school, so I thought it would be a major drag. Surprisingly it's not. I don't think it's that bad. Last night I was reading for economics, but I was too sleepy and nothing I was reading was sinking in. I set my alarm clock for 0:00, but it didn't go off so I missed calculus. That is got me worried. But I'm pretty sure that I'll do okay. Now I have 0 minutes and 00 seconds writing, still not too sure what I'm doing, still having my doubts. I think of so many things when I'm by myself, I go into my own little world and just think about anything and everything. But when I'm asked what I'm thinking, I go completely blank. And people think that I'm just holding things from them, that I'm keeping to myself. Maybe that's partly true, but I really do go blank a lot of times. My memory is really weird. I can remember the smallest most insignificant details about something, and then not remember something important that occurred. Okay I just noticed that when I started writing, I was sitting up straight. Now I am completely slouching, and now my back hurts. I don't know why I said that my back was hurting earlier, it really wasn't. Perhaps it was just because I had nothing to say. But now it really does hurt. I have back problems, last time I got an x-ray it showed that it was 00 or 00 degrees crooked. I don't remember which one it was. and that was a long time ago. I really should go again. Which reminds me, I need to go to a dentist too. I have not gone to a dentist in about 0 or 0 years. My parents go, but my sister and I have not gone. They told us to get the dental health plan here at LOCNAME. Do they even have that? I'm pretty sure they do, I'm just procrastinating. I'm not too consistent on my thoughts or actions. I give in really easily to things I wish I wouldn't. Oh well I'm sure I'm not the only one. Now 00 minutes and 00 seconds have gone by. A few more to write whatever it is that I'm thinking. And I went blank again. Well I started to notice my back again, so I decided to sit up straight. I want to go do laps in the swimming pool. I used to be in swimming when I was little, I was pretty good. I remember that I had a swim meet on my birthday, and I wasn't too happy about that. I hated competition. I hated going to swimming classes, to brownies, jazz dance, and especially karate. Tennis too. Its weird how when ur little, you hate going to all of these things that ur parents make u go to, but when ur older, u whish u would have stuck with them. I was also in gymnastics, but I think I kinda liked that. I remember the first time I had a swimming lesson, I was afraid to get in a pool, so my mom pushed me in. I have class in like 00 minutes, but its in this same building and hey, for this class as a matter of fact. Pretty damn convenient right?  Well now I've taken care of this assignment, I still need to read like 0 chapters for this class and another one for eco. But I don't even know what we're supposed to read. People told me the first 0 chapters, so I guess that is it. Anyways I'm done.

__label__label1 My roommate and I have Office Space" on. What a great movie. It cracks me up every time I watch it. I really like my roommate. She is such a cool girl. It's weird how things work out. I was really scared about having a potluck roommate. Every day we find new things that we have the same. We have the same toothbrush, hairbrush, hair straightener, contact case, pair of pajama pants, caboodle for our makeup, pair of shoes. It's crazy. I really like living at ORGNAME. The food was really good tonight. We had this thing called "mexican shrimp" except it really didn't taste like mexican. It was just little shrimp in this sauce with red and green peppers over rice. Food is so good. I bought some Little Debbie Star Crunch and some ORGNAME ORGNAME at the store today. Little kids snacks are so much fun. I wanted some fruit snacks but they cost too much. PROPNAME (my roommate) and I are not having a good experience with fridges. Our first one leaked all over the carpet so we bought a new one but it gets extremely cold and halfway freezes our stuff. This morning I got out a Dr Pepper and it was all icy. We should read the manual and fix that. I'm excited that I am going home tomorrow for the weekend. I miss my family, especially my sister. This past year we were closer than we had ever been and then I had to leave. I don't have class on Fri so I am going home to see her cheer at the LOCNAME football game tomorrow night. I'm so proud of her. She is so cute and nice and always succeeds at the things she does. I also want to see my puppies. They are the cutest dogs ever and I haven't seen them for 0 weeks. I am also ready to sleep in my own bed. Although my dorm bed is comfortable, it isn't the same. Hahah- gosh I love Office Space. The characters are so messed up and hilarious. I don't know why we have the TV on. I am doing the writing assignment at my computer and my roommate is doing pretesting on her computer and we are both just listening to the TV. I really should go to bed sometime soon because I have an 0am class tomorrow. It was easy for me to get up for high school at 0:00 last year but for some reason I am having a lot of trouble getting up for my classes. I guess I am still in summer mode. Now the credits are rolling on the TV and neither of us is getting up to turn it off. I shouldn't leave instant messenger up when I am doing homework. My friends keep talking to me but I am doing this so I can't talk to them so the boxes just keep flashing at the bottom of the screen and it is really driving me crazy. The music on the credits is also driving me crazy. There is just so much rap music I can take. Oh man! Barenaked Ladies is coming out with a new CD and they are coming on tour to PROPNAME and I am so excited. I love their music so much. I do hope their new album is good because each new one seems to be more pop-ish than the last one. I love their old cd's when they were just in LOCNAME and hadn't crossed over to LOCNAME yet. Their concerts are awesome and I will be going to the one here. I should probably start saving my money. I guess that means I should get a new job. All I know is that I will never work in food again. I worked at Sonic for 0 years and it drove me crazy. I would come home smelling like grease and who knows what else. Yeah, those I'M boxes need to stop flashing. This is one of the most random assignments I have ever done. I probably sound like an idiot with everything I am saying. I really do like my dorm room. It is so colorful and we have so many pictures and posters up. I can't stand blank white walls. The walls in my room at home are blue so being here with white walls is annoying. I should really put some lotion on my legs because they are itchy. The only problem is that I hate lotion. That is my weird thing. Lotion and feet. Put the 0 together and it is an even worse thing. My sister makes fun of me but I make fun of her because she doesn't like anything touching her bellybutton. She won't even touch her bellybutton. Now our room is completely silent except for the clicking of keyboards. I feel like we need some music or something. I'm glad that meghan and I have similar tastes in musics because I wouldn't want to annoy her with something she didn't like. It's been hard finding a radio stations I like here in LOCNAME because I don't really know which station play what kind of music yet. I guess I have plenty of time to learn. Well- my time is up!   
__label__label1 Ok well here I am sitting in my dorm room trying to finish this assignment. Earlier today I had called the student financial aid services because all of my financial aid hasn't come through yet. But now they said it should be getting here anytime soon. And one more thing I still need to do is go get a book for my government class because earlier in the week, they had said that it had been ordered although it wasn't there yet. So I'm probably going to have to go later on today. Then my roommate is going to the football game tomorrow morning. I still don't have a sports package and I didn't buy a ticket so this time I won't be seeing the game. I have a paper due for government on monday concerning my political views and where I come from and who or what has influenced me to think that way. I'm still unsure as to what exactly I will be saying. I just have a couple of ideas written down in a piece of paper. Oh man, yesterday some friends and I went to go work out and for some reason my legs are kind of sore right now. We're probably going again today, but who knows. I'm starting to get a little hungry now, I ate breakfast this morning but I'm getting hungry again. Oh I almost forgot, today is my friend's birthday, I need to call him after I finish this assignment. He is back at my hometown, LOCNAME LOCNAME, but I'm still calling him to wish him a happy birthday. For some strange reason our room always gets real cold. And then our neighbors have the little thing to control the air conditioner but supposedly they can't move it unless we fill in some sort of request. And then other people down the hall complain that it's too hot in their room. I don't know but whatever. My board here in the room looks kinda plain right now. I was initially going to put up some posters a while back, but I ended up doing other stuff and then I would get lazy, so till now the board still looks bare. All I have is one poster on one of the walls here to my right. And then the curtains we put up kept falling at the beginning but we finally got them to stay. All I need now is to actually get the other pictures I wanted to put up already. Oh and then there's my calendar on the wall too, but that's about it. I'm definitely going to finish that this weekend. Last night our neighbors were making a lot of noise and I just couldn't fall asleep. Soon enough I did though. And then I had to wake up early because I have an eight o' clock class, but I managed to do it. So now I'm just here waiting for my roommate to get back from work because we need to go to the store and I need to get a book. Then she said she wanted to buy some jersey for the game on saturday. While I'll be sleeping in, she will be at the game. she can later tell me how the game went, because last time it was raining, hopefully it won't rain again. Now I'm a bit thirsty, I think I'm going to go get myself something to drink from downstairs. Ok that was all for my 00 minutes. finished. 
__label__label1 I am thinking about why exactly I am writing this. I am thinking about how each of my fingers move to touch the keys. PROPNAME is on and it is starting to distract me. I really should pay attention to the writing but the sound of the people speaking is distracting me. The show is talking about feminism, which brings up an interesting point. I really don't like women who are amazingly feministic. I just forgot what my next thought was. Oh well, I feel kinda of hungry. Maybe I should get something to eat. But instead I have this laptop sitting on me while I try to type my steam of consciousness. Speaking of stream of consciousness, which I spelled wrong above. The stream of consciousness is something that I read in the textbook. Some doctor of psychology came up with this idea that monitoring the stream of consciousness will lead to people understanding more about themselves. PROPNAME just made a joke and it is funny. But as I was thinking or writing which ever one your prerogative chooses. Before I digress, or maybe I will or maybe I won't. Now that I choose to reflect on my day I realize that I didn't get that much accomplished, but there is still a lot of the day left. I am really not sure where I am going from here. There was just a commercial about the aggie came against utah. boy I sure do love hi I just answered my phone and it is PROPNAME my friend she is also in psychology. we are talking about this assignment. she is walking back from the dobie center. I am supposed to meet her and her friend PROPNAME. I am going to play PROPNAME in football on the video game. Boy I really like football. Like I was saying I love football and I can't wait till the game against LOCNAME. Boy that is sure going to be a good game. I just happened to notice that I only have six minutes left to write. I really like this assignment it is really fun. My hands are getting tired of typing and I just thought back to when professor said that someone put in instructions to a vcr that is definitely funny. I really don't like Roseanne but somehow she is getting my attention. I am really trying to concentrate on what I am thinking but I believe that is the reason it is hard for me to write more, because I am thinking so hard. My computer fan just turned on and that means it is starting to get hot. But in here it is actually cool. Speaking of my dorm room, I really like it. Well my 00 minutes is up but I am just going to finish writing this last line right here. 
__label__label0 Ok so here I am sitting here writing what I am thinking. crap forgot to look at the clock. ook 0:00. kinda took me a while. analog clocks. hey what did the digital clock say to the analog clock?  look ma, no hands!  yea that is pretty lame but it just popped into my mind. hah I almost wrote pooped into my mind. that would been shitty. does anyone care if I write curse words?  because I think in curse words all the time. dammit my eye itches. alrighty that is a little better ok I'm still just writing not really thinking about what I'm writing or at least trying not too because I keep making all kinds of spelling errors. I can type fairly fast but when I do its fairly shitty. I keep making mistakes and having to go back and erase my mistakes so it kinda takes away from my train of thought. or stream of consciousness (sp?) as u call it. I'm not really a psychologist type person. I'm only taking this class because it sounded like the least boring of the 00 or so choices I had. plus I could tell my friends why they are so stupid. or, well, that was my original plan. I don't know now, but it still seems fairly interesting. I'm not trying to kiss ass there like I sometimes do, and am fairly good at by the way, I really think its interesting, for them most part. like the lie detector test. I found out how to beat on of those things. just lie a lot, then tell the truth occasionally and switch it up enough that it confuses the shit outta the machine. and also make sure that the investigator person does not know whether your lying or telling the truth, you know kinda play stupid. lie when you don't need to. tell the truth but make it sound like a lie. convince yourself its a lie even though you know its the truth. heh my foot itches. reminds me of that time in class you were talking about this assignment. whenever you mention this stream of consciousness writing my foot always itches because you had that stupid itch comment. it was not really stupid just annoying and it bugs me and it was annoying. and it still is. hey my typing has gotten somewhat better of the the last few minutes probably because I'm not concentration so much of fixing my mistakes. so you'll just have to live with all my shitty typos so there ha!  yoo can't stop me because you just said write what on your mind and what if there are a lot of rtypes in my mind?  hihn?  huh?  what u going to do about that?  this charis too low. there we go that is better but now it won't rock. htere fixed that too ok now this is linda wierd because my legds are pusing against the bottom of the desk which sucks because/ I can't lean bakc as much. and my wrists are stargting to get tired because they have nothing to lean on. I have no where for mu wrists theya re ruined! damn my desk for now havign a wrist rest. ok this chari is too high now. and mt arpmits are sweating and I have no idea why. thta happens a lot and I hate it. it makes me look like a nervous fool evcen if I am. ok chair lowered back to where it origicnlly was ok now I'm not even looking at the words I type I'm just staring at my fingers as they type the words and not relallyt thinking about what I'm typeing that sit be interesting to see wat kinda crasyt shit comes of out omy  head I know what kind of mistakes I'm makeing but I'm trying tnot tot chrorect thim and now I'm tryinf nor ro ecen hink just let my ifngers flow and let them do the talkjing not me oand now my eytes are closed that is not workingbla bla bla bla bla I'm still writing now how do u like that?  ur not even going to read therse are you?  I just know it your just doing this for some reason that no one knows yeet but it will be so obvious after u explain it that everyone or at least me will fdeel stupid. u know kinda like that lie detector tesxzt. if u had explained it before then it wouldnt have worked. if I knew how a lie detector test worked then it wouldnt really be that hard to beat. and since u said that they're so accurate, that is making us think that they work all the time so then if we ever get convicted of a crime, or at least on trieal then we'll think that the lie detector works and we won't be able to fool it but then you told ous how it worked and so now we know that is it is not har as accurate as u originally tol us that it would be ok maybe I should just randomyl type letters and see what comes out I'm fsitting here typeing words onto my computer screen and I really doint beel like isttint here typing words I really want to be sleeping of playing counterstaiek or fucking my girldfirend. ytes that last one idont know wny trs last but that sounds really good right now, don't u think. /  but you have a wife I'm sure that uve been doing for a long time so it kinda lost its spart me and meagan have been together 0 years and have been fucking for one yea she thot that she would wait till he was married but yea that is just jddidnt turn out and its not like I forced her we just did it one day without really thinking about it and it was good and I'm getting a little hard now just thinking aobut it myabe I shouldnt be tell ing u this shit but hey u asked its ur own fault if u don't like what I'm witing mmm yea that sex sessions sounds really gfood right now I wish she was here. shed kinda bubm tho so she is goin to acc but hopefully she will be smart enough to transger to a good skoo like ut next year and we can get an appartment together and fuck all the fuck we want. that wousld be fun I would like that. come home after a long day of school to come in my woman  yea, tat would be nice. are you still following me?  hey my roommate just walked in es in his air force unouiform hold on I'm going to explain to him what I'm doing ok no I'm not he didn't ask so he problably does not carel;  ill assume he does not care. aww I stopped thinking about meagan and my erection went away now I see what u mean about how himans can just think about a ember of the opposite sex ad get ariysed but then they can be in the same room as them an not be. let me tell u that does not happen that often. the second one that is. us being together and me not wanting to jumop on her. unless we;kre fighting or my friends are around. either of those. ok my roommate is talking on the phone and its kinda distracting me ookk he is done now well I think its beed 00 minutes I just looked at my watch and yteal I think tis 00 minutes, 0:00  ok cya in class oink 
__label__label0 it is cold in my room the room is the freezing rain which chills my typing hands numbly I feel all of this through skin of course the skiing is always on top of the muscles but the muscle are in the yurget zone of the world I know that the skin is there but it must be cold roommate types next to me like a fearlees wombat that he is I must crack him open and fry him up like an egg an egg of a tale of this land which I live in is the way to a free market economy an economy which the uzbeks can have a say in their government because karimov allow them vote in private elected parties in the spindletop texas cynthia harrington went to that and saw the president president george bush sr was there and he was wearing a green rain coat a coat which I saw on the picture which was on their refrigerator door I knew that it was there because I saw it there next to the pills that their daughter constantly took she was addicted and I tried to stop her but she was depressed and I tried but you can't always help others that don't want to be helped especially those of the race of the unwilling the unwilling whose bones shall be used to pave the way to valhalla which is the greater good of the viking society which I will use to fight off the endless hordes in my brain the viking are outnumbering in my spaceship which I use the toothpaste goo food I eat it and shoot out transformer feces into my face of the po po man I will see the super lucky cat on the last date that I went on in beaumont it will be here that I go and see everything that ever was and everything that will ever be because that goes towards the greater good  of  mankind and I will see the sphinx before the phoenix rises out of the creamed corn of the children man man yogurt blossom in the cafeteria like bomb shells exploding in the darkness of siagon I will see them and laugh like the little devil that I am the yogurt man of my brain laughs with them and he laughs at the absurdity of it all at the absurdity of the LOCNAME chick which is in my class but does not see the truth which is me in the flesh and doe not see the truth which is me in the flesh of life I want to know everything I want to see everyone I want to fuck everyone in the world I want to do something that matters but the things that matter don't matter anymore my yogurt blossom repairman I thin k that I like you yogurt blossom time stream of consciousness test we are one in the same you and I watching as other s write time ticking endlessly away and our scroll bars move down ever so slightly and we presses the finish button and everyone goes wow that test really sucked and the professor get all the money and I say to you blessed are the meek they shall inherit the turf of the astrodome where I went when I was twelve to eat a dome dog and watch that team play my dad gave us peanuts to eat and I ate them and then I beat some poor bastard in the head with them and then I laughed because it was very funny and I laughed and it was funny but a whitney brown was not funny instead he was a stupid son of a bitch and not very funny at all except his face and his small groin which was funny funny funny hahahahah this must sound crazy to you I know because like me everything is crazy I am the crazy man bob who howls at midnight and I will always be crazy and good but I am the bob man I am the mystical food poisoning which one gets on prom night and throws up all night long while the lesbian you brought to prom hates your girlfriend and they presume to bight each others heads off all night long because they are the spawn of the devil whose name begins with baieszselbub I am the spawn whose e name is fish egg mc chicken pants and you shall know us by the trail of dead which spits tobacco out of his face and eats the eternity of my growing head and you see that I am the man whose face is in the shape of a marshmallow and the crackers of his should are in the face of them man who is the mouse pad mc cheese and the man who is in t ehldfsdjljdjd the lavalamp in the brain of the man is interestingly enough the same orgasm of a young boyscout whom saves the squirrel for later if you get my drift talk about safe sex it does not get much safer than having sex with a squirrel    squirrels are cool dudes but dudes are not cool squirrels and then you can eat them and they taste quite goodly in a stew pot but don't  eat the pot because the pot becomes you and the pot is the pot which is not like other pots but a magical pot of endemic portly proportions which name is nut tickling nipples nancy mcgee and you shall know this pot and know it well you should for in it lies your salvation and undoing for you will fear me for I am the scourge of god If you had not sinned he would not have sent me hither to punish you   
__label__label0 words are pouring out like endless rain into a paper cup they (?). but I like to use     periods. before, I was tempted to say, last night my ears met their lover. too bad they     didn't. haven't?  I just wanted to use that nice quote I stole from an editor of epitonic. I     have an hour till I have to go to LINK but I really don't know about this whole Christian     organization on campus thing I need to find one that fits me!  oh thoughts and feelings     sometimes I stare out at nothing in particular and it's in those times that I am thinking     about absolutely nothing oh I just got a call. but I'm still typing!  darn you booksellers call     back after nine thirty. I wonder if typos make a difference because I don't like leaving     them behind like that, so careless. So, I need to get a haircut. But how do I know which     kind?  You know, some people just look good no matter what. I think it's a level of     achievement that I will never reach. Oh well. What if people were the same inside and     outside?  Like, for example, if all the pretty people were extremely good souls. Now that'd     make things different. I can't really imagine what it'd be like, because I'm so busy thinking     about what I should write next. Man, what should I pursue?  My stomach is really full. I     used to think that if I ever smoked, I could quit anytime, just because it seems so gross. Well I can't even moderate my eating habits. And I bash myself about it, but when hunger     calls, I respond. In full!  So yeah. Sometimes I fear for my safety when I'm walking around     at night. Nothing ever bad has ever happened but I think I should still be careful. But I     don't think so enough since I'm going to do it tonight anyway. I'm going to watch the     LOCNAME at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Theatre. Yeah. Hey. I wonder if I'm going to make     any good friends here at college. It's bad hanging out with old ones all the time, and     believe me, sometimes I just don't want to. Excuse me. I just sneezed. What if I do really     think in sentences?  I think I have a cold. My nose is rubbed pretty raw (well, not really)     from all the tissues. I'm not thinking about anything. Actually, what I would like is to     complete everything I need to get done soon. I don't know how possible that might be but     then that would leave me time to do leisurely activities, like reading and responding to     other people's e-mails. I'm so bad at that. And so I could have time to read the Bible and     pray. Ah, I cannot control what I do, or at least I'm not trying hard enough. It seems so     easy to be a good Christian when the pastor is talking about it but then laziness gets the     best of me. Oh I can wait. You know, I don't want to think I'm invincible. I want to make a     difference and experience life fully. The things I am most scared about now: public     speaking. I just want to die when all eyes are on me- the bigger the audience, the more     humiliating. You know, it's not like I can control how I feel, to an extent at least. I am also     afraid of getting into a car accident because my close friends just did and it seems     unbearable, the time in the hospital spent recovering. So many tubes. I'd cry out. And I'm     afraid of falling off my bike or getting into some other bike related accident. It's not so     much the pain that bothers me, but the public scene it would cause. How embarrassing. Oh well. Sometimes I don't care what other people think. Sometimes I wonder what they     think of me. When I'm shy, I tend to come across as being mean. I haven't really opened     up to anyone before. Why should I if I don't trust them or if I'm not sure that they care     about what I feel or think. I think I'm good at observing people in their behaviors. When     I'm talking to someone, I can tell if they lose interest in what I'm saying. At that very     moment when they look away for a second. I don't feel bad when that happens but it just     makes me lower the probability of me finding someone or some people who can connect     with me. I know. People need people. And I need a tissue right now. Is this going to be     read?  If it is, it's okay. I don't know if my thoughts are interesting, but it would be a fun     thing to grade. I feel like I'm spending less quality time when I'm reading out of my     textbooks. I want to go back, but then I just get this feeling of urgency. Even when I'm     surfing the net. Imagine that. What do I have to do anyway?  What's the difference     between an erection and an ejaculation?  I think I might know, but it doesn't matter so     much to me. I don't like it how professors can say whatever they want to say, like curse     words and sex related and other inappropriate topics. Just because they can talk about it     doesn't mean they should. Sheesh. I also don't like how repeated exposure to talk I don't     agree with and cuss words will desensitize me to it completely, probably by the end of the     semester. Here I am in college and I don't know everyone but a lot of them are making me     less pure. I don't think they realize what they're doing to the rest of us. What rest of us,     you ask?  I guess we are a minority then. I wonder what I'm going to do for the final     project in my freshman seminar. Either fencing, a Christian organization on campus, if I     ever find a good one!  or a concert. Although a concert might be kinda difficult since I'm     not going to one until October 0th. Yay for Beulah!  I'm so excited. When I go to shows, I     feel like I belong. I don't know anyone there, but I like to observe them. Most of them     have styles. I wish I had a style. I want to be like them. Or do I?  I want to be like me!  But,     I need to be more like me then. Maybe if I had a lot more money. I do have a lot of     money. What does being fashionable feel like?   Not as great as I think, of course. It just     hurts to see people wearing things out of fashion when they think they are in fashion. We     are the elite. At least my mind can distinguish between the two. But only street. What do     I make of myself then?  It's easy not to care, but it's not so easy to do that completely. Will     that make people like me more?  Is it easy to avoid everyone and keep to myself?  Is that     what we were meant to do?  The answer is no. What if it's different for me?  Everyone dies     alone, right PROPNAME?  I think I need clothes to reach the next level. Of making me satisfied. Oh, if I had a different body. No, no. That's alright then. People who know you don't care. It's the people you are trying to impress who care!  Hah. I wonder if I ever hurt anyone's     eyes. It pains me to think so. Before I left for college, at the goodbye dinner thrown for     me by my uncle, the message in my fortune cookie (or rather, one of them) was be     yourself and you will always be in fashion. "  I suppose that's valid. Ooh I can continue     writing. Maybe for a bit longer. I wonder what it would be like to be very fashionable. I     mean, come on, I already struggle against feelings of superiority when it comes to music. What good does it do?  There are always better, there are always worse. But I won't say any     more about that. You know, I can't give all of myself away    and to a stranger!         (ok, I finished editing my paper)_ do you think that this (spilling out thoughts on paper) is     healthy for all of us?  not that it's not, but compared to making no difference    I think so. 
__label__label1 Ah! 0secs! O no 00 sec! er. er. what am I supposed to type. this is kinda stupid. ah! phone! must not answer. must not answer! hi PROPNAME! er. talking to PROPNAME. typing with one hand. not thinking straight. can't multi-task. Ah! 0min 00 sec! hang up PROPNAME! hang up! eeek. panicking! Talking about tomorrow's chem Exam. Man, didn't even know until just a few minutes ago when PROPNAME called to remind me. Hm. I should start studying right after I finish this. I got to get more organized and responsible. I wonder what other peoples thoughts are like, I watched What Women Want not too long ago, that is a very interesting movie. it says a lot about how women think. I wonder if any of it is actually true. wouldn't it be nice to know what women are thinking. I would like that power, I can never really tell what they are thinking. my room mate is watching an anime with cute girl voices and drama. I think it's called LOCNAME LOCNAME or something like that. reminds me of Fruits basket. o well, hm. there never seems to be adiquet lighting around my work area. maybe I should get another light, my room mate is laughing. the anime sounds funny, making all those funny anime noises. I miss something. I don't know what. I should call An-Vi earlier today, I think she was kind of disappointed that I didn't call her the other day. I wonder how college is like for her in ORGNAME, she says it is nice and all, but I bet there are a lot of good looking guys there. heh, what am I talking. thinking about. shouldn't worry. hm. I wonder. don't know what I'm wondering, PROPNAME's thoughts were much better I think, mine are just not really relevant. ice cream. why? I don't know. being influenced by others thoughts :p o well. need more water, can't drink water from first few weeks of school. I miss hugging her. I feel lonely. don't know why, there are a lot of pretty girls in LOCNAME LOCNAME, a lot of asians. wonder why everyone likes to party so much. mom always says that there will be someone for me, there are tons of pretty girls in LOCNAME. guess she was right, but don't know if any of them will like me. :sigh: I would like a better hair style, mine seems too plane, I would like to spike it like PROPNAME but not as short as most guys nowadays. 00 min. I wonder how much I've written, I should learn to type faster. ice cream. food. hm. I've been eating less lately. pretty much only eating lunch. a late lunch at that, The hills are a live with the sound of music!" heh, don't know why I just thought of that, 00 min. hm. :looking at finish button: I wonder if I'll be able to print this out. I feel like I'm not thinking deep enough, I wonder why. should I go back this week or no? I want to because my parents probably miss me, and I want to tell them to be less stressed so their immune system won't become worse. there is a potluck party this weekend back home apparently. my roommate is going back, I'm not really thinking any of this I think. it's more like a cover of what my mind is really chaotically thinking about. I don't know, I can't explain it. I can't sleep well. never could. wish I could. then I could stay awake in class. :blank:. well, Merry x'mass for you is on my songs list. it's sung by PROPNAME PROPNAME. wouldn't it be nice to be friends with her, I wonder if I can ever become really important, eh, I think it's more important to know as much as possible and help more people, like superman or something. well, hm. about 00 sec left. I feel like I should type something more meaningful, I've pressed backspace a lot. I wonder how my sister is. I want to go to a party. and meet more people. I wonder how PROPNAME is, he was mad at me, don't know for sure now. PROPNAME is cool, she likes some things that I didn't know anyone else would like, interesting how life works out. didn't know my friend in high school's hobbies would make me interested in something that someone else would be interested in. funny how life is. I've coincidently met people I've not really known but just know on the streets of the campus lately. like Grace and PROPNAME and some other friends. I think I'm getting better at talking. I want to get smarter. I feel small for some reason. dreams are for the lazy. goals are for the ambitious. I like to dream. I'm ambitious. is that bad or good? I have no idea. 
__label__label1 My head hurts so bad right now, why. I need more tea, I'm thirsty. what do I have to do tomorrow. bio. lab, lots of reading. that sucks, I wonder how many pages I actually have to read, like 0 chapters. ew. I need to turn in this form to the health office, actually I'm not sure where I need to turn it into, I should call PROPNAME and find out. I wish I had frozen yogurt right now. I need a job. where are my roommates are. my head hurts so bad right now. I need to get one of those egg crate things for my bed, I think that'll help my back, I'm so tired, I need to take a nap. I need to do homework. I should call my mom later and tell her about the stress causes immune suppression thing, what's my brother is doing. I should call my dad too, I haven't talked to him like four weeks. I need to send him the letter I wrote. wow, my head really hurts. I should call PROPNAME and see if she is going to be in LOCNAME LOCNAME this weekend. I wonder why her and her boyfriend broke up, he is a jerk, oh well. I need to call PROPNAME and tell her to buy me a gift for PROPNAME's birthday this weekend. I wish it was my birthday, I need a vacation already. how many tests I have next week. PROPNAME's coming next week, what time does his flight come in, I should call him tonight and find out. what time does he get off work, I need to find a nice place for us to eat, what's on sixth street, I should call PROPNAME she had know. I need to clean my room before friday. yesterday was grandparents day I think, I need to call my grandma. I want to go to LOCNAME LOCNAME for the winter break. I'm so tired right now. Sept. 00 is this week, wow, that is like two years, goodness. wow. I need to go to the grocery store. oh yay, PROPNAME's home. this should be fun, except not at all, I wonder if she is driving to class tomorrow, I should get a ride, I hate riding the bus. I hate standing up on the bus. I think it should be a rule that if you're a boy you have to stand up for girls on the bus. my first class is at 00 in the morning. I have so much to read. did I take my medicine this morning. I think. I can't believe how much I forget lately, I need to get that checked out. PROPNAME's team is playing us in a volleyball tournament this weekend, I should call her and see what time so I can go watch, PROPNAME is coming in this weekend. oh, that's going to be so much fun. we should go downtown. I need money. I need a job, I wonder if I can get a job here at the apartment complex, I bet that'd lower my rent. all of a sudden I stopped capitalizing my I's . I think it makes me type faster. that's neat, I love my smell-good candle, my head hurts, how long does advil take to work, I need to go check my mail . when's our electric bill due? I'm hungry, what did I eat today. I need to buy more milk and sweet n low. I'm not going to the grocery store till sunday, oh, I have to get my film developed before monday, I should take it to one hour photo, at the grocery store. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing, I should go chill with her instead of reading for bio. discussion. I need to clean my room and do laundry before this weekend, oh my stomach hurts too. I wonder if I took my ulcer medicine this morning, I need to get my prescription filled. I have to go register to vote in LOCNAME this week, or next week maybe. oh my gosh my head is killing me this sucks. oh my 00 minutes are up. 
__label__label0 Crap, I was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something. I really hope it didn't already submit because I don't want to screw up my credit for this paper. Great, now I'm completely paranoid that I've managed to screw up something so simple. I'll keep my fingers crossed. I need all the help I can get to do well in this class. Actually, I haven't worried about my grades in a long time. When tests start, I'll panic. It's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures. I never get enough rest. My schedule's all out of order. I can't fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven. I'm tired all day long. I hear my TV and want to go watch it. I always put stuff off and watch too much television. I have a problem with procrastinating. I never used to be this bad. I'm scared that since I can't get on a study plan, I'll fail. I hate it when I over use a word when I'm writing. I feel like I haven't written enough, but does length matter?  My birthday is next week, which somewhat depresses me. I'm not close to any of my friends, and I'm scared they're going to forget about me. I feel like the only loser out of my friends who's not having this great college experience. It's not that I'm homesick, just kind of restless and bored. I haven't met that many people and frankly, feel like an outcast. My head hurts, but I have no tylenol. I hate swallowing pills. I used to break them up and put them in yogurt. I'm such a wuss. My roommate went home for the afternoon. I'm glad she is gone. She can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness. I went out of town one weekend, and she made my bed. I don't really want her invading my space and touching my things. 
__label__label0 My roommate just had a sandwich from subway, and the smell is killing me. It's one of my favorite things to eat. He gets somewhat annoying, though. Right now he is playing a video game, and he is got the volume turned way up. I don't mind so much; it's just hard to get my thoughts straight. I hate the way milk leaves a sour taste in your mouth. I always end up having to chew some gum or brush my teeth again, but it is so good. Everything I am saying sounds really stupid. I guess that's how the mind works though. I've never actually had to plot out my exact thoughts. Most of them just kind of run through my head, with the important ones being the only truly pondered thoughts. He (my roommate) keeps talking to his game. It's getting old. The game is cool though; a bit violent but very addictive. It even gets a little scary at night some of the time. Nights are so weird here. It always feels a lot later than it is, or not late enough. I always end up forgetting to call home and my girlfriend because by the time I remember it's too late to be calling the east coast. I don't know where my relationship with her is going. We've been dating for almost four years. Maybe I should tell my roommate that the talking gets annoying. Would that offend him though?  I don't know. I don't know about a lot of things. And I just realized that I just used the word don't know. "  The internet lingo is getting out of hand. I used to be online almost all day long. He is still talking. At least I can look forward to the game this weekend. For once I won't mind the noise. It's kind of exciting. My first LOCNAME game. I am so bored. I really need to meet people. Being from out-of-state definitely has its downside. Everyone seems to know everybody here and that doesn't help me very much. It seems a little awkward to walk up to someone and introduce myself, but that's what I have to do or I'll be spending a lot of time in my dorm room. That, my friend, was a run off sentence, but I'm much too lazy to correct it right now. Stayed up too late last night because I don't have any classes today. I should really finish my homework after this, but I am way too lazy for that. There it goes. My roommate made me lose where I was going with that last thought. I'm kind of thirsty right now, I should get a bottle of water. The Austin water is gross. I'm definitely not feeling the fact that there are no agents in the water to clean it. We've been buying water left and right. We should really get a ORGNAME filter. This game really is addicting. I just lost all train of thought watching it for a matter of 00 seconds. I don't think that it's a good thing to do that. This whole writing is filled with vague pronoun references. My 00th grade english (is that supposed to be capitalized) would murder me if she knew I was writing like this, but I suppose it is okay as long as I don't get into the habit of writing this way. I am really slack. I'm only taking 00 hours this semester and I still don't do any homework. At least I am doing okay on my graded assignments. Oh well. This is college life and for once I'm not going to have my mom around to push me to study and do my work. The timer seems like it is moving a lot slower now than before. Just like when I'm running; it always takes so much longer for 00 minutes to pass when I'm on one the treadmill. Very dull, indeed. 
__label__label1 The start of this semester has been again full of stress and anxiety. I wake up everyday depressed and knowing that the day will only bring about more problems. It is a bit pessimistic of me but this is what I am used to. For instance, right now I can feel my head throbbing because of my headache. The only reason I have it in the first place is because of school. The hardships of being a pre-med student have already taken a toll on me and sometimes I think I'm not strong enough to continue. The only think that keeps me going is the thought of one day making my parents proud. Yet, this means that I have to do extremely well in all of my classes and for the past year I have done far from that. I constantly worry about my ORGNAME and not getting into medical school and it gets to a point where I tune out everything else. I'm even thinking about my chances at medical school right now typing this diary". This is the sad truth about me and I try to cope with it. I remember in the summer I had lost all care of school and ORGNAME and I was finally happy and in a world of peace. I had thought that my return back to school would be much for more exciting because I had stopped worrying about this whole pre-med issue. Sadly, I'm here again thinking about it non-stop. Its almost like I go to school to impress my family rather than trying to have a fun filled 0 years. Why is it so difficult to become a doctor if you know that its what you want to do? Why do I have to compete with my peers for the few spots open in medical schools? Sometimes these questions drive me nuts. I try my best to distract myself from it. Like right now I'm listening to the rain hit my window. The sound of it crashing my window is so soothing and peaceful and I wish I was just outside splashing around. My life has turned into this academic challenge and I hardly have time for myself and my needs. I guess that's why I join organizations. Then again, they make matters only worse when they share with me how wonderful their ORGNAMEs are. I would do freshmen year all over again in a heartbeat if someone ever gave me the chance. I regret the recklessness I showed toward my work, thinking it was all going to be a piece of cake like high school. Maybe that is why I make my brother study so much. I never want him to make the mistakes I made yet am I ruining his own social life by doing this? I believe I don't. I think that in the end he will be thankful because he won't have to worry about taking 00 hours very semester just to raise his GPA so that schools will think of him as "competitive". I wish sometimes I had had a guide. My roommate from last year was a business major and all he did was read a textbook for 00 minutes and then watch TV and I would undoubtedly get dragged in. It makes me so angry to think that I was so immature and nonchalant. On a side note, I've never ranted so much before especially on the computer. It's kinda helping me to take off mental burden that I carry. However, staring at this bright monitor is only increasing my headache. Anyways, I basically just frustrate myself over this whole medical school dilemma. I wish I could just go into the future and not have to worry about this anymore. The day I get the acceptance letter (or rejection letter) will be the happiest day of my life. I'll probably try again the next year but it won't matter to me as much anymore. I don't really know how to explain it but that same anxiety that goes with "first times" won't be there anymore. I've considered many majors and have really thought about doing something else with my life but somehow I'm always dragged back into medicine. Maybe its the challenge that I like even though at times I would gladly give it up. Maybe I worry so much about my future because I really want to see myself become a doctor. This is truly my passion and I'll never give up on it no matter how hard it gets at times. I just hope I'm not the only one going through this hysteria because it would really make me look like a psychopath after this. Even so, something tells me that I'm not alone out there and sometimes that just brightens up my day even if it's for a short while. 
__label__label0 I think I'm trying to hard to write what I'm thinking which defeats the entire purpose of this paper, you aren't supposed to think about what you write, you're supposed to write what you think about. Wow, I was impressed with that little quote there. I cannot live without you. " I've had that song stuck in my head all day long. It's a good song but I only know that much of it. I wish I could actually sing the rest of the words to that song instead of mumbling through them. I have a problem with singing lyrics. Why am I reading over what I have just wrote? I guess it's just a habit that I've gotten into after writing so many essays in my life. I usually despise essays. I love writing, just not essays. Hmmm. was that a pretty girl that just walked by? I just caught her foot as she passed my door. I think it was a pretty foot. I need to find a girlfriend. Girlfriends are great. Well, they can be. Depending on who it is. I loved my last girlfriend to death. I miss her so much. I hate not being able to see her any more. Curse age! Of course I do not wish I was 0 years younger but I do wish that she was 0 years older. Why did I bother to redo that sentence? I actually wrote 0 sentences and then combined them to make one. Am I following all of the rules to the "Stream of Consciousness" writing assignment?              I wonder if you can determine if a person has ADD by reading a "Stream of Consciousness" paper. Hell, by the time you get done with mine, you will probably think I am. Hell, hell, hell, hell, that word just stuck in my head for some reason. I wonder if that means that I'm satanic. "Thegreatjakobie" just signed onto ORGNAME instant messenger. "I can't talk buddy! I'm writing what I think!"          Metacognition. Thinking about thinking. That is such a cool concept. I often think about MEtacognition so I guess I can say that I often think about thinking about thinking. That actually makes sense. "I cannot live without you!. all that kjsoifl me, alkjsoithaj me, I cannot live without you!" Damn words. I should probably learn them. I often spell a word that I know how to spell but it doesn't look right when I write it so I spend like 0 minutes trying to determine if it's spelled right. I'm thinking about that damn song again. My elbow hurts. It pops a lot. I wonder if that means it's going to fall off one day. I don't think it's healthy. I don't know anybody else who's elbow hurts and pops on a regular basis. "Strike 0! You're out!" I hate baseball, but it popped into my head when I spelled basis. Bases. Stases! Rhetoric and Comp class sucks. It's not my cup of tea. Have you ever been in one of those really big tea cups that spin around really fast at carnivals? They suck too. When I get done I feel like I'm going to vomit all over my shoes. Vomit stinks a bunch. My friend PROPNAME doesn't like vomit either. He says that when he smells vomit, it makes him want to vomit too. And all the people around him will see all this vomit and pretty soon, the whole room is blowing chunks all over each other. Chain vomiting. Comforting. I'd like to stop thinking about vomiting now. "I cannot live without you!"        Latin drums can seriously rock! Especially in that damn song that I have had stuck in my damn head all day. My face itches. I hate when things itch. That would be a feeling that I would rather not have. If I had a choice of course. Only 0 minutes left! That sucks! I'm kind of getting into this whole writing thing! We should do this assignment every week! That would rock. oooooooowwwwwwwww! Damnit! I was stretching and when my arms came back down I hit my already broken ass elbow on my chair. That sucked! Oh man, that really depressed me. That hurt a whole bunch. AhhhH! 00 more seconds! Lets see how many letters I can hit! kasdfkjhasdkfjhaksdjhfkljasdhfkljadshfkljadshfkljahdsfkljhasdklfjhaklsdjhklahciluhekjhsdfkljahdsfkljhasfdkljhicukljaeno;iawejoijackjnOWEDJOAUR0000U0R000JOFJIEODFIJA0WE0URFOJKLJSDCVLIUADSHFCKJENRFLKH0PC0USDCIOAJERFKJRIOFJUP00UFOASDFJKJNCKDSJCPOAIUFPO0WUERO0QU0W0ROIQWJREFKNSDOVJOAISDUJVA00WEUF0WUEFROAWKEJRFLKIJSDFOLAIJSDFOIAUJFOIKW0EJFOIJASDOIFJASLDKFJAO;SDIFUJ0WAOEJFLKNVOIJC0000I0-00I-0I-0           hA!  That's how many letters I can type in 00 seconds. Well, technically, it was less than that because I was finishing that last sentence up. Well, my 00 seconds are up. Good luck on trying to pull meaning from this madness. 
__label__label1 I guess I should begin by saying I'm pretty tired today. I woke up feeling sort of sick. My throat hurt a little bit, and my body ached as well. The dorm rooms are really cold. I went to the financial aid office for some information but I don't even remember how to access what the lady told me to. I've been thinking a lot lately and worrying about school. I'm worried about this college algebra class I'm supposed to be getting into through ORGNAME. They said they haven't received my transcript although I know it was sent from LOCNAME on August 00, I even have the receipt. It pisses me off that ACC's records department is screwed up. This class is really important to me so that I can take my core classes next semester or so. Besides that stress, I've been stressed about PROPNAME. It doesn't really feel like we've been broken up. I know it's only been a week, but it doesn't feel like it to me. I think he is really more upset about it than me. My cell phone bill should be coming in the mail soon and I know my dad is going to kill me because it's going to be super expensive. The guy sitting next to me in this computer lab is typing super fast! He reminds me of the part on Meet the Parents" where he is at the airport looking for a different flight and the clerk types really fast and finds nothing. Makes me smile. Tomorrow I think I'll go to ACC's records department. I mean, I have a receipt that says I sent the transcript, so I wonder what kind of run around they will give me this time. Last time they were extremely rude to me. I mean, I'm new to all this, especially to ACC. It's not like I knew they would lose my transcript. The computer lab down here in the basement of Jester is pretty hot. I don't feel an air-flow. Just still air, and the typing of the guy sitting next to me. He just left right now. I heard him talk on his cell phone a few minutes ago about getting something to eat, which sounds good to me right now. I had some oreo's while in class today, and my friend PROPNAME was talking about how fat she is gotten, the girl is super skinny, not to mention in great shape because she runs 0 miles a day! But she was saying that oh my gosh oreo's are so fattening, yet she would kill for one. I offered her one, but she declined. I thought to myself oh my god! What is this girl thinking. All she talks about is what she eats and doesn't eat. It was kinda getting on my nerves, but oh well. I enjoyed the oreos and that's all that matters. I didn't feel guilty about eating them since I am probably going to go to the gym later on tonight. I wish I would have had some milk with those oreos though! New guy sitting next to me in computer lab. I hope he doesn't glance over and wonder what I'm doing. I guess I am pretty focused on my computer screen. I feel relaxed though. The chair is comfortable and my gum still has flavor. Still too hot though. I guess basements are supposed to be a little hot. PROPNAME just left me a voice message that she was going to eat some dinner and if I wanted to go. I hope she doesn't find out I am writing about her! I know I've said nothing bad about her, but I think she could get her feelings hurt. She is a really sweet girl and I really don't have anything negative to write about her. Besides, I don't typically talk about people. I guess I always put myself in the other person's shoes. I wouldn't want people to talk about me! Don't know when I'm going to go home. I miss everyone, but I really like my freedom here. Coming and going as I please. Not having to be home at 00 and calling and checking in. I like being independent. Not that I resent anyone or anything from home, but I like being on my own and all. It feels cool and I feel all grown up! PROPNAME's phone just rang and she is trying to be real quiet! She is so cute! I'm glad she is up here with me because I really don't know what I would have done if she hadn't decided to come to school here. We're really close and I enjoy that. Whoa, I almost thought I lost all of my work because a window screen popped up about some debugging! Scary!         
__label__label0 I wonder if I still have time to turn in my books to get a full refund. if I can't then its going to be pretty bad. I'm definitely not going to type correct grammar and punctuation on this paper. I mean does my brain think in grammar. nope. its thinks how I talk. PROPNAMEs song is really loud on his computer right now. I remember that I used to hate this song when I first heard it but now its good. I really don't want to read my chemistry chapter. think about kumchev. his class is pointless to go to because you can't understand what he is trying to say. I keep on seeing the time counting at the top of the screen but I'm trying not to look at it. its probably inevitable though. if you see something like that and you tell yourself not to look at it its basically guaranteed. that is a funny word. why is there weird spellings in words. this guitar part in this song is really crazy right now. I'm trying so hard no to look at the timer. its killing me. what a fun game this is. ok time to change songs. I wonder what the heck jackie thinks about me. I wish she would just open up and not hold back. what the heck is she so afraid of. PROPNAME PROPNAME is really crazy looking. I hope I don't fall asleep in art today. this is an awesome assignment. I love this crap. I used to do this in english when we were supposed to be writing rough drafts for papers. why do teachers monitor kids work in class. what if I don't want to do it in class. mrs waggoner was the worst ever. what the heck was her problem. I love this guitar part right here. I wonder what song is playing on joels computer right now. I think it might be the counting crows or somebody like that. I think I might go insane trying not to look at the clock up top. I wonder how much time has passed. probably like three minutes. ok I was just drumming on the space bar. I love drumming. playing the ir guitar is probably the best though. it looks awesome when you see people that are playing it as they are walking. its funny. I just like how many crazy people there are here in austin. I just want to become a rockstar. and I really want to go surfing with jackie right now. what a cool chick. that matchless amp really didn't sound that good now that I think about it. I would go fender twin all the way. that carbon fiber guitar was awesome and so was that acoustic amp. I really need to get my guitar fixed. haha. we play in like two weeks and I don't have one that works. I love thinkin about that. I wonder what I'm going to do. there is no use worrying about it though. it will all work out. I don't understand why people worry. the odds are that you what you worry about will be ok. and even if something really bad happens you don't think that you will be able to deal with it. but it you will so why worry at all. I think my mom is the biggest worrier that I have ever met. I don't see how she could waste her life doing it. wooaahh. a duck noise just came on my computer. I remember fred. he was a cool duck. I had a duck in my dream the other night. how random is that. I wish I was telepathic. how awesome would that be. that would be the best ever. I wonder how much time has passed now. its really crazy trying not to look at the clock. I wonder if I should run tonight. I probably need too. this is one of the best solos I have ever heard. I wonder if joel is going to work out tonight. I hope so because I want to run but I can't make myself if someone does not go with me. queen is a weird band. I wonder what songs our dj next class. that would be a fun job. I think it would be funny to play some crazy songs on. I wish that I could do really crazy stuff in class. like throw books at people. I don't want to hurt em but think about how funny it would be to see some just lose it. and like fart really loud when everything is quiet. I think that would the ultimate. I wonder what I made on my calculus quiz. probably a hundred because I'm a genius. 
__label__label1 Well I'm a bit nervous about this. Not that I really have any reason to be nervous, but college in general has been all new to me and a bit scary and overwhelming. I'm really tired right now, but I can't go to sleep because I have so much to do. My body is getting so run down. I really ought to take care of myself, I know. Well, I did go to yoga today. Besides, if I go to bed early, my roomie will stay up and make noise, something that makes me unable to sleep. Unfortunately, only I have early morning classes. Not her. But I love PROPNAME. Best friend, ya know. Oh well. I wish I could have more time to study though. Then I would have more time to sleep. Then I would enjoy life a bit more, I think. I liked hearing in Psych today that everyone is stressed first semester of freshman year. I truly did think I was the only one. Well yippee! I'm not alone! Although, I don't think EVERYONE is juggling 00 hours, with work, organizations, and a lot of time-consuming friends! But I guess a lot of people have their own time problems. Like if they are in a frat or sorority or something. Those apparently take a lot of time. That's totally not my kind of thing though, so I'm glad that I'm not doing it. Also, being in sports takes a lot of time I'm sure. Band too. PROPNAME is in band. He says it's a lot of fun, but I think it wouldn't be my thing either. Unless they sang in band. In which case, I would really enjoy it. Or dance. Dance is awesome. I really miss it. But you know, when I went clubbing this weekend, I really hated it. I hated how guys treated me like a piece of meat and basically violated my personal space and being. I felt like crap. I really hated it. And the thing is, I really wanted to hit the library that night, but nooooo, they said I would enjoy the club because it was salsa dancing - one of my favorites. Wouldn't you know it - they had like one salsa song. Man, that was upsetting. It turned out to be a horrible night. I mean, horrible. PROPNAME is going to bed now. That's a first. She ALWAYS goes to bed after me. Seriously, that's a first. I hope I don't wake her by typing. Actually my comp is kind of quiet now that I think about it. Besides, she claims she is not disturbed by little sounds. So good. I don't think it'll be too much of a problem. My head hurts. And this light shining on my keyboard is actually making my fingers hot. That's kind of creepy. I don't think lights are supposed to do that. Oh well. I really have to use the bathroom now. Hah. I bet that's a psychological thing. I only feel that way just because I know I can't leave the computer because I've got 00 more minutes left. How does this thing work? How can this computer tell me what my psyche is like? I mean, its a computer! How is it able to read what I have written, and then analyze it and give me a response? Hehe, maybe the TAs have to stay at the computer 00-0 so they can write in the responses. Hehe. Sorry, Mr. TA. I know that's not funny. Oh my god it's late. I'm talking to the non-existent TA, I'm so tired. Well if it weren't for all that studying I tried to finish, it wouldn't be so late! But of course, even after spending almost every free moment I had today, reading, I still am not even anywhere NEAR catching up in reading! It's all because of that stupid, stupid sociology class I dropped! I'm seriously upset about that! I mean, that class was by far the hardest class in terms of reading assignments. If only I had add/dropped the class sooner, I wouldn't have wasted all of my precious time on that one class. And then I end up switching sociology classes. Man. I make myself so mad sometimes. Well, hey. I am a freshman and new to all of this stuff. I guess it'll just take me awhile to figure all these things out. LOCNAME is so huge. I don't know if I will ever get used to the size. Actually, I'm not sure it's fully hit me yet anyway. But how on earth did I end up here? I was headed for famous, private colleges in the northeast, that were small, which was my main want in a college. Yet I've ended up at the biggest! PROPNAME is calling on my cell. Poor guy. He is had such a rough night. But hey bub. I'm doing my homework right now. I hope he doesn't think that I'm ignoring him. Well I am, I guess. But I do plan on calling him back. Although that would mean sacrificing more sleep, but oh well. He needs someone right now. I think that's also a problem I have. I spend to much time with my friends. Too many friends sometimes. Sometimes it seems like there aren't enough. Strange how that is. Well I know online (AIM) I definitely have enough friends to talk to. That's so hard. AIM always sucks me in because I get to talk to people who live far away and that I never get to see. I waste so much valuable time on that! Ugh. I procrastinate too much. Well, no, that's not true. I spend A LOT of time doing important things. And I guess AIM and hanging out with friends are my way of relaxing and taking a break. Although they really aren't breaks. Because they require so much emotion, and attention, and energy! So then I need even more sleep! BLOCNAME THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I CAN'T EVER GET! Same with in high school! Ugh. I was such an overachiever. All that for nothing though. ORGNAME didn't even look at all the extra work I did. Replacing lunch for a class. Not having any free time because of all the organizations and officer positions. So much going on. And all UT looked at was the fact that I was in the top 0%. Whoopee. Now I'm in. I think that makes UT a lot less prestigious. For that very reason, UT was my backup school. Because it was so easy for me to get into. Ooh, time is almost over. Last thoughts, LOCNAME? No. I keep thinking about sleep. Hehe. I can't get it off my mind. Maybe that's a sign. But I need to call PROPNAME PROPNAME. PROPNAME is moving. Did I wake her up? Oh, I can continue? Nah. I think this is enough. Besides, I need sleep! 
__label__label0 Damn, I'm really hungry. My girlfriend was really hungry too, so she came over to make some Spaghetti. I guess it's already almost 0pm, so dinner wouldn't be a bad thing. In fact, it would be a good thing. It's pretty hot outside today. I have a horrible crick in my neck. Almost like I've been looking in the same direction for ages and never had my hinges oiled. When I look to the left, it all seems to go away. Perhaps I should start sitting on the other side of the classrooms. I should start studying more often. I passed my Computer Proficiency Test today. not like I was terribly worried about it though. I had my first quiz at LOCNAME today as well. I ended up reading for my Financial Accounting class for an hour and a half at the AIM reading room at the school of business. I did a few homework problems at the end, but didn't finish them. If I would have been reading for my MIS class, I probably would have been prepared for the quiz. It's pretty straightforward stuff though--especially with me being a certified ORGNAME and ORGNAME network administrator. My roommate PROPNAME has been really sketchy lately. I think it has to do with the fact that we moved in together as 'eligible bachelors' after both breaking up from serious relationships. DAMN, those Italian herbs smell really good. It's making my mouth start to water really bad. I took a painting class last semester and did a few works -- one of them is sitting on my desk and keeps catching my attention. I also have a double PROPNAME's cup on my desk -- which is one of my favorite places to eat. I think I'm going to turn some music on now [empty thoughts] I'm now listening to the sound of 000 (their self titled album to be more specific) I wonder if you all will actually read these. My thought pattern seems to have become more spaced out since I've started listening to the music. Oop--now it's picking up again. I have a stack of CD's on top of my monitor. Do you?  Do you have a stack of anything?  I once saw a stack of hay at my friends ranch. The code to their ranch was 0000, because that's the year they purchased it. The funny thing is, he now incorporated that number plus the first initial of him, his mom, his dad, and his two dogs into being his screen name. This sucks that the time is going by so slowly. At first it seemed to pass by really quickly--with the lines of text slowly appearing, but the time going by in increments of 00 seconds. The spaghetti is ready. Damnit, I'm hungry but I have to sit here for a little while more and type to no one. I wonder why brass was chosen as a doorknob color. Maybe because it looks similar to gold -- and gold is a precious commodity. My stomach feels like it's burning right now. Those aromas are filling my nose. WOOOOO HOOOOO! My girlfriend, PROPNAME, just brought me a plate full of Spaghetti and Meatballs.  to have a bite  As much as I really want to sit here and keep typing, I think I'm going to grab a drink to pair with my spaghetti. Dr Pepper is pretty awesome. I can type and watch TV at the same time. I never thought being able to type without looking would be that good of a thing Now I get to use it while trying to complete my psychology assignment. Yeeeaaaah! The assignment is over. 
__label__label0 Hello, my name is PROPNAME. I felt like I needed to introduce myself since someone will be reading this assignment, and I am not familiar with that person. Anyhow, lets talk about some stuff. Hmm, where should I begin? I was born in PROPNAME. If your thinking this is like a biography, then I think that you will be wrong. However, back to what I was saying. I don't really like traveling to PROPNAME, LOCNAME. I find it kind of boring because I don't have anyone over there that is my age. All of my relatives are much older than I. These people don't tend to interest me because they are always bogged down with the problems that they create. Lets talk about my uncle for instance. I will not mention his name, however, he was. I mean is a drug addict and is constantly in and out of jail. Why would I be interested in going and visiting him unless I wanted some crack or something? He is a liar anyways, and I don't like affiliating myself with those kinds of people. Speaking of the kind of people I affiliate (if that's even how u spell the word) myself with, I think that I accidentally roomed with a gay person this semester. Had to look over my shoulder to make sure he's not behind me or something. However, he makes a lot of homosexual remarks, and although he says he is just playing, I think he does it all too frequently to be playing around. Anyways, I'm sick of talking about him because that guy is more and more annoying everyday. Lets talk about my big brother. Now this guy is someone who has his crap cut out. This is the reason that I look up to him. He knows how to manage his time, talk to his gf on the telephone for hours at a time, go out on the weekends, and still get all A's! I have to admit that I am somewhat jealous. However, he does help me out and gives really great advice. When he tutors me, I feel like he teaches better than a lot of professors. Maybe this is because he has known me for so long and knows how I retain material. He is two years older than me, but I am tired of talking about him because he always hogs the damn spotlight. Lets talk about my boxing, because that always gets me the respect and acknowledgement that I feel is so precious to a person. I hated not being respected. It made me sick to my stomach when someone would cut me in line or throw a pencil or whatnot at me and I couldn't do anything about it because that person had a physical strength advantage over me. However, I put an end to all that crap when I joined the boxing team in the summer of my freshman year in high school. I learned how to fight the hard way though. My coach sucked and didn't teach me a thing, so I just kept fighting and watching fights and picked up on different styles and tricks of the trade. I adopted a slugger's style of fighting. The reason is because my foot movement was never all that great. My strength began to get developed when I began lifting weights in my freshman year, and it suited my fighting style great. That year, a couple of kids decided to mess with me, so I took them to the mat room (part of the gym in my high school), and floored them one by one. Man it was great, the respect that those fights generated was awesome. From then on out, word of mouth about those fights got me my respect. I didn't even have to fight anymore! But I kept on because I got too competitive and I kind of liked it. Currently, I'm undefeated in my hometown. However, I was just an average fighter when it came to the Golden Gloves. I stopped when I started college. That's enough of that. My father is the next person I want to discuss. He has worked his way from rock bottom, and I admire that. He slept in a car for 0 months and bathed in a nearby river when he was working in maintenance away (for a railroad company called ORGNAME ORGNAME). He helps us out so much and he's funding my tuition for college all by himself (cause my mom divorced him a couple of years ago). I still love her and all, I just don't agree with anything she does. She seems to have tunnel vision, u know what I mean? Let me explain because my time here is almost up. She is one of those people who will see something she wants, and direct all of her attention to acquiring that one thing, no matter who she hurts. Today she seems more like a stranger, cause I don't see her all that much. She didn't invite me to her wedding. My time is up. Talk to u later. Bye 
__label__label0 It smells really good in my apartment. My roommate's girlfriend is making chicken and I'm cooking out. I love Monday night football. Its on tonight. it is Thursday night but this is the opening game but abc is covering the game. watching football is putting me in a good mood. I am in the process of cooking out on the grill. I'm really tired right now but I have a test tomorrow. last night I had like three hockey games. on real game and then the school team, we had practice. we got a new dog and it sometimes keeps me up at night. he is a jack russel terrier and his name is miller. the washing machine is going and it is really loud. just like the dishwasher. the patriots are winning now they just kicked a field goal. my girlfriend is doing her homework over in the dining room. I wonder what she is working on. the dishwasher stopped and now it is quiet in here. john madden annoys me. I'm not really watching the game because I'm doing this but I hear him commenting on the game. all he does is state the obvious. I don't need to hear him tell me what I just saw. I can believe he gets paid. I hope I get a good job like that were I get paid very well and the job can be fun. it just got really hot in my apartment really fast. I need to turn down the thermostat. I don't want to study tonight. I just want to chill. I am worrying occasionally because I changed my major and I am now trying to get into upper division. my new major is sport management. it used to be economics. a beer would great right now. I just saw a ORGNAME light commercial. that's good advertising. well I'm halfway done with this thing. there is not much to say I just keep thinking of the same things. I hope LOCNAME football wins this weekend. LOCNAME beat us last year but I think we will beat them this year. I need to go put the meat on the grill because I am hungry. I have to do this for 0 more minutes then I can do that. I'm cooking this really good sausage that my girlfriend bought in Elgin, LOCNAME. I'm so hungry. its making it worse because of my roommates food that they are making is smelling really good. hopefully the patriots will win this game. they are winning this game. they won last year in the conference championship. I'm ready for the hockey season to start. I wish I could go play hockey tonight. I wonder what my dog is doing. my roommate is yelling at him so I'm sure he is doing something mischievous because he is always doing stuff like that. be quiet john madden. this is a long twenty minutes. I'm still hungry. I'm ready for the weekend. it will be fun. dang the patriots are punting. I need a new car. mine is a 0 door PROPNAME that is a 00 so it is eleven year old. I can't wait till next Wednesday for the incubus concert. they are my favorite band and they are coming to Austin to play. it will be sweet. I'm going with all my friends. I should call my mom and let her know what is going on with me I wonder what she is doing 
__label__label0 o. k, so now I'm writing for this assignment. I'm going to turn off the music I'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, I like new order. I like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. I'm probably more into that than most people I know. I wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night I ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. I totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and I crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and I hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was "bamn" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that I still live at home, I still live at home. I'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but I'd like to have my own place. but I don't have the money for that because I pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but I do feel good when I say that to other people, usually at work is when I do that. I work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. I got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that I could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. I keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a "how are you" exchange. things are going better with my parents and I. there was a time before ut,(I'm a transfer from acc)where I didn't really care much about things. probably because I wasn't being challenged, except from work which I enjoyed/enjoy. anyway, I was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob PROPNAME type stuff. I have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although I wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. I stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. I wish I was done now. funny because I was looking forward to doing this, but I thought it would be more of a stop/start thought process. it seems like I'm just narrating my last couple of days. I was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and I am somewhat. wish I had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, I have to write for an entire twenty minutes. I wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this. my face is all rough and "treated". I have avg acne, not really the worst I've had. I am using treatment though which helps. my mom just went into the laundry room which I assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean. because I told her that I would clean it last night because I went on a bike ride instead. in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time. but for some reason I like wasting time. there she goes back into the laundry room. and no comment, but no inspection either. I have a good view from the office room where I am typing this twenty minute thing. itching my eye felt good. my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position. now that I noticed that, I noticed I'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to PROPNAME gym and how I can't really yet because I am a gimp. Not really though, I could easily tough it out, I'm competitive and athletic, or use to be. sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years. I knew I'd miss high school for that reason. I like when I repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when I typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance. I was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than I had expected in the end. ok, that was interesting, something I don't really want to do again, or do I? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing. ok, finished. 
__label__label1 I am overwhelmed with lots of work. Yesterday was very productive, and I intend for today to be the same way. I have no history to work on but I have to work on some Latin and some astronomy and go to a help session. I need to call PROPNAME and see if he wants to go see PROPNAME in College Station this Sunday. I hope he wants to do that because I want to be here on Saturday so that I can watch the football game in LOCNAME and spend time with PROPNAME and study Saturday. I need to eat some lunch soon but I have some things I need to get done before that. The lawn mower outside is very annoying, and I hate that there seems to never be a good time of the day for people to mow lawns. Last year they would start the mowers at 0 when I was sleeping and it bugged the hell out of me. There is a party on 0th tonight that I might go to but I am not sure of that, because I don't really like the group of people that are going. I don't want PROPNAME to go to that party in LOCNAME LOCNAME because he will end up staying there, and that makes me uncomfortable. This guy is going to Acc and his parents are going out of town so he is having a party. That sounds a little bit like high school to me. The people I have met from ACC just don't seem to have work ethic and I just don't understand how someone could not want to try their best to get far. I have noticed that there are many people at this school that don't think twice when they speak up, thoughts are never concluded when people begin to speak. There is too much individualism, people only want to listen to themselves talk. We live in a society where people are obsessed with themselves. I find that in history very few people make educated assumptions when reading literature. They pawn off what the professor says and act like it is their own words. I  love PROPNAME PROPNAME, people always ask him what his lyrics mean and he always just says " oh, their just words". Its great, I love it. I need to call my mommy today cause she called me last night, I saw this dog on campus today with its owner and it made me miss PROPNAME at home. I love that dog, she is so cute, I swear she has human tendencies. I just miss coming home this summer and coming home to a dog that is so happy to see you. I love dogs so much, I can't wait to be able to have my own. Aww, my computer has been making the most annoying sound in the world lately, and I can't stand it, it is just this sound that keeps on going, never gets worse or better, it just lulls, and drives me crazy. I hate this place so much sometimes. there is too much estrogen in this building, and the fact that guys are only allowed on the weekends kills me. Why can't my brother come up here during the week, I just don't get it. It is so old fashioned. I understand they want it to be a learning environment conducive to studying, but millions of college kids live in places where sexes can mingle and people make their grades. yesterday felt like my true beginning of the semester. I had a full day of academics. I started around 0 and didn't finish till around 00, and I went to sleep so exhausted that I had no trouble falling asleep. But, I wake up in the morning with my back so sore. I don't know if all this work is just stressing me and giving me pains in my body, I don't know. I just know it isn't' from working out, cause I haven't done that in a while. I am perfectly fine with my appearance at the moment, I haven't gained any weight in a long time, and I don't want to let myself. Last year I gained like 0 pounds and I hated myself for it, but luckily I lost it. I need to take more pics and get that battery charged, it is annoying that my dad has that charger. I wont go home until ORGNAME v ou so I won't get it until then, damn. I really want the fall to come, where the days are always in the 00's and 00's it is such beautiful weather, and no humidity so my hair doesn't go crazy on me. Arg, I just need to pace myself today, I don't want to be doing work late tonight, I want to finish around 0 or something, that would be nice. 
__label__label1      this is the weirdest thing I have ever had to-do. right now my roommate is watching the graham PROPNAME effect and it is hard to concentrate. the show is really funny. he just changed the channel I am going to ask if could turn it down a little. Yesterday I had a really good date. it is all I can think about today. I hope things turn out good because I don't want to be hurt. I went to the gym today. I like and dislike working out. I like the end result and the feeling after working out, but I hate the feeling before I have start working out. I want to go out tonight. I don't have class on Fridays so I feel obligated to go out and do something. I got some people to go salsa dancing. nobody has really confirmed f they're going or not. I kind don't want to go anymore, but since some people already said yes I have to go. I am sure I will have tonight. this is really strange. I am just spilling out random thoughts. I really like the guy I went on date with. Well I don't know if I like him or if I like the idea of being with him? I guess time will show. I am tired of being single. I want a boyfriend! I was at the gym and I felt for some reason really aroused. I usually don't get aroused at the gym but today I saw a really hot guy that I couldn't get out of my head. I wonder if that is  BAD THING to like a guy but still be really turned on by other guys. I know it is perfectly normal but I would have tired something with this guy if he had asked me to. maybe that's why people think I am whore. I m really sexual. I am really worried about getting in the communication school. I think about everyday. if I don't get in I don't know what I will do if I don't get in. I just had dinner by myself. I hate eating by myself. I think it is because I had no friends when I was growing up. I have friends now but tend to want them around to much. I want to have sex I hope ya'll don't read this because are going to think the worst of me, but at the same time I don't what anybody thinks of me. for the most part. I keep looking at the clock to see how much time I have left. I hope I am doing this right because if I am not than I will be really mad. my is cool but he tends to be an ass sometimes. he was just over my shoulder reading this. I told him not too and then he stop. he is watching Seinfeld now I wish I could enjoy the show right now. Wait no he is watching the king of queens. my mistake. I can concentrate now because I don't like that show. I have a lot of pretty friends. 
__label__label1   Okay I was asked to write about the way that I'm thinking this is an pretty easy assignment, but then comes what am I suppose to write about and is it really that easy to put thoughts to paper. I know one thing is I sure do really want to go back to houston where life was much easier and fun. Here people are to damn concieted and full of them selves, theis mainly means the females, maybe its cause I'm hispanic or something. Either way I never had diffulty meeting girls. Well its probably cause I miss my gurl my lil china back in h-town. PROPNAME what else mann I'm bored and tired and I wonder why my led hurts. Its been doing that all week. I'm not as athletic as I use to be that makes me sound like an old person. But foreal though its so boring out here parties are bunk. Who the called me today have no idea who was that girl I wish I knew who she was thought she sounded reallly good though. Lets see what else is there to say I don't really feel like college has got hard yet but I feel it coming. I hope I'm ready when all the hard works hits me BAAaMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!  Just like that. I realize that I do think of gurls a lot that's crazy even right now I'm talking about gurls haaaa. Hmmmmm will I meet a girl out here who will at least be my friend. Maannn this stupid computer is slow and these dum pop ups keep coming up man I didn't realize that 00 min was this long man I forgot how to type fast so ill just use this as practice I guess. Soooooooo lets see Wow there sure is a lot of porn online stupid popups trying to distract me all the time just leave me alone like micheal jackson mann that guys weird I feel srry for those kids lol. no but really that's sick I'm on 00 min and 00 sec. hmm doesn't seem like I said a lot so man I really not liking austin if this continues I'm going back home. I don't kjnow though I got freedom here like I would have in houston there I got a person watching me which is goood but how willl I ever grow without learning on my own. I actually learned how to wash clothes out here that's a big accomplish ment seein that I never did that. Yep I can a lot if I put my mind to it those white kids won't know what hit them when I get all my grades up and start knowing more people imma take there gurls lol. Then every body willl be on my swangers foreal  mann those cookies smell good but if I take my hands off the keyboard then ill stop typing and that's no good screw it let me get a cookie. Hmmmmmmmmm that's good lol. I feel like I'm chatting ca;use I just don't care about grammer. I need some music its so boring and what kind of crap do they jamm down hurrr its so weak and so is the dancing. yup good old h-town inned to go back and chill with my friends and especially PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME man forreal though I miss her most of all its like when I say I miss houston I mean her cause she's the only thing worth going back for. maybe in the future if it was meant to be ill meet here again and well fall in love all over agian!  I wish but she's beatiful she wouldn't be single and she's just perfect. I heart her. 
__label__label1      I guess  I will talk about the guy I was dating before I came here, since I just got off the phone with him before I got on the computer to complete this assignment. After dating him for two months I realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. There are no straight rules to follow. Everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. At first I was so confused by this guy  because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. After just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. Right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. I think that is weird. I guess I will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. I still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but I am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. I had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. I was thinking I could never do that. I think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. Because I believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and I are not together. I thinkI'm still new to the dating thing because I don't understand it. I try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. I have mostly dated older people. My first real boyfriend was seven years older than I. That relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than I was. His majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. I think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. After breaking up with him I felt I needed a boyfriend and I even felt a little lonely. Now I am fine and mostly dated for fun I guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. I gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others I find attractive or of high standing and what I don't want my future husband to have one day. Not to say I am definitly marrying someone but I hope I will find that right someone. For right now though I am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before I ever get married I want to have finished school for my own personal goal. You can't always rely on others in life so if I get a good education I can get a good job to support myself. This has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. Because that someone else might not always be there. This has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I hope I fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what I was thinking about. I feel confused by relationships and I guess I should be and I am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well. I just hope everything will work in the long run and so I'll try not to worry about because I used to worry about things to much that I would stress my self out. 
__label__label0 well I guess it'll be good to get this out of the way. Let's see what's on my mind. ok I think I need to turn off the TV and maybe turn on a little music. this seems like it could get boring. hmm. maybe that's a bad sign that I think my thoughts are goig to be boring. anyway, all right, the tv's off and now the musics on. much better. well I'm officially pledging phi delt tonight. I'm going to be assigned my big brother at the meeting this evening and I'm pretty excited. I think this is going to be a lot of fun. john's pledging with me and I guess we're going to get to be pretty good friends. this is kind of nice. this is a good way to clear my thoughts up. I've heard before that writing out everything makes you slow your thoughts to the pace of writing and it's an effective way to clear your head. what kind of phrase is that. clear your head? that's a weird thing when you actually think about it. ok I can't talk about one thing for very long. wow this time is going pretty fast. it doesn't seem like I've been writing long at all and I'm a quarter of the way done. ok well let's accomplish something productive here. what do I need to do today? I need to get khakis and a white shirt for tonight. hmm I wonder what I should do about shoes. I didn't bring my dress shoes I don't think. that's one bad thing about being 0 hours from home. when I remember something that I forgot to bring, or didn't think I would need, there's not much I can do about it. ok what else do I need to do today. its labor day. I like not having class. umm ok think, I need to study chapter 0 in biology. really I need to review all of the chapters that's got to be my biggest priority today. and I need to finish reading my psych chapters and philosophy stuff. I feel like I always  have something to do. it was this way in high school too though so I guess its not that bad. there's a guy pledging with me that reminds of somebody famous but I can't place it. I don't think I've ever heard this song but I know the band. that's not saying much for the band. or maybe it is. either they have a unique sound or all of their songs sound too much alike. I don't know which it is in this case. maybe a little of both. ok the time is not going as quickly as I thought it was. do I have anything else to do today? clothes, read, umm I've talked to my mom today about everything I think I needed to tell her. I paid my stupid parking ticket. there's 00 bucks wasted on me stupidity. I thought about appealing it but they called out my exact reason for the appeal on "reasons not to appeal your ticket" apparently just being a dumbass isn't a valid reason. I love this song. barenaked ladies are a good band. I want to see them in concert again. oh concert. I can't wait for the acl festival coming up. and next weekend I'm going to mexico with the phi delts. oh this is going to be a lot of fun. I'm excited for so many things this semester. I just need to make sure I keep my grades up and everything. I'm sure I will. I don't forsee myself slacking off at all. if I want to get into medical school I need to have the best grades possible. but then I don't know if I really want to go to medical school. I need to talk to an advisor about this stuff. hopefully I can get into my fig advisor tomorrow and see what he has to say. I can't decide if I want to major in neurobiology or switch to liberal arts and look into psychology. I think this is a really interesting field but at the same time I feel like its uhhh I lost my train of thought. lets see. I feel like its umm something that too many people do. its over done as a major I guess I don't really know what word to use to describe it. woo! one minute remaining. umm so yeah psychology is really interesting. I'm actually not dreading reading the rest of the chapters. in fact I'm kind of looking forward to it. ok well the times up I guess I'll quit now. that was fun. 
__label__label1 so this is the first entry, and it happens to fall on a day when things are really. Shitty. I don't know if I have the desire to join the rowing team, though I've already told everyone that I was going to; my internet connection was messing with my earlier, a reason to cry in itself; my relationship with a boy I don't know enough about. Lets start with that. I've been dating him for about a year and a half, and I don't know who he is. will he cheat on me?  is my relationship anything to be worried about?  if a stranger looked into our lives, would he giggle, surprised at the immaturity of our  relationship?  is it anything to try to save?  I hope so, if not I'm a fool. but I think I'm one anyway. but PROPNAME PROPNAME, he knows his shit, it seems. or its that he knows that he doesn't know his shit. I wish I knew. I wish I knew him as well. though his devotion is something that would automatically clash with me. I have nothing against christians or their beliefs. I wish I could give myself up to that with no regrets. But I can't. I've been down that road, and its lead nowhere. have I spoiled my chances with a true love by being with brian?  will I ever be content in my own two damn shoes?  will I ever feel like I'm at home? will I be successful?  would I be happy without success?  it seems like the lives people live are all too perfect, even the less desireable, that there's some author out there, other than someones god, writing the stories of our lives. but he forgot me?  why am I not going anywhere, why can't I find this happiness and joy. my life is pathetic at this point. maybe its just this horrible attitude, but the only time I feel like I can be happy (or at least not pissed off) is with brian, laying in his bed, thinking of everything and nothing all at the same time. but how does this conflict so much with the previous statements?? it would seem that I am happy with him, but then comes the doubt and fears. I need to find myself, I say. only thing is. I don't know what that means. does anyone? its really this unattainable goal people teasing set in your minds. A state you need to obtain, but its in fact unattainable. the sad bastards who were told the same thing when they were younger are enraged that they don't know how to go about it, and they then ruin the lives of everyone after them, so they can suffer justly. I wish I were born in the old days, when you died of a flu and there wasn't such a thing as AIDS. people lived lightly, they wrote, they read, sometimes found something to revolutionize, but mostly enjoyed the simplicity of life. where did that virtue go?  how has it managed to slip through the fingers of time, and where would it have gone?  I wish I could sift through the ashes of our charred world, seeking only the beauty and peace that once was everywhere, but now seems like you have to search for only to get the smallest glimpse of it. how come I can't be a writer?  how come I can't write?  I want to study people, not medicine. why would I declare this major?  if I studied other peoples lives all the time, would I have a life of my own?  is true adulthood worth it?  people always want what they can't get. I get what I don't want. everything always seems like it gets really good, I mean reaaaally good, right when its about to end. will college be like this?  will life itself be like this?  will I stop asking so many damn questions??  will he call?  would I want him to? I don't want this life. anyone want to trade?  I want a life of the storybooks, of unquestionable love, faith and virtue. knowledge, hope, and an impeccable body would be nice too. I want all the money in the world, I want to live in a time without money. I want to be a movie critic, I hate bad actresses with hair that doesn't fit their character. I hate living with someone other than who I love. I hate not knowing if its really the true love they talk about. I hate being inadequate, I hate second guessing everyone. I hate being critical. I hate chocolate chips. I hate gaining weight. I hate stretchy jeans that don't look good. I hate running out of time, I hate trying to fill time. I hope this class makes me realize a few things about myself, although I'm not sure why it would. Seven six five four three two one. 
__label__label1      I'm already starting to feel stressed out, and I haven't had any tests yet. It's only been two weeks of school so far, and I feel like I have so much to do. I guess it's typical for for an incoming freshman, since it's new and all. I've never felt so busy in my life. Watching TV, my old passion, seems like such a waste of time to me now. If I have spare time, I could actually be checking out LOCNAME, like the duck boat, which our RA told us about. It seems so cool!! A tour bus turning into a boat ?? It's craziness, and a little scary. We supposedly may go as a hall, which I highly doubt because we don't seem to have hall unity or whatever. I guess I had a misconception of how dorm life would be. At this point, I think getting an apartment would have been just fine, other than the fact that I'm way closer to my classes living on campus. Ok so maybe dorms aren't so bad because I don't think I want to wake up like an hour earlier for the whole public transportation fiasco. I really need to figure out the bus routes because I don't know where any of the buses going other than forty acres and far west, which I accidentally got on to during orientation. It was a great detour. Wow, 00 minutes is a long time, I just realized that. I guess I was comparing it to how long it takes me to do everything else, it seemed like nothing. So yea, back to the stressed out business. I've had something to do since the beginning of summer, since I took summer 0 at a community college, then I went to PROPNAME, LOCNAME to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister-in-law out with the hotel they own there. I worked and got paid. Good stuff. A few days after I got home from PROPNAME, I made my way to LOCNAME. My new home in the Kinsolving dormitory with all the other chics. And I think we all know how busy things are around here. I thought Christmas break would be relaxing and chill time, but I was mistaken. For I found out my closest cousin is getting married January 00, the weekend before classes start. This means that for Christmas break, I will be helping out with the wedding, which from experience already I know is very stressful. And my cousin has asked me to do a dance at her wedding, which is an Indian tradition for a younger girl in the family to entertain the guests with a vivid dance. So now I have to pick a song and choregraph a dance and learn it to perfection so I can perform it in front of hundreds of people. Did I mention that I am a nervous person who freaks out easily ?  Oh and by the way, the wedding is in LOCNAME LOCNAME, and the reception is in LOCNAME a weekend later, so I have to go back home after a week of being in LOCNAME, followed by who knows how long of being in LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME. My home is in LOCNAME, a little town of pop. 00,000 in LOCNAME LOCNAME, just two hours north of LOCNAME, 0 hours south of LOCNAME, and four hours east of LOCNAME. Man oh man, this is going to be a hectic year. And to think I thought studying for my classes was my biggest worry. Well maybe I will grow from all these things, in stead of losing my mind. I guess we'll see. Hey, that kind of relates to Psychology huh ?  Maybe I can be a case study, which I read about in the textbook.        
__label__label1 So, I can now finally begin this writing. I am pretty relaxed right now because I have a wonderful boyfriend. He is funny, sweet, and weird like I am. I feel like I am writing in a journal. Trying to track my thoughts is weird because I feel like I jump from one idea to the next really quickly. It is almost as if I am ADD in the mind. That sounds weird. I keep hearing this ticking from this tiny pink watch that is sitting right next to me. It surprises me how loud it ticks for being a wrist watch. Now, I can hear the television from the living room. It sounds pretty interesting. I can hear the air condition vent outside the apartment complex. The air just turned off now but the vent is as loud as can be. I like the noise of the keyboard when I type. Especially when I type fast. The clicks make me think that I am really accomplishing something. I am going to stop talking about sounds now and try to see what my mind is does. Write now I am a little tired. My brain seems a little slow right now. I feel a little overwhelmed by the school work load along with my sorority obligations and my job. I am happy thinking about my sorority. I love the girls! Everyone of them make me feel important ant that I really matter. All the girls are so fun to be around too. We all love to go out to parties and dance. Man, that car outside that just passed through was very loud. The music was rap and not very good. I do not understand sometimes why people ride around at night with really loud music and their windows down for everyone to hear. It seems kind of dumb to me that it is a week day night and there are people out there thinking they are all cool. Man this watch ticking is really bothering me. It's amazing how many things I hear when I really think about things. This means I am not talking which is a really good accomplishment for me. I love to be social and visit with everyone. I just remembered that I am missing music. Normally, when I type or do any homework I like to listen to some music. When I do math, I can listen to any kind of music I want. But if I have a paper or any readings, I can only listen to classical music. Speaking of music, I had my first T. A. session for my History of Rock class. It was really interesting. The teacher is pretty cool and nice. We get to listen to all kinds of music every class. The only thing is it seemed to me like I was learning all about how music works again like as if I was in band all over again. Man, I keep looking at the clock and just realized that my twenty minutes is almost up. I remember looking at seven minutes thinking that this was going to be a long twenty minutes. I was wrong. I am almost done and it went by so fast. My stomach doesn't feel too well. I think I ate too much marshmallows. Also, my head hurts now. Maybe I just didn't eat enough today. I only have          
__label__label0 Ok well I'm thinking about how long of a day it was, I got to school kind of late and I was almost late to my first class. I'm not really smelling anything right now because my nose is a little stuffy and runny I think it is due to my girlfriend who has been getting sick lately, we went to buy tylenol cold at the target on 00. I just spoke to here and she said that she was going to take a little nap and I told her not to because she was complaining all day that she had so much to do and there wasn't any time to do it. Well she didn't listen to me she said for me to call her at 0:00 if she hasnt called me. she went with me to psy class today even though she already took it last semester. she was very moved by the way the professor was. I think she said I wish I had him for my psy class. I told before that he was very cool like our communications teacher dr. daly who is a very cool teacher as well, his class is awesome he's so charismatic, today we had a supplemental discussion for that class and I have my girlfriends friend from back home in that class who just broke up with her boyfriend whom she had been going out with for about two years or so, and we were just talking and she was telling me how she hated our comm. class because all they talk about in that class is relationships and she feels sad every time he uses one of the students as examples, now on the topic of my girlfriends friends. By the way her name is desiree and she is beautiful and I love her a lot, I don't know when and where but someday we plan on getting married, I think we are different than most couples, I know that everybody probably says that but I really do think that we are because yes we spend a lot of time together and I hear that that is a bad thing but were different because we involve God in our relationship, not as much as we should but more than most couples I think, in the summer we read the bible every night for the last couple of weeks. But since we got up here, we haven't read it at all, I think its because were so happy with each other and we love to spend time with one another that its hard to do something else besides kissing and having sex at night. now back to her other friend named nancy. Well she is rooming with desiree's old roommate kelly, and well a few days ago kelly had a talk with nancy, she was really mad from what I hear because she took the time to underline in the contract that no one else has permission to stay for more than three consecutive nights in their apt. without some kind of notice, and well nancy has a boyfriend who is always over there and kelly gets really mad. Me and desiree were thinking that she is just jealous because her boyfriend isn't over there as much as he should be. like my roommate said that he wasn't going to talk to his ex when he came up here because she broke up with him last year when she was still in high school and he was up here. well now that she is up here too, he said that he was not going to talk to her at all, well shit that didn't last very long, just the other night he stayed at her dorm because they had to homework for the same class that they both share. Hmm. What a coincidence, I mean me and my girlfriend had a class last together too and I think that that helped out a lot because no matter if we didn't see each other every day we definetly saw each other on those days that we had class, I mean we really werent together yet but that certainly helped out our relationship a lot. my friend oj keeps calling me because he wants to go eat at the olive garden and I told him that I don't know because I running tight on money and I kind of got in trouble the other day with my mom because I went on a little shopping spree and spent a good amount of money at diesel. the part that she got mad at was the jeans that I bought for 000 dollars and that's because they were on sale. she said imagine how many shirts u could have bought with that. so I don't know if ill go but I do want to play him in ORGNAME 0000 college football that's like our fav game and my roommate just bought a big screen with a surround sound so its awesome to play on that I haven't even tried it I think I'm going right now to go play laterz!          
__label__label0 Here I sit wondering just what to write that involves my stream of consciousness, which shouldn't be too hard. Writing for me is usually pretty easy, however this assignment seems to be particularly hard. Maybe because I feel partially tired and torn down from my long day. I am looking forward to tomorrow because Thursdays are probably my easiest days because I will not have to wake up at the usual 0am and oh yeah it is also one day closer to the weekend!  Although I have to say that 0am is also a lot better than 0am, which was time I had to arrive at school during my high school days. Since high school just popped into my mind, I have to say that college is a major leap from high school. Despite the fact that it is more enjoyable it also is a lot more stressful. For instance, leaving your family, friends, and so forth behind. Not to mention your adolescence. I am happy to say that the transition for me has ran pretty smoothly although the major bumps are yet to come. One of my "bumps" that I am experiencing is the massive amount of reading involved, at one point I enjoyed reading but maybe that is because the reading is not usually my preferred choice. Another obstacle is that it it is your choice whether to read or not, in fact it is just another realization that I am out in the real world and everything is based upon my choices. I find that very scary, yet also very exciting in a positive way because I can make my future what I want it to be.  
__label__label1      it is often very cold in the Fac the smurf lab especially they call it the smurf lab because it's a student microcomputer facility the acronym and its meaning both absurdly out of date. the computers are new and black the keys crunching crisply under my sore and tired fingers sore and tired from a 0 hour lab drawing three dimensional models in a computer, changing materials, trying to get travertine to stick to cool, airy software. a man comes in (a boy a man) and sits at the computer I usually use but couldn't because his stuff was there. he pulls a sandwich out of a bag, readjusts his hat, takes a slow bite of the sandwich and gets back to work chewing and biting calmly and contentedly as if preparing for a long night which will require nourishment of a complete sort. complete nourishment completed with a drink of some brownish liquid like all other brownish liquids we drink as humans nearly indiscriminately. 0 minutes four minutes of aching arms and hands nerve cells firing the table to my brain, the itch on my right cheek to my brain, the cool air of the place to my brain. I love to write. I love to think in written form, to read the words in my brain, to think nothing but print if I can manage it. Not just in a case like this as if I ever had a case like this - but in all of my life, my every day. My speaking to others has quotation marks around it, descriptive ways of describing what I describe. I always want to write discribe and I don't think I ever have until now because always my mind ( the silent one, the one that doesn't think in word sounds or print) my silent mind stops my hand and puts an e there because it's right, because I knew that from the beginning but the part of my brain that lives in kindergarten, brown bear brown bear what do you see? - tells me so. No it tells me iiiii iii aye aye aye eye eye eye but it's eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I live in an apartment on my own now I can barely get it out of my head because it was so beautiful when I moved in  bare clean white bright new and beautiful and I keep it so clean and I love that about the apartment and I love that about me. I love to keep it all perfect. any one in the world could walk in the door and other than my messy grammar of any one's and every thing's there would be nothing out of place. I could open the door to the world and there is nothing shameful lying about no dirty plates and cups no clothes on the floor no mess around the sink. It's all clean as I'd like my life to be and am so gradually making it. The separation of church and state - the separation of method and emotion. Somehow I now think of star trek - oh, vulcans. Those crazy vulcans. I loved the next generation but I could never stomach any of the other iterations- the other shows in the series. The next generation was so right - picard so venerable, so rarely stooping to kirks weaknesses or the others' stupidities. So french, so proud. they made this archae not anthropological finding of some skull of some ancient form of man (in real life, not star trek) and they goyt got some graduate student or artist or pro or whatever to make a cast and then cover it with skin and eyes and hair to recreate the face of ancient man and it accidently turned out to look like patrick stewart and everyone thought hey ancient man looked like patrick stewart and they said no it didn't it's just a mistake but it was a great funny mistake anyway. I think a lot about william and henry james. I just read portrait of a lady over the summer and then to read ab out william in the psych book was so great so great to think that brothers could accomplish noteriety in separate fields to think that greatness was inherited from their father but they still so outshone him. my father has a software company and employs a man named john stewart which I think of because of patrick. He (john) drives a brand new red car red what corvette that's it. a red corvette so new that at the corvette show they didn't have one and paid him to put it on display. did they pay him?  my ear itches. They used to say in elementary school if your ear itches someone is thinking about you who thinks about me. The boy in the chair I usually sit in is thinking about me because I see him glance up from time to time in the corner of my eye. He eats like a man watching football, chews with his mouth open swallows gulps too large to imagine. so close to done and I loved doing this because I never write anymore. s 
__label__label1 I'm thinking about bush and religion. I just had a simi arguement about it. I don't really care for the way the government is trying to impose religion on everyone. country music isn't that bad. I use to hate it in high school and now I've found a liking for it. tomorrow I go to nachadoches to visit friends. I'm looking forward to the driving and getting away from it all. I don't like being stuck down here. my room is really quiet. so is my roommate. we don't talk much. hopefully we'll open up and start to talk a bit. my legs itch and so does my back. I'm really full. that large pizza was really good. but the sight of pizza would make me really sick. I still can't stop thinking about government. it all just sickens me. I wish there were better canidates to choose from. face itches. I'm actually happy tonite. I got an A on my physics homework. ugh, physics was made by the devil, I swear. its like they don't want you to ever pass that class. leg itches. I'm a little stressed though. my shoulders and neck are all tight. I think its because of my whole financial aid deal. hopefully it will all be in by tomorrow so I can have some money for this weekend. arm itches. I really like country music. stomach itches. I miss old friends. maybe ill try to fix that this semester. get back in contact with old friends or try to stay in contact. I need to stop missing calculus class. its not like its hard. I just need to go and pay attention. I need to shave. I just need the time to do it. it takes forever. my chair is comfy. I don't like how my monitor is set-up. I wish I didn't have to turn my neck to look at the monitor. I wonder who is winning the patriots/colts game. I hope the colts win. I don't want to see the pats win anymore. I really like the underdogs, except when its UT playing. got to support the home team. astros finally lost a game. 00 straight and then a lose. hope they won the second game of the doubleheader. now I see why I people don't like country music, it puts you in a more mellow mood. not sad but not happy. more of a reflective mood. man, this summer was awesome. I can't wait til next summer. college intern at cypress united methodist. 000 kids, wow! a girl from katy died today. some people from the mission trip knew her. its so sad to be taken at such a young age. texas better beat arkansas Saturday. ill be pissed if they lose again to them. I itch a lot. my beard especially. that's why I need to shave it. ugh, 0am class tomorrow. I thought freshman year was going to be the only year I had them. oh well, the class is easy and entertaining. I can't wait for this to be over. I really wish me and my roommate would talk more. it gets kind of akward in here when we are just sitting at our computers not talking to each other. I need to excercise. I'm feeling lazy. I want to play raquetball. it was great when I hit ash in the head with the ball and then when I fell on my butt when trying to serve. great times. my beard still itches. I think I'm going to go shave soon. its driving me nuts. this is a lot like writing in a journal. just a lot more random. but being random is fun, it throws people off.      
__label__label1 I didn't sleep at all last night and I'm barely making it through my day. I feel like a zombie, but hey what's new?  I have an english paper due on Monday. I think I completely bombed the thesis. I guess I can always go back and change it. I'm tired, I can't think. that's a lie, of course I can. it will simply be rambling nonsensical jumble. and that counts too right? sure it does. I've been seeing this guy. he's about seven years older than I am, and that shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it's more of an age difference than anyone I've dated before. I can meet him on an itellectual level, conversation isn't lacking, there's physical attraction and the whole deal. so why am I so doubtful? I suppose because I'm paranoid about becoming an obnoxious needy stereotypical girl. Unfortunately I have been that to others in the past and refuse to ever play that part again. I'm so much stronger now, more confident and comfortable with myself as a person. Anyway, my point is I'm scared to let him know I'm sincerely intersted because I think it will freak him out and send him running in the other direction. I can make my intentions known without actually verbalizing my feelings. And I'm pretty sure at this time in the relationship- whatever time it might be- is too soon to bring up any of those concerns. Is he seeing anyone else? Does he care? Does he not want to hurt my feelings so he won't tell me he doesn't want to hang out? it's so ridiculous to hear myself think like this. basically I'm so afraid of rejection that I'm willing to do it myself, before anyone really gets the chance. I've dated a plethera of losers over the past year and I'm tired of not caring about anyone. anyone in that way I guess. yes I have friends and have plenty to do without a guy to entertain (that sounds really harsh- it is me that wants this. )but I miss that connection. I want to be in love again. but who doesn't? I suppose once I stop wanting it I'll find it. that's the way of the world sometimes. yeah but about him. it is what it is and if it doesn't work out than so be it. plenty of fish in the sea and all that. but he does have some potential. enough of this. it's making my head hurt. I don't like that my stream of consciousness has turned into more of a "dear diary" than anything else. I'm sitting in the student microcomputer facility among my fellow longhorns at the moment. I wonder how many of them are doing this assignment right now. maybe none. everyone's in their own little worlds. deep inside their thoughts or their research. everyone seems so disconnectced, though I suppose that's the point of this place. a quiet area to get work done, not social hour. I'm about to go to ecology evolution and society. I've been reading the assigned chapters, but I fear that I'm not actually retaining any of the information. I guess it will become quite apparent when I get my first test scores back. all I want to do here is to do well. it's the only reason I'm living in austin again, to continue my education. so that's what I aim to do. make the most out of the billion things I have to accomplish today. cross them off my list and get them out of the way in order to make room for all the new. life is pretty enjoyable when you don't let it drag you down with the minor negative aspects. so many people do that. drown in their own self pity and reamin miserable regardless. just smile sometimes, it really can make you feel better, and probably someone else as well. that's what I think, but this mind of mine is all over the place and never seems to rest. the end. my time is up.                            
__label__label1      I'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder. Everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another. I keep asking myself whether or not I'm am going to make it in my major. My major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major. My friends say they don't know what I got myself into, but I keep telling them I'll be fine to not worry about me. When I say this I am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that I will be fine. This library is all to silent I think I just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing. While I'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not I am going to make an A on the chemistry exam on Tuesday. I feel bombarded with chem and I don't know if I am going to be able to remember all three chapters. My mind keeps telling me that I will be fine that I just have to get used to it. High School was so much different than college in that you had to much time you didn't know what to do with it. That hasnt been my problem lately the only problems I have had all are about having not enough time. Every time I talk to my girlfriend back home, a senior in high school, I tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy. I know older people had told me the same but I really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating. Oh yeah I am getting off topic but this library is just boring me. I feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything. I feel like they all grasp the ideas that I don't. In high school I was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me. Maybe that's just me overthinking. I can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library. It smells like a piece of chocolate. Maybe it is a candybar of some sort. I don't really care because that smell kind of nauseates me. I am not a real big fan chocolate but I do love chocolate ice cream. Something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure. Lately I have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend. I miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away. SHe is graduating a semester early from HS and is going to move to austin and attend ACC for the remainder of the year. I offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents. I hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass. Her father moved from italy to LOCNAME in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name. The man now owns a 00 million dollar business that he started from nothing. He now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal, not spaghetti out of the jar, for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day. All she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things. She is one of the most ungrateful people I have ever encountered in my whole entire life. People who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but I see the real her everyday. 
__label__label1      Right now I am sitting here typing, with the tv on in the background and I am feeling very tired. I think this is because I didn't get nearly enough sleep last night. Why didn't I get enough sleep, you ask. Well I don't know. I usually go to bed sometime before eleven, or sometime right before twelve and sometimes after twelve. I guess you could say between 00 and 00, right? Yeah. And I start my day somewhere around 0:00. That is NOT NEARLY enough sleep. But what's funny is this is the only time of day when I feel really lethargic: around 0 or six o clock. Maybe it is biological. Maybe we all feel tired at certain points according to our bodies. I think there should be a law that we all have to take siestas in the afternoon like they do in LOCNAME. That seems glorious. Not to mention it's good for you! You are more refreshed and able to handle tasks more efficiently and with more energy. Even as I type I can feel myself drifting off. Do not fall asleep. Do not fall asleep.  Oh great. I pressed a wrong key and now the time started over. I had two minutes of typing under my belt. That's beautiful, just beautiful!!! I think I will just sit here and make up for that time. Doop de doop. Doop de dooooop. . . . . . Well, I'm very glad it's Friday tomorrow. Not that it makes much of a difference, but still. I can sleep in on the weekend, that's a big deal to me. I'm not sure what I'll do with the weekend. Probably catch up on reading for classes. I'm really concerned about that. I've been slacking off a bit and that's just awful, classes have only been in session for what, just two weeks or something. Yuck. I'm such a procrastinator. Well, I don't know what else to talk about. This is boring and I'm getting bored just doing this because I'd rather be napping. Not to mention the clock says only 0 minutes and I KNOW the true time should be somewhere around five!!!! Here, this is entertainment. I will type out a poem completely from memory. Ladies and gentlemen, The Road Less Traveled by PROPNAME PROPNAME: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry I could not travel both and be one traveler, long I stood and looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black oh I saved the first for another day yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubt if I shall ever come back I shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and I, I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference. What a beauty of a poem, no? I've always liked it. Don't remember why I had to memorize it. probably for a class way back in middle school. Some people have told me they don't understand the last line. I just feel secret annoyance towards them. What's there not to understand?! It's clear as a bell, people!   I like PROPNAME PROPNAME. Here's another one I know called Fire and Ice: Some say the world will end in fire Some say in ice From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire but if it had to perish twice I think I know enough of hate to say that ice is also great and would suffice  I also like Stopping by Woods On a Snowy Evening, the one that ends "And miles to go before I sleep. " Yep. Also that poem called Nothing Gold Can Stay. Why do I know so much about PROPNAME PROPNAME you ask?! Heck you got me. I don't even know. I just think his poems are nice. What other poets do I like. That's a good question. I have no idea. Well, that's probably not true, but I can't think of any at the moment. In Decathlon in school we studied lots of poems, by PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME (a really bad one, though) and PROPNAME PROPNAME and lots of other peeps. Some of them were cool, some were most definitely not. I think I will write a poem of my own, right here, right now. I call it "The Cat Came Home". The Cat came home and he thought he was there to stay but what he didn't know was that the owners had moved away They left the lights on They left dishes in the sink The Cat came home and in a swift minute didn't know what to think Should I stay or should I go The Cat asked himself that day What should I do about this What should I say? Well The Cat found no answers just an empty litter box So he said, Eh who cares and tore up all the socks  Maybe I should get that one published!  Well my time is almost up thank goodness, so I should think of an appropriate end to this free writing assignment, a summation if you will. This was mainly about poems and poets and the unsolved mystery of why I don't get enough sleep. Yep, that's all. Nothing too exciting. And what do you expect. There is absolutely nothing worthwhile on TV at this moment. 
__label__label0 My thoughts are everywhere right now I am thinking about getting my computer fixed because it has a virus. I need to sleep that is the biggest change for me in college is the late nights and busy days I am used to busy days from high school but not the late nights. It is strange but interesting and fun being semi independent I have another late night tonight that I am not quite ready for but it is my pledge line for KA which will be another consumer of much of my time but it should be very fun once pledgeship is finshed I am looking forward to getting to meet and become close with my pledge brothers because being from a smaller town I don't know as many people as a lot of folks down here but I didn't want go to school with all my old high school friends  really because I wanted to meet new people I do miss my best friedn though he is somebody I could always talk to trip out with and just we knew what we are thinking without having to say anything it is strange not having a best friend down here right now and its tough because it takes lots of time and lots of escapades and wild nights bad times good times high school sports all those things made us great friends and now I have to try and make some more friends like that here in austin my roommate  just left and I am still trying to make my decision about that situation he is an alright guy but he is not really the type of person I see myself spending lots of time with but I am sure I will being roommates and joinin the same fraternity but I always look at it as it could be a lot lot worse. lost my train of thought sorry I'm having trouble focusing today I feel very out of it but I've got class in a while so I won't be able to take a nap I think I am getting sick and rundown hopefully I can shake this little congestion I have but with all the new stress in life these days I don't know how well that will work out I'm not feeling to great at all sometimes I wonder if LOCNAME is the right place for me and that is just a backand forth thought cause some days it is and some times when its a bad day I wish I was back home in my own bed with dog I miss her haha that sounds so cheesy haha but she is a good dog and she always will cheer you up I can hold a thought today it seems like I feel like I am being random but some how I feel like I keep saying the same things I am not looking forward to walking to class I don't like that very much and I get to search for the computer shop to drop my laptop off to get this virus taken care of that is a pain I feel like I havent met enough people yet I want to be more outgoing but I am naturally more of a quiet person I enjoy listening and watching other peoples behaviors and stuff I like to feel people out and get a sense of who they are before I just start relaxing around them I try to be assertive and approachable and outgoing but that doesn't always go so well and people take my quietness in the wrong way it is often seen as me being stuck up angry rude and that drives me crazy but all I can do is be who I am        
__label__label1      I havent really decided what to write about. so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like I could write for a very long time. I do that though, I have a journal and its handy. I like to go back and read what I write and think to myself 'what an idiot'. its a learning experience really, and I hope more people use journaling to express themselves. Some people use online journals which at first I thought was odd because I write personal stuff in my journal. I wouldn't want the internet world to read all that. but then I started reading my friend's online journals and actually started one myself. PROPNAME calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she'd like to be different. That reminds me of PROPNAME, he is the classic conforming nonconformist. he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates. especially lauren. their relationship is odd in that way. PROPNAME makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us. he is an interesting person to study. I am always observant but observing him is just interesting. he's like a girl and I swear he has PMS. we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he didn't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group (david and I didn't want to either) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually. but then the next day, he still didn't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we Couldn't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea. he just left. he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time. the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he's cool. so he'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy. he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night. I don't know if I belive him but I really don't care. the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr. popular. of course he wasn't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you don't care. He is such a confusing boy. I mean, they're all confusing but he takes the cake. having liked him before, I knew what I was getting into the last time. and the time before that. his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky! so now I feel bad like I'm just judging everyone I know. grr. that's a noise I make, I make many of them. I make many faces too. at work john laughs at me because I can't control my expressions. especially if someone says something dumb. I just can't hold it in. my moms the same way. I wonder if that's learned or inherited. anyway. speaking of mom, my parents moved to florida in feb. and march. it was ok at first because I was of the opinion that I was getting an apartment so I wouldn't be living with them and wouldn't see them much anyway. but man I was wrong. I visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached. while I was there dad did the same annoying things he's always done, not listening, asking questions I'd just asked etc. drove me nuts. but now I miss them a lot. I was listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME and she has a song called nobodys home. and I realized that I have no where else to go. this apartment is my home now and man that's depressing. the kitchen is dirty, the floors are dirty, we need to steam clean, lauren and katie are bums and it took them 0 days to clean out MY cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak. people would call this bitterness. I like to claim that at least I'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like I tend to do. I took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website. it said I was an ESTP? I think. anyway, part of it said that I would tell people what I think. I don't know how correct that is because I am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much ALL my friends will say crap. PROPNAME is the most tactless, when she and sean got together I was quite angry. and still when I think about it I get angry at her. why not at him? I don't get that. but when I typed his name I accidentally wrote sew. I am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because I keep thinking of things. like today as I walked across campus I was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make. I've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but I just. didn't. and now, even though I'm busy with papers to write etc, I really want to get creative. PROPNAME's sewing machine is here still but it didn't work very well. I can't remember how badly it ran but I should probably check that before I buy one. I don't know how much they'll cost either. I think $000 at walmart? but I don't want a plastic one. I'm sure I could break it and I'd rather have machinery than plastic. I think I should inheirit mom's old one and she can get a new one. but I said that once and she said no way. whatev. I'm tired. I tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 000 I think. I don't remember exactly but 0 or less hours of sleep sucks. and I've been doing it for days. that's probably not good. another thing that's probably no bueno is that I HATE my job. and this isn't like the first year I worked at culvers and I was just a lazy bum. I am good at my job, I do it well, I used to enjoy serving customers. but now it has  been REALLY hard to make myself go. and its not like I'm just going to call in sick, I just don't want to go. I want to hit almost all of my coworkers, the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager. I don't get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place! and he's weirdly energetic. and since lauren and david have told me the same, I know I'm not the only one whos creeped out by it. well goodbye my 00 min were up a few sentences ago. 
__label__label0  Hi. My nPROPNAMEe is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. Usually when PROPNAME have to write something I like to introduce myself first. I did not prewrite this I promise. I was born November 00, 0000 (PROPNAME day before Thanksgiving). I am now 00 years old and am excited about being in the college ORGNAME engineering ORGNAME the ORGNAME PROPNAME ORGNAME at ORGNAME as a Biomedical engineering major. I love to play sports (volleyball, softball, and track), write poetry, praise dance! and enjoy nature. Some things that I would like to do before I leave LOCNAME or before I graduate college are to go horseback riding again (preferably, to take horseback riding lessons), to go kyacking ( I don't have a clue right now as to how to spell this word), to go parasailing with a friend of mine and to visit the capitol and some of the musuems in the city. I would also like to get involved in a good service organization. I love service and helping other people. Oh!  About my family. I am the PROPNAME of PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME of LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. I have one older sister, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. My father works for a nuclear plant, my mother is a teachers aide, and my sister is in the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. She (my sister) has been overseas twice (yes, to LOCNAME as well--she said that where she was wasn't that bad at all). She has now been restationed to florida. This makes me really nervous sometimes because we are predicted to have a pretty bad hurricane season this year and many of them hit florida. She picked a bad state to go to. Anyway, I told my sister that she could go wherever she wanted as long as I could come and visit at least once (ha! Like I could really decide where she would go. I just thought I'd try it). She would have flown me to LOCNAME to go see the sites and to go see the pyramids in LOCNAME but my mom wouldn't let me go. She didn't want the both of us over there. However, I plan to go visit in LOCNAME either during Christmas break or Spring Break. My thoughts have now shifted to the PROPNAME family. This is a family or couple that I meet on a plane my eighth grade summer. I had gone to National Baptist Conference in LOCNAME and was flying back to houston by myself. They told my god-mother, who was with me before the flight, that they would keep an eye on me. When we got to houston we exchanged info and said we would keep in touch. Now, usually when this happens, people don't really keep in touch but in this case we have kept in touch for over 0 years now. We send each other cards, call each other and all that good stuff. I think that that is just amazing. What esle to talk about???? OK I am just getting words now. (Friends, other homework, love,Oh) Let me tell you about the home I would like. I was raised in a somewhat country area and I came seem to get awat from that. I would like to build a big country house with a large bay area window, sunlight roof in the kitchen or some area of the house, maybe a lake, and I know that I want horses, dogs, and cats. I don't know why but this picture always comes into my head when I think of what I want my future home to look like. Also I have to have a porch that goes all the way around with at least one swing on it and most definitely atleast one walk in closet. I don't know exactly where I would like this house but I think I would like it to be somewhere in LOCNAME. Time is almost up and this is about all that I can think of right now anyway so bye and I will see you next time. The one and only.   
__label__label0      I always have a million thoughts going on in my head but now that I am asked to write about them, I can't. I wonder where the printers are. its already 0:00. its so quiet in here. I wonder if this girl next to me knows where to print. it looks like she's buisy. this keyboard is dirty, the keys are hard to press. I shouldn't have thrown away my smoothie. its so dull in here. its already getting dark. I hope I'm spelling okay. I can't wait until tomorrow. "and I love you, and its more then I ever knew. " (I'm singing in my head). its too quiet, like we're not allowed to talk, its kind of depressing. I'm so glad I learned to type. I hope I can download my calculus homework on this computer. I hope I understand it. this weekend I go home. but the best part is going to be the six hour drive with my boyfriend. he's great. and I love him more everyday. I hope this feeling lasts. I would love to marry him, in like 0 years. he's great and we're great together, I miss him. I just saw him yesterday but I miss him. I'm hungry. I think ill take dinner up to my room and socialize with my roommate. I wonder what I'm going to eat today. I had a sandwhich yesterday. I should eat something hot. hmm. I guess I could have chicken strips. or vegetables. oo, and a salad. is that how you spell oo. oh, eww, uh, oo. ? oh well. now its 0:00. I wonder if I need glasses? this watch is bothering me. ah, there. my foot hurts so much. I wonder when the swelling will go down. I should email my dad. I hope my string doesn't come off. I forgot to put my rings back on. I hope I don't lose them. tomorrow I have an easy day, and I get to see fili. yah. yeh. ya. whatever. my head hurts. I should eat. what did I eat today. cereal. soup. hmm. I should eat dinner after this. I have so much reading to do. but its labor day weekend, so ill do a little bit each day and then finish this weekend. wow, my time is almost up. I hope I'm doing this right. hmm. I think so. I wish I could gain weight, well in certain places more then others. now someone else is sitting next to me. hmm. its so weird how there are so many oriental students here, its almost as if they are the majority. but that can't be right. it must just seem that way. there are so many people and I don't know any of them. someones chair keeps squeaking. oh, I need to sign up for those informal classes. what is that ringing. I don't think cell phones are allowed in here. I need to write a letter to danny. I wonder if hanna plays this weekend. I know they do. but where? hmm I need to find out, but soon. I wonder if I should tell my parents about me going home this weekend or just surprise them. I don't know which one is better or worse. oh well. that chair squeaked again. I don't see any printers. hmm. I should stop looking around, people are looking at me funny. its almost eight. I need to read. I wonder if the timer goes past twenty minutes or if it keeps going. well that answers my question. 
__label__label0 Hello, I don't know why I feel that I have to greet you, but I do. and I don't know who "you" are, because I have never tried to communicate with myself. that is so strange to me because I should know me well, because I am me. So. a stream of conciousness, eh? lets begin with the first thing I  look at: the keyboard. it is black, and the lettering is in white, capital letters. I know each of these letters by sound, and sight. how did I learn these? with out them I wouldn't even be here doing this. now I am hearing things. people all around me logging onto their computers just typing away, researching away. now a man is asking a question to one of the information people here. I don't know who they are, like how to adress them, that is. but they are here to help. and for some reason that makes me feel at ease. at ease from  what? I don't know . I guess the world is enough to make my being feel uneasy. my existence in this world makes me feel like I need to be recognized, sensed, felt, heard, or loved. isn't that strange? why do I need to feel this way? I don't know. but that's how I feel. moving on- what is another sense? I've gone over what I am looking at, what I am hearing and what I am feeling. but feeling in an emotional sense, not physical. I could have said I am feeling the contact between my fingers and the keyboard, but instead I chose to elaborate on my internal emotions, and that is not one of the five senses. isn't that strange? so that covers three out of five. what am I tasting right now? well, I don't know how to answer that. I don't know how to describe the taste of my mouth. and even if I was still eating, how could I explain the taste of a hot dog or fries or a banana? the only thing I could say is that "my mouth tastes like hot dog, fries and banana. " but that isn't necessarily what it really does taste like right now. now it tastes like nothingness, I suppose. what does nothingness taste like? I could ramble off synonyms, such as void or empty space even. but that doesn't mean anything untill a person consciously experiences it. right? like when a person learns what strawberry tastes like. there is no possible way to explain exactly the flavor of a strawberry. mmmm strawberries are delicious. that's all I would be able to say. and now I am actually CRAVING a strwberry! even me typing the word, and the big capital way that I spelled "craving" makes me want it even more. I am now trying to take my mind off of the mouthwatering fruit so that I can finish the last three minutes or so of this paper before I leave to go get some strawberries. it is a pretty strong urge for me to leave now but I have discipline. and that is what makes me different from everyone else. I have discipline. I won't leave now because my grade is so important to me. and its paying off, you know why? because I only have 00 more seconds to go!!! I am very happy now at the hought that I don't have to type any
